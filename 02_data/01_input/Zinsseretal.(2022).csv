1,Assessment of the combined effect of epstein-barr virus and plasmodium falciparum infections on endemic burkitt lymphoma using a multiplex serological approach,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a necessary cause of endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL), while the role of Plasmodium falciparum in eBL remains uncertain. This study aimed to generate new hypotheses on the interplay between both infections in the development of eBL by investigating the IgG and IgM profiles against several EBV and P. falciparum antigens. Serum samples collected in a childhood study in Malawi (2005-2006) from 442 HIV-seronegative children (271 eBL cases and 171 controls) between 1.4 and 15 years old were tested by quantitative suspension array technology against a newly developed multiplex panel combining 4 EBV antigens [Z Epstein-Barr replication activator protein (ZEBRA), early antigen-diffuse component (EA-D), EBV nuclear antigen 1, and viral capsid antigen p18 subunit (VCA-p18)] and 15 P. falciparum antigens selected for their immunogenicity, role in malaria pathogenesis, and presence in different parasite stages. Principal component analyses, multivariate logistic models, and elastic-net regressions were used. As expected, elevated levels of EBV IgG (especially against the lytic antigens ZEBRA, EA-D, and VCA-p18) were strongly associated with eBL [high vs low tertile odds ratio (OR) = 8.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.81-15.64]. Higher IgG responses to the merozoite surface protein 3 were observed in children with eBL compared with controls (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.02-1.64), showing an additive interaction with EBV IgGs (OR = 10.6, 95% CI = 5.1-22.2, P = 0.05). Using elastic-net regression models, eBL serological profile was further characterized by lower IgM levels against P. falciparum preerythrocytic-stage antigen CelTOS and EBV lytic antigen VCA-p18 compared with controls. In a secondary analysis, abdominal Burkitt lymphoma had lower IgM to EBV and higher IgG to EA-D levels than cases with head involvement. Overall, this exploratory study confirmed the strong role of EBV in eBL and identified differential IgG and IgM patterns to erythrocytic vs preerythrocytic P. falciparum antigens that suggest a more persistent/chronic malaria exposure and a weaker IgM immune response in children with eBL compared with controls. Future studies should continue exploring how the malaria infection status and the immune response to P. falciparum interact with EBV infection in the development of eBL.",Africa; Children; Endemic Burkitt lymphoma; Epstein-Barr virus; IgG; IgM; Multiplex; Plasmodium falciparum,"Aguilar, Ruth; Casabonne, Delphine; O'Callaghan-Gordo, Cristina; Vidal, Marta; Campo, Joseph J.; Mutalima, Nora; Angov, Evelina; Dutta, Sheetij; Gaur, Deepak; Chitnis, Chetan E.; Chauhan, Virander; Michel, Angelika; de Sanjosé, Silvia; Waterboer, Tim; Kogevinas, Manolis; Newton, Rob; Dobaño, Carlota",2017,10.3389/fimmu.2017.01284,0,1
2,Effect of two methods of introducing foods during feeding treatment on acceptance of previously rejected items,"The effects of using a single food item (e.g. bread) versus using multiple items (e.g. bread, pasta, and rice) when establishing food acceptance via an escape prevention procedure were investigated with six children who presented with food selectivity. Eating was exposed to a differential reinforcement of food acceptance treatment package but food acceptance did not improve. Criterion levels of appropriate eating (>80% acceptance, <20% expulsion, and <20% disruption) were subsequently established with either nonremoval of the spoon or physical guidance for each of the participants. Three of the children were presented with only one food item during acquisition of acceptance. The other children were presented with three different food items from the same food group. It was found that acquisition of acceptance was more rapid for the single-item group but that food acceptance was more likely to generalize to previously rejected items for the multi-item group. The implications for clinical intervention are discussed. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Ahearn, William H.",2002,10.1002/bin.112,0,2
3,An Assessment of Food Acceptance in Children with Autism or Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified,"Some children with autism and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) have been reported to have atypical feeding behavior, such as sensitivity to food texture and selective preferences for particular foods. No systematic studies of feeding behavior in this population have been published. Munk and Repp (1994) developed methods for assessing feeding problems in individuals with cognitive and physical disabilities that allow categorization of individual feeding patterns based on responses to repeated presentations of food. In this study, we systematically replicated the Munk and Repp procedures with children with autism and PDD-NOS. Thirty children, ages 3 to 14 years, were exposed to 12 food items across 6 sessions. Food acceptance, food expulsion, and disruptive behavior were recorded on a trial-by-trial basis. Approximately half of the participants exhibited patterns of food acceptance, indicating selectivity by food category or food texture. Others consistently accepted or rejected items across food categories. Whether these patterns of food acceptance are atypical remains to be determined by comparison with the feeding patterns of typically developing children and other children with developmental delays.",Autism spectrum disorder; Feeding assessment; Selective eating,"Ahearn, William H.; Castine, Todd; Nault, Karen; Green, Gina",2001,10.1023/A:1012221026124,0,3
4,"Lead and Juvenile Delinquency: New Evidence From Linked Birth, School, and Juvenile Detention Records","Using a unique data set linking preschool blood lead levels, birth, school, and detention records for 125,000 children born between 1990 and 2004 in Rhode Island, we estimate the impact of lead on school suspension and juvenile detention. Sibling fixed-effect models suggest that omitted variables related to family disadvantage do not bias OLS estimates. However, measurement error does. We use IV methods that exploit local (within-neighborhood), variation in lead exposure deriving from road proximity and the deleading of gasoline. For boys, a 1 unit increase in lead increased the probability of suspension from school by 6% and detention by 57%.",,"Aizer, Anna; Currie, Janet",2019,,1,4
5,Experiences of Gender Minority Youth With the Intrauterine System,"Purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate the experience of menstruating adolescents identifying as male or gender nonconforming with the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) as a method of menstrual suppression and compare to that of cisgender youth (CGY) using the LNG-IUS for noncontraceptive indications. Methods: A retrospective chart review of gender minority youth (GMY), aged 12–22 years, who self-selected the 52 mg LNG-IUS for menstrual suppression between June 2014 and January 2018. GMY were then matched for age and time of insertion with CGY. Subjects were contacted by telephone to further explore LNG-IUS experience such as if the device was still in place, method satisfaction, current bleeding patterns, and for GMY improvement in menstrual distress. Results: Thirty GMY had the LNG-IUS inserted during the study period, and 20 GMY were matched with CGY for age and time of insertion. GMY were significantly more likely to receive sedation for LNG-IUS insertion (50% vs. 15%, p =.04). Otherwise, the LNG-IUS experience was similar between groups, including mean number of telephone/office visit encounters for an LNG-IUS concern, expulsion and reinsertion rates, and need for additional medications to control bleeding. On average, the mean months of use was 14.5 ± 8.6 months in GMY and 14.6±11.5 in CGY (p =.97). LNG-IUS removal was documented in three (15%) of GMY and five (25%) of CGY. Improvement in menstrual distress was reported by 80% of GMY after the insertion of the LNG-IUS. Conclusions: Overall experience with the LNG-IUS was similar for GMY and CGY, and menstrual distress and bleeding pattern improved in the majority of GMY who self-selected this method for menstrual suppression.",Gender minority youth; Levonorgestrel-intrauterine system; Menstrual suppression,"Akgul, Sinem; Bonny, Andrea E.; Ford, Nancy; Holland-Hall, Cynthia; Chelvakumar, Gayathri",2019,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.11.010,0,5
6,The development and evaluation of a simple method of gestational age estimation,"Aims The aims of this study were to develop and evaluate a shorter gestational age estimation method based on the Dubowitz scoring system (DSS) that could be taught easily to untrained health-care workers. Methods: Using the DSS, seven criteria were identified that explained 90% of the variance in gestational age estimation. Ventral suspension was excluded, skin texture was substituted for skin colour and ear bending was for ear firmness. The final six criteria comprise the short DSS (SDSS). The study population was 100 babies, 51 Caucasian, 34 Aboriginal. Birth weight ranged from 1351 to 5430 g. The gestational age range was 29.6-41.7 weeks. Three researchers (medical student 1 (MS1), medical student 2 (MS2) and a paediatrician) who were blind to other available gestational age estimations assessed babies within 72 h of birth using the DSS and SDSS. Results: MS1 found the 95% limits of agreement (LOA) between SDSS and DSS to be -1.1 to 1.7 weeks. In the 27 babies who had first trimester foetal ultrasound (USS), the LOA between USS and SDSS were -1.9 to 1.4 weeks and -2.3 to 1.9 weeks, respectively. Using the SDSS, the LOA for the three researchers were within ±2 weeks. Conclusion: The data presented suggest that the SDSS is approximately equivalent to the DSS in the relatively limited population studied, and within these limitations appears to be a simple alternative to the DSS. Further evaluation is needed before firm conclusions about the accuracy and clinical utility of the SDSS can be made. © 2008 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (Royal Australasian College of Physicians).",Gestational age; Low birth weight; Preterm infant; Ultrasound,"Allan, Rachel C.; Sayers, Susan; Powers, Jennifer; Singh, Gurmeet",2009,10.1111/j.1440-1754.2008.01429.x,0,6
7,"Early lead exposure (<3 years old) prospectively predicts fourth grade school suspension in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (USA)","School suspensions are associated with negative student outcomes. Environmental lead exposure increases hyperactivity and sensory defensiveness, two traits likely to increase classroom misbehavior and subsequent discipline. Childhood Blood Lead Level (BLL) test results categorized urban fourth graders as exposed (2687; lifetime max BLL 10-20 μg/dL) or unexposed (1076; no lifetime BLL ≥5 μg/dL). Exposed children were over twice as likely as unexposed children to be suspended (OR=2.66, 95% CI=[2.12, 3.32]), controlling for covariates. African American children were more likely to be suspended than white children, but lead exposure explained 23% of the racial discipline gap. These results suggest that different rates of environmental lead exposure may contribute to the racial discipline gap. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Blood lead; Discipline gap; Disparities; Lead exposure; School discipline; School suspension,"Amato, Michael S.; Magzamen, Sheryl; Imm, Pamela; Havlena, Jeffrey A.; Anderson, Henry A.; Kanarek, Marty S.; Moore, Colleen F.",2013,10.1016/j.envres.2013.07.008,1,7
8,Patients with pediatric obstructive sleep apnea show altered T-cell populations with a dominant TH17 profile,"pbjective. To characterize the immunologic changes of the tonsil as they correlate with increasing apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) in children. Study Design. Prospective immunologic analysis. Setting. Tertiary care pediatric otolaryngology practice. Subjects. Tonsils were collected from 24 children with obstructive sleep apnea, all of whom had undergone polysomnography at an accredited sleep center using scoring determined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2007 scoring manual. Patients were excluded if they had been diagnosed with craniofacial abnormalities, neuromuscular disorders, or immunodeficiency. Methods. Single-cell suspensions were isolated from tonsils of 13 individuals and stained with flu or-conjugated antibodies and analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Single-cell suspensions from tonsils of 11 additional individuals were incubated 21 hours and subjected to multiplexed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay cytokine analysis. Results. In patients with an AHI >5 events/h, there was a statistically significant increase in the fraction of CD4+ CD45RO*T cells (P < .01), and the percentage of CD8+ FoxP3+ T cells (Tcreg) showed a statistically significant decrease (P < .005). Cytokine analysis revealed high levels of interleukin (IL)-I7A, IL-lb, IL-10, and IL-I2p70 production. Cytokine profiles revealed a conspicuous absence of IL-4 and IL-2. Conclusions. Our results indicate the tonsils of patients with obstructive sleep apnea have an ongoing inflammatory response characterized by increased effector CD4 T cells and decreased FoxP3 CD8 T cells. The THI7 skewing suggests that local immune activation may be either autoimmune or due to an extracellular pathogen. © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2014.",adaptive immunity; apnea-hypopnea index; effector T cells; FoxP3; IL-17; obstructive sleep apnea; regulatory T cells,"Anderson, Martin E.; Buchwald, Zachary S.; Ko, Je; Aurora, Rajeev; Sanford, Thomas",2014,10.1177/0194599814521780,0,8
9,Gut microbial products regulate murine gastrointestinal motility via toll-like receptor 4 signaling,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Altered gastrointestinal motility is associated with significant morbidity and health care costs. Toll-like receptors (TLR) regulate intestinal homeostasis. We examined the roles of TLR4 signaling in survival of enteric neurons and gastrointestinal motility. METHODS: We assessed changes in intestinal motility by assessing stool frequency, bead expulsion, and isometric muscle recordings of colonic longitudinal muscle strips from mice that do not express TLR4 (Tlr4Lps-d or TLR4-/-) or Myd88 (Myd88 -/-), in wild-type germ-free mice or wild-type mice depleted of the microbiota, and in mice with neural crest-specific deletion of Myd88 (Wnt1Cre+/-/Myd88fl/fl). We studied the effects of the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on survival of cultured, immortalized fetal enteric neurons and enteric neuronal cells isolated from wild-type and Tlr4Lps-d mice at embryonic day 13.5. RESULTS: There was a significant delay in gastrointestinal motility and reduced numbers of nitrergic neurons in TLR4Lps-d, TLR4-/-, and Myd88-/- mice compared with wild-type mice. A similar phenotype was observed in germ-free mice, mice depleted of intestinal microbiota, and Wnt1Cre+/-/ Myd88fl/fl mice. Incubation of enteric neuronal cells with LPS led to activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-κB and increased cell survival. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between enteric neurons and microbes increases neuron survival and gastrointestinal motility in mice. LPS activation of TLR4 and NF-κB appears to promote survival of enteric neurons. Factors that regulate TLR4 signaling in neurons might be developed to alter gastrointestinal motility. © 2012 AGA Institute.",Apoptosis; Intestinal Transit; Microbiota; Mouse Model,"Anitha, Mallappa; Vijay-Kumar, Matam; Sitaraman, Shanthi V.; Gewirtz, Andrew T.; Srinivasan, Shanthi",2012,10.1053/j.gastro.2012.06.034,0,9
10,Black Girls and School Discipline: The Complexities of Being Overrepresented and Understudied,"Using Critical Race Theory and Critical Race Feminism as guiding conceptual frameworks, this mixed-methods empirical study examines Black girls’ exclusionary discipline outcomes. First, we examined disciplinary data from a large urban school district to assess racial group differences in office referral reasons and disparities for Black girls in out-of-school suspensions, law enforcement referrals, and expulsions. Next, we used a multivariate analysis to determine whether these patterns held after accounting for other identity markers. Finally, we used Critical Discourse Analysis to consider whether office referrals for Black girls were for subjective or objective behaviors and whether they aligned with dominant narratives.",Black girls; racism; school discipline; School-to-Prison Pipeline,"Annamma, Subini Ancy; Anyon, Yolanda; Joseph, Nicole M.; Farrar, Jordan; Greer, Eldridge; Downing, Barbara; Simmons, John",2019,10.1177/0042085916646610,1,10
11,OTO-201 for the Treatment of Acute Otitis Externa: Results from a Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Study,"Objectives: OTO-201 is a ciprofloxacin otic suspension previously approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat children with bilateral otitis media with effusion requiring tympanostomy tube placement. In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, prospective, sham-controlled, multicenter study, a single dose of OTO-201 was administered to the external auditory canal in subjects with unilateral or bilateral acute otitis externa. Methods: Two hundred sixty-two subjects, 3 to 83 years of age, were randomized, and 260 subjects were included in the intent-to-treat analysis population: OTO-201 (0.2 mL, 12 mg, n = 130) or sham (air injection, n = 130). The primary efficacy measure was clinical cure (CC) on day 8, judged by blinded assessor for erythema, edema, otorrhea, and tenderness. Subjects were monitored over 28 days for efficacy and safety. Results: OTO-201 demonstrated a significant increase in CC compared with sham at day 8 (69.2% vs 46.1%, P <.001). Higher CC was also noted on day 4 (P =.028), day 15 (P <.001), and day 29 (P <.001). A similar effect was observed in the pathogen-positive population. Single OTO-201 administration in the office setting was well tolerated by subjects. Conclusions: In this study in subjects with acute otitis externa, a single administration of 12 mg OTO-201 to the external auditory canal demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of subjects with CC and bacterial eradication compared with sham starting on day 4 and on all other observation days through day 29, with no safety or tolerability concerns identified. OTO-201 is the first agent in a randomized phase 3 study to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a single-dose, health care professional–administered topical antibiotic for the treatment of acute otitis externa.",acute otitis externa; ciprofloxacin; clinical cure; OTO-201; otorrhea; single-dose antibiotic; thermoreversible; thermosensitive,"Ansley, John; Mair, Eric A.; Namini, Hamid; Lu, Chung H.; LeBel, Carl",2019,10.1177/0003489419830116,0,11
12,The persistent effect of race and the promise of alternatives to suspension in school discipline outcomes,"Demographic and student discipline data were used to examine the influence of multi-level risk and protective factors on exclusionary school discipline outcomes. Participants included all youth (n. = 87,997) in grades K to 12 who were enrolled in Denver Public Schools (n. = 183) in 2011-2012. The dataset included measures of risk and protective factors for exclusionary school discipline outcomes such as race, family poverty, special education status, emotional disability, participation in gifted and talented programs, homelessness, office referral reasons over the course of one school year, participation in in-school suspension, a behavior contract, or restorative approaches, and school composition. Multilevel logistic regression modeling was used to estimate students' likelihood of receiving one or more office disciplinary referrals, suspensions, expulsions, and/or law enforcement referrals. Findings indicate that student racial background and school racial composition are enduring risks across key decision points of the school discipline process. Conversely, participation in restorative interventions and in-school suspensions protects students from out-of-school suspensions. This study suggests that ongoing attention to issues of racial inequity in school discipline outcomes is warranted, and that restorative practices have potential as an inclusive strategy to improve school discipline outcomes without excluding students from the classroom. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Alternatives to suspension; Racial disparity; Restorative approaches; School discipline outcomes,"Anyon, Yolanda; Jenson, Jeffrey M.; Altschul, Inna; Farrar, Jordan; McQueen, Jeanette; Greer, Eldridge; Downing, Barbara; Simmons, John",2014,10.1016/j.childyouth.2014.06.025,1,12
13,Acceptability and Feasibility of Using Raltegravir Oral Granules for the Treatment of Neonates in a Low-resource Setting,"BACKGROUND: Raltegravir granules for oral suspension, now recommended by World Health Organization for use in neonates with HIV infection, may be challenging for caregivers because of the multistep preparation required. METHODS: We evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of preparing granules for oral suspension in a low-to-middle-income country setting. Thirty-four caregivers and 10 health-care workers were enrolled from an HIV clinic in Durban, South Africa. Health-care workers were provided with pictorial instruction booklet, demonstration kit and guidance on preparation of granules for oral suspension. The health-care workers then trained caregivers on the preparation of granules for oral suspension. Caregivers were evaluated during the preparation process and instructed to practice at home with a sample kit and return to the clinic for repeat evaluation 5-7 days later. Caregivers and health-care workers were interviewed and participated in a focus group discussion regarding their experiences. RESULTS: The median age of the caregivers was 31 years (interquartile range: 9.7); 70% had received secondary-level education, 37% were employed. The median preparation time was 7.95 minutes (interquartile range: 5.08 minutes) and 7.48 minutes (3.55 minutes) at initial and repeated observation, respectively. Major errors were insufficient mixing time and incorrect suspension volume. The average number of errors between the 2 observation time points was significantly reduced at the repeat session (2.5 vs. 0.87, P = 0.023). Most participants found the preparation difficult at first but gained confidence over time. CONCLUSION: Despite the complexity involved in the preparation of the granules for oral suspension, with practice, this formulation was found to be acceptable and feasible to majority of participants in this low-resource setting. As a result, this formulation was included in the 2018 World Health Organization recommendations for first line in neonates living with HIV.",,"Archary, Moherndran; Zanoni, Brian; Lallemant, Marc; Suwannaprom, Puckwipa; Clarke, Diana; Penazzato, Martina",2020,10.1097/INF.0000000000002539,0,13
14,"Biannual mass azithromycin distributions and malaria parasitemia in pre-school children in Niger: A cluster-randomized, placebo-controlled trial","Background Mass azithromycin distributions have been shown to reduce mortality in preschool children, although the factors mediating this mortality reduction are not clear. This study was performed to determine whether mass distribution of azithromycin, which has modest antima-larial activity, reduces the community burden of malaria. Methods and findings In a cluster-randomized trial conducted from 23 November 2014 until 31 July 2017, 30 rural communities in Niger were randomized to 2 years of biannual mass distributions of either azithromycin (20 mg/kg oral suspension) or placebo to children aged 1 to 59 months. Participants, field staff, and investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary malaria outcome was the community prevalence of parasitemia on thick blood smear, assessed in a random sample of children from each community at study visits 12 and 24 months after randomization. Analyses were performed in an intention-to-treat fashion. At the baseline visit, a total of 1,695 children were enumerated in the 15 azithromycin communities, and 3,029 children were enumerated in the 15 placebo communities. No communities were lost to follow-up. The mean prevalence of malaria parasitemia at baseline was 8.9% (95% CI 5.1%–15.7%; 52 of 552 children across all communities) in the azithromycin-treated group and 6.7% (95% CI 4.0%–12.6%; 36 of 542 children across all communities) inthe placebo-treated group. In the prespecified primary analysis, parasitemia was lower in the azithromycin-treated group at month 12 (mean prevalence 8.8%, 95% CI 5.1%–14.3%; 51 of 551 children across all communities) and month 24 (mean 3.5%, 95% CI 1.9%–5.5%; 21 of 567 children across all communities) than it was in the placebo-treated group at month 12 (mean 15.3%, 95% CI 10.8%–20.6%; 81 of 548 children across all communities) and month 24 (mean 4.8%, 95% CI 3.3%–6.4%; 28 of 592 children across all communities) (P = 0.02). Communities treated with azithromycin had approximately half the odds of parasitemia compared to those treated with placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.54, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.97). Parasite density was lower in the azithromycin group than the placebo group at 12 and 24 months (square root–transformed outcome; density estimates were 7,540 parasites/μl lower [95% CI −350 to −12,550 parasites/μl; P = 0.02] at a mean parasite density of 17,000, as was observed in the placebo arm). No significant difference in hemoglobin was observed between the 2 treatment groups at 12 and 24 months (mean 0.34 g/dL higher in the azithromycin arm, 95% CI −0.06 to 0.75 g/dL; P = 0.10). No serious adverse events were reported in either group, and among children aged 1 to 5 months, the most commonly reported non-serious adverse events (i.e., diarrhea, vomiting, and rash) were less common in the azithromycin-treated communities. Limitations of the trial include the timing of the treatments and monitoring visits, both of which took place before the peak malaria season, as well as the uncertain generalizability to areas with different malaria transmission dynamics. Conclusions Mass azithromycin distributions were associated with a reduced prevalence of malaria parasitemia in this trial, suggesting one possible mechanism for the mortality benefit observed with this intervention.",,"Arzika, Ahmed M.; Maliki, Ramatou; Boubacar, Nameywa; Kane, Salissou; Cotter, Sun Y.; Lebas, Elodie; Cook, Catherine; Bailey, Robin L.; West, Sheila K.; Rosenthal, Philip J.; Porco, Travis C.; Lietman, Thomas M.; Keenan, Jeremy D.",2019,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002835,0,14
15,"Suspensions and detentions in an urban, low-income school: Punishment or reward?","Disciplinary records for 3rd through 8th grade students (n = 314) in an inner-city, public school were examined for one school year to assess students' variation in response to discipline. Rates of disciplinary referrals were compared for students who received no detentions or suspensions throughout the year (""never group"" n = 117), students who received one or more detention or suspension in the fall but not in the spring (""fall group"" n = 62), and students who received one or more detention or suspension in the fall and one or more detention or suspension in the spring (""fall + spring group"" n = 75). Results indicated that during the fall, the ""fall group"" had nearly equivalent rates of referrals to the ""fall + spring group""; however, the ""fall group"" exhibited significantly lower rates of referrals during winter and spring that were nearly equivalent to the ""never group,"" as would be expected for a punishment procedure. In contrast, the ""fall + spring group"" evidenced increases in referrals across the year, suggesting the possibility that detentions and suspensions were functioning as rewards for this group. The ""fall + spring group"" was rated by teachers and peers at mid-year as highly aggressive, lacking social skills, and high on hyperactivity, whereas the ""fall group"" and the ""never group"" were statistically equivalent on teacher and peer ratings.

16,Does head start yield long-term benefits?,"Using a new data set, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97), this paper examines the relationships between Head Start and school suspensions, grade retentions, and scores on math achievement tests. The body of previous work that has studied the effects of Head Start on child outcomes has examined relatively young children or small samples from compensatory preschool programs other than Head Start. Using the NLSY97 helps to remedy some of the data issues because it is a large nationally representative data set and contains outcomes up to the teenage years. The estimates indicate that Head Start participation does not have long-term benefits. This finding is compatible with past work showing that compensatory preschool programs that are long in duration and intensive are more likely to improve participants' outcomes.",,"Aughinbaugh, A.",2001,10.2307/3069637,1,16
17,Double rhomboid suture technique for congenital ptosis,"Purpose: Congenital ptosis is a troubling eye condition for pediatric ophthalmologists. There are many considerations to contemplate when deciding when to operate and which technique to use. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 69 pediatric patients treated for congenital ptosis using a double rhomboid frontalis sling with a nylon suture at a single tertiary care center. Results: For patients with more than 6 months of followup, there were 38 patients with 46 primary surgeries (22 [58%] males and 16 [42%] females). The average age at the first surgery was 39.34 ± 33.18 months. There was a mean follow-up time of 51.87 ± 53.79 months. There were 7 children who needed one revision and 1 child who needed a second revision, equaling a 23.9% rate of revision. Patients who had surgery before the age of 3 years had a statistically significant likelihood of needing a second surgery (chi-square test = 7.246, P = .007, 95% confidence interval = 0.027 to 0.687). It was also statistically significant (P < .05) that, throughout childhood, older patients were less likely to need a revision. Conclusions: A double rhomboid frontalis sling using a nylon suture is an effective technique to treat congenital ptosis. This technique is easy to master and has a low cost compared to techniques involving autografts and allografts. It is also important to advise the family of the likelihood of a second surgery if there is a need to operate at a young age.",,"Bach, Austin; Sanchez-Gonzalez, Marcos; Warman, Roberto",2018,10.3928/01913913-20171101-01,0,17
18,Episodic use of an inhaled corticosteroid or leukotriene receptor antagonist in preschool children with moderate-to-severe intermittent wheezing,"Background: Acute wheezing illnesses in preschoolers require better management strategies to reduce morbidity. Objectives: We sought to examine the effectiveness of episodic use of an inhaled corticosteroid and a leukotriene receptor antagonist in preschoolers with intermittent wheezing. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-month trial, 238 children aged 12 to 59 months with moderate-to-severe intermittent wheezing received 7 days of either budesonide inhalation suspension (1 mg twice daily), montelukast (4 mg daily), or placebo in addition to albuterol with each identified respiratory tract illness (RTI). Proportion of episode-free days (EFDs) during the 12-month trial was the primary outcome. Results: The 3 treatment groups did not differ in proportions of EFDs, with adjusted mean EFDs of 76% (95% CI, 70% to 81%) for budesonide, 73% (95% CI, 66% to 79%) for montelukast, and 74% (95% CI, 65% to 81%) for conventional therapy (P = .66). The 3 groups did not differ in oral corticosteroid use, health care use, quality of life, or linear growth. However, during RTIs, budesonide and montelukast therapy led to modest reductions in trouble breathing (38% [P = .003] and 37% [P = .003], respectively) and interference with activity scores (32% [P = .01] and 40% [P = .001], respectively) that were most evident in those with positive asthma predictive indices. Conclusions: In preschool children with moderate-to-severe intermittent wheezing, episodic use of either budesonide or montelukast early in RTIs, when added to albuterol, did not increase the proportion of EFDs or decrease oral corticosteroid use over a 12-month period. However, indicators of severity of acute illnesses were reduced, particularly in children with positive asthma predictive indices. © 2008 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.",budesonide; montelukast; preschool children; Wheezing,"Bacharier, Leonard B.; Phillips, Brenda R.; Zeiger, Robert S.; Szefler, Stanley J.; Martinez, Fernando D.; Lemanske, Robert F.; Sorkness, Christine A.; Bloomberg, Gordon R.; Morgan, Wayne J.; Paul, Ian M.; Guilbert, Theresa; Krawiec, Marzena; Covar, Ronina; Larsen, Gary; Mellon, Michael; Moss, Mark H.; Chinchilli, Vernon M.; Taussig, Lynn M.; Strunk, Robert C.",2008,10.1016/j.jaci.2008.09.029,0,18
19,The billion dollar costs of troubled youth: Prospects for cost-effective prevention and treatment,"A follow-up study of 227 youth (to mean age 19.5) excluded from school and transferred into special behavioural units found that 63% had criminal convictions after leaving formal schooling, at age 16. Thirty percent had been convicted of “violence against the person”, and 31% had served or were serving prison terms. Twenty six percent had been convicted of 10 or more crimes. The costs (conservatively estimated) of servicing this cohort since the age of 12 (including child care and school exclusion costs) were at the very minimum US$45,472 per individual. Generalising these figures to the national estimates of at least 15,000 youth formally excluded from school in England and Wales, and transferred to special behavioural units, indicates a cost to the public purse of at least US$682 millions by the time these youth are 19.5 years. Lifetime costs are likely to be very much higher, amounting to several billion dollars. It is argued that spending a fraction of this money on preventive and supportive social and educational services in the school years would be highly cost effective. More research into why some individuals do not enter the cycle of criminality is also urgently required. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Bagley, Christopher; Pritchard, Colin",1998,10.1080/02673843.1998.9747825,0,19
20,The reduction of problem behaviours and school exclusion in at-risk youth: an experimental study of school social work with cost?benefit analyses,"A three-year experimental programme of school social work involving 2.5 workers was introduced into a primary school and a linked secondary school serving deprived council estates with high rates of unemployment, poverty and crime and high rates of exclusions from school. In comparison with two similar schools which acted as controls, the experiment was reflected in a stat-istically significant reduction in rates of self-reported theft, truancy, bullying, hard-drug use and net exclusions. Analysis of reduction in school exclusions showed that the experiment was highly cost-effective. Qualitative evaluations supported findings from stat-istical comparisons, suggesting that school social work can be effective in both preventing children coming into care and im-proving school climate and teacher morale.",,Bagley; Pritchard,1998,10.1046/j.1365-2206.1998.00101.x,0,20
21,Getting developmental science back into schools: Can what we know about self-regulation help change how we think about “no excuses”?,"Research from education, psychology, and human development indicates that social and emotional skills are essential to success in school, work, and life, and that high-quality social and emotional learning (SEL) programs can benefit students’ mental health, academic achievement, and behavioral outcomes. While many schools are adopting an SEL approach, there remains a concerning gap between SEL research and policies and practices related to discipline and behavior management. Following the No Child Left Behind Act and education reform driven by a culture of high-stakes standardized testing and accountability benchmarks, there has been an increase in elementary schools adopting a “no excuses” model of education. This model is characterized by extended time in school, highly structured in-service teacher training, frequent assessments, and “zero tolerance” policies to strictly manage and control children’s behavior. These behavior policies are problematic as they run counter to what research tells us about children’s social and emotional development. Reactive and exclusionary discipline policies inhibit children’s abilities to build and practice self-regulation skills and jeopardize the relationships between students and teachers. The developmental science perspective on children’s regulatory skills suggests that the early years of school are a central context for developing and practicing self-regulation with the support of educators and peers. Research also indicates that warm, caring, reciprocal relationships based on trust are critical to learning and development. Yet, this research base is often overshadowed by pressures to improve standardized achievement scores or misinterpreted in the form of hyper-vigilance about children’s behavior in the classroom. Finally, the “no excuses” approach to behavior management is used disproportionally in schools serving low-income students of color and thus may contribute to unequal rates of suspensions and expulsions, both of which are linked to negative developmental outcomes later in life. This is particularly true for students who have experienced trauma, in part because the act of social exclusion is often re-traumatizing. This article summarizes research on self-regulation, trauma, and developmental relationships, highlights potential consequences of “no excuses” policies and practices in schools, and presents an alternative view of learning environments which promote effective self-regulation skills in young children.",“no excuses” schools; Classroom management; Developmental science; Policy; Research; School discipline; Self-regulation; Social and emotional skills,"Bailey, Rebecca; Meland, Emily A.; Brion-Meisels, Gretchen; Jones, Stephanie M.",2019,,1,21
23,"A multiple-dosing, placebo-controlled study of budesonide inhalation suspension given once or twice daily for treatment of persistent asthma in young children and infants","Rationale. Topical antiinflammatory medications such as inhaled corticosteroids are recommended for therapy of asthma, but no formulation suitable for administration to infants and young children is available in the United States. Methods. This was a 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study comparing the efficacy and safety of four dosing regimens of budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) or placebo in 480 asthmatic infants and children (64% boys), ages 6 months to 8 years, with moderate persistent asthma. Approximately 30% of children were previously on inhaled corticosteroids that were discontinued before the study. Active treatments were comprised of BIS 0.25 mg once daily (QD), 0.25 mg twice a day (BID), 0.5 mg BID, or 1.0 mg QD. Efficacy was assessed by twice daily recording at home of asthma symptom scores and use of rescue medication, and discontinuation from the study because of worsening asthma and/or a requirement for systemic steroids. Peak flow measurements were recorded twice daily on diary and spirometry was recorded at clinic visits for those children able to perform these tests. Safety was assessed by reported adverse events and by cortisol testing (adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation) in a subset of patients. Results. Patients enrolled had an average duration of asthma of 34 months; the mean asthma symptom score was ~1.3 (scale of 0-3). All dosing regimens with BIS produced statistically significant improvement in various clinical efficacy measures for asthma control compared with placebo. The lowest dose used, 0.25 mg QD, was efficacious but with fewer efficacy parameters than seen with the other doses administered. Separation between active treatment and placebo in daytime and nighttime symptom scores were observed by week 2 of treatment for all BIS treatment regimens. A significant increase in peak flow measurement was observed in most active treatment groups compared with placebo in the subset of children able to do pulmonary function testing. All treatment groups showed numerical improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second but only the 0.5-mg BID dose was significantly different from placebo. Adverse events for the entire group and response to adrenocorticotropic hormone in a subgroup of children who underwent cortisol testing before and at the end of the treatment period were no different in budesonide-treated patients in comparison to placebo. Conclusion. Results of this study demonstrate that BIS is effective and safe for infants and young children with moderate persistent asthma in a multiple dose range, and that QD dosing is an important option to be considered by the prescribing physician.",Asthma; Budesonide; Children; Corticosteroids,"Baker, James W.; Mellon, Michael; Wald, Jeffrey; Welch, Michael; Cruz-Rivera, Mario; Walton-Bowen, Karen",1999,10.1542/peds.103.2.414,0,22
24,"Clinical results from a randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging study of pantoprazole in children aged 1 through 5 years with symptomatic histologic or erosive esophagitis","In an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of pantoprazole (0.3mg/kg [low dose (LD)], 0.6 mg/kg [medium dose (MD)], and 1.2 mg/kg [high dose (HD)]) for delayed-release oral suspension (granules) in patients 1 to 5 years with documented symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and endoscopic evidence of reflux-related erosive esophagitis (EE) or histologic esophagitis (HE) consistent with GERD. Patients with HE were randomly assigned to LD, MD, or HD, and patients with EE, to MD or HD. A daily eDiary captured 5 individual GERD symptoms. A total of 60 patients (56 HE, 4 EE) were randomized. Mean weekly GERD symptom score (WGSS, sum of weekly mean frequency scores for 5 individual GERD symptoms) for the modified intention-to-treat HE population at the final week was improved with LD (P <.001), MD (P =.063), and HD (P < 0.001) (paired t-tests). Patients with EE were healed at week 8.

25,School-related and social-emotional outcomes of providing mental health services in schools,"This study evaluated student outcomes of an expanded school mental health (ESMH) model that placed community mental health clinicians on-site in schools to identify and treat children with mental health needs. The first aim of this study was to consider school-related outcomes (suspension rates and attendance rates) for those students who received ESMH treatment (n = 159) were compared to a matched high-risk sample that did not receive such services (n = 148). Results demonstrated differences between groups over time on measures of suspensions and attendance but not academic achievement. The second aim of this study was to evaluate change in social-emotional functioning (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire Scores) over time for the treatment group. Results indicated significant improvements on several parent and teacher ratings. Despite limitations of the ESMH framework examined in this study, the overall results suggest some promising advantages for students who received ESMH services. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Intervention; Keyword: School; Mental health,"Ballard, Kristin L.; Sander, Mark A.; Klimes-Dougan, Bonnie",2014,10.1007/s10597-013-9670-y,1,24
27,Inactivation of Cryptosporidium parvum oocyst infectivity by disinfection and sterilization processes,"Background: Cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of self-limited gastroenteritis in the normal host but may cause severe disease in immunocompromised persons. Person-to-person transmission has been well documented in households, child care centers, and hospitals. Because contaminated environmental surfaces and medical devices such as endoscopes may play a role in disease transmission, we studied the susceptibility of C parvum to chemical agents commonly used for disinfection and evaluated the efficacy of sterilization processes. Methods: Seven disinfectants were studied at their use dilution using a suspension test. Antimicrobial activity was assessed with the use of a cell infectivity assay. Results: All sterilization processes tested (steam, ethylene oxide, Sterrad 100) inactivated 3 logs or greater of C parvum. The only liquid disinfectant/sterilant able to inactivate greater than 3 logs of C parvum was 6% and 7.5% hydrogen peroxide. Agents that did not completely inactivate C parvum included hydrogen peroxide at lower concentrations or exposure times, peracetic acid, sodium hypochlorite, a phenolic, a quaternary ammonium compound, 2% glutaraldehyde, and ortho-phthalaldehyde. Conclusions: Most high-level disinfectants used on endoscopes have limited efficacy against C parvum. However, the infectivity of C parvum on dry surfaces decreases rapidly. Therefore, current cleaning and high-level disinfection guidelines are adequate to prevent nosocomial transmission of C parvum by means of endoscopes.",,"Barbee, S. L.; Weber, D. J.; Sobsey, M.

28,Comparison of 2 transvaginal surgical approaches and perioperative behavioral therapy for apical vaginal prolapse: The OPTIMAL randomized trial,"IMPORTANCE: More than 300 000 surgeries are performed annually in the United States for pelvic organ prolapse. Sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF) and uterosacral ligament suspension (ULS) are commonly performed transvaginal surgeries to correct apical prolapse. Little is known about their comparative efficacy and safety, and it is unknown whether perioperative behavioral therapy with pelvic floor muscle training (BPMT) improves outcomes of prolapse surgery. OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes between (1) SSLF and ULS and (2) perioperative BPMT and usual care in women undergoing surgery for vaginal prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, 2 x 2 factorial, randomized trial of 374 women undergoing surgery to treat both apical vaginal prolapse and stress urinary incontinence was conducted between 2008 and 2013 at 9 US medical centers. Two-year follow-up rate was 84.5%. INTERVENTIONS: The surgical intervention was transvaginal surgery including midurethral sling with randomization to SSLF (n = 186) or ULS (n = 188); the behavioral intervention was randomization to receive perioperative BPMT (n = 186) or usual care (n = 188). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome for the surgical intervention (surgical success) was defined as (1) no apical descent greater than one-third into vaginal canal or anterior or posterior vaginal wall beyond the hymen (anatomic success), (2) no bothersome vaginal bulge symptoms, and (3) no re-treatment for prolapse at 2 years. For the behavioral intervention, primary outcome at 6 months was urinary symptom scores (Urinary Distress Inventory; range 0-300, higher scores worse), and primary outcomes at 2 years were prolapse symptom scores (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory; range 0-300, higher scores worse) and anatomic success. RESULTS: At 2 years, surgical group was not significantly associated with surgical success rates (ULS, 59.2% [93/157] vs SSLF, 60.5% [92/152]; unadjusted difference, -1.3%; 95% CI, -12.2% to 9.6%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6 to 1.5) or serious adverse event rates (ULS, 16.5% [31/188] vs SSLF, 16.7% [31/186]; unadjusted difference, -0.2%; 95% CI, -7.7% to 7.4%; adjusted OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.6). Perioperative BPMT was not associated with greater improvements in urinary scores at 6 months (adjusted treatment difference, -6.7; 95% CI, -19.7 to 6.2), prolapse scores at 24 months (adjusted treatment difference, -8.0; 95% CI, -22.1 to 6.1), or anatomic success at 24 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Two years after vaginal surgery for prolapse and stress urinary incontinence, neither ULS nor SSLF was significantly superior to the other for anatomic, functional, or adverse event outcomes. Perioperative BPMT did not improve urinary symptoms at 6 months or prolapse outcomes at 2 years.

29,Operations and pelvic muscle training in the management of apical support loss (OPTIMAL) trial: Design and methods,"The primary aims of this trial are: 1) to compare surgical outcomes following sacrospinous ligament fixation to uterosacral vaginal vault suspension in women undergoing vaginal surgery for apical or uterine pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence and 2) to examine the effects of a structured perioperative program consisting of behavioral techniques and pelvic floor muscle training compared to usual care. This trial is performed through the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN), which is funded by National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Subjects will be enrolled from hospitals associated with seven PFDN clinical centers across the United States. A centralized biostatistical coordinating center will oversee data collection and analysis. Two approaches will be investigated simultaneously using a 2 × 2 randomized factorial design: a surgical intervention (sacrospinous ligament fixation versus uterosacral vaginal vault suspension) and a perioperative behavioral intervention (behavioral and pelvic floor muscle training versus usual care). Surgeons have standardized essential components of each surgical procedure and have met specific standards of expertise. Providers of the behavioral intervention have undergone standardized training. Anatomic, functional, and health-related quality of life outcomes will be assessed using validated measures by researchers blinded to all randomization assignments. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed using prospectively collected data on health care costs and resource utilization. The primary surgical endpoint is a composite outcome defined by anatomic recurrence, recurrence of bothersome vaginal prolapse symptoms and/or retreatment and will be assessed 2 years after the index surgery. Endpoints for the behavioral intervention include both short-term (6-month) improvement in urinary symptoms and long-term (2-year) improvement in anatomic outcomes and prolapse symptoms.

These changes have led to increased stress in the family when children become ill. Infectious diseases are the most common reasons parents seek care for ill children, and parents want effective and convenient treatment regimens so the child can recover quickly and return to day care or school. Issues that affect parental compliance and satisfaction with antimicrobial treatment regimens include efficacy, safety, cost, convenience, and previous experience. Parents are more involved in medical decision making than ever before and often want to be included in the selection of an antibiotic for their child.

31,ADHD and gender: Are risks and sequela of ADHD the same for boys and girls?,"Background: Research comparing treatment-referred boys and girls with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has yielded equivocal results. Contradictory findings may be associated with differential referral practices or unexplored interactions of gender with ADHD subtypes. Method: We examined possible gender differences in ADHD and its subtypes among children aged 4 to 17 in a representative community sample (N = 1896) in Puerto Rico. Caretakers provided information through the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (version IV) and a battery of impairment, family relations, child problems, comorbidity and treatment measures. Results: ADHD was 2.3 times more common in boys than girls, but with one exception there was little evidence that the patterns of associations of ADHD with correlates were different for boys and girls. The exception was school suspension, which was more common among ADHD boys than girls. Additional gender interactions were found when ADHD subtypes were considered. Among those with combined type (n = 50), boys were more likely to be comorbid with mood disorders than girls. For those with the inattentive type (n = 47), girls were more likely to be comorbid with anxiety disorders than boys. Conclusions: Our findings lend cross-cultural generalizability to recent reports that gender does not interact with correlates for ADHD overall, but that it may play a role in subtypes. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.",ADHD subtypes; Attention deficit/hyperactivity impulsivity disorder; Gender differences; Latino/Hispanics,"Bauermeister, José J.; Shrout, Patrick E.; Chávez, Ligia; Rubio-Stipec, Maritza; Ramírez, Rafael; Padilla, Lymaries; Anderson, Adrianne; García, Pedro; Canino, Glorisa",2007,10.1111/j.1469-7610.2007.01750.x,1,29
32,Behaviour of laboratory mice is altered by light pollution within the housing environment,"Environmental light-dark cycles play an important role in behavioural and physiological processes. It is essential that laboratory vivaria be designed to properly control the light conditions in which laboratory mice are housed; however, this is not universally the case. Some laboratory vivarium doors are designed with windows, which allow light from the hallways to leak into the housing space during the rodents' dark phase. Personnel entering and exiting the housing space during the dark phase can also create excessive light leak from brightly illuminated hallways. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that exposure to dim light at night, as commonly experienced in many laboratory rodent housing spaces, alters mouse (Mus musculus) behaviour. We specifically analysed patterns of locomotor activity, anxiety- and depressive-like responses. Exposure to dim (5 lux) light at night altered home-cage locomotor activity and increased anxiety and some depressive responses among laboratory mice. These results suggest that light conditions can alter mouse behaviour and potentially influence experimental outcomes. Increased care should be taken to properly control light-dark conditions for laboratory animals. © 2013 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.",Animal welfare; Anxiety; Behaviour; Circadian; Depression; Mouse,"Bedrosian, T.

33,Balloon expulsion test as a screen for outlet obstruction in children with chronic constipation,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic constipation (CC) is a common problem in pediatrics and is often the result of obstructed defecation. The aim of the present study was to study the feasibility and efficacy of the balloon expulsion test (BET) in the diagnosis and management of children with CC. METHODS: Retrospective study comparing BET and high-resolution anorectal manometry (ARM). The BET was done together with ARM in 29 children, ages 8 to 19 years, with CC. For BET, a 60-mL balloon was used. Passage of balloon in 1 minute or less was considered normal. RESULTS: Fifteen of the 29 children had a normal BET. Of these, 14 also had an ARM, all of which were normal (except for 2 cases with a hypertonic baseline anal sphincter). Thus 12 of 14 with BET and ARM were normal on both (correlation between the tests 86%). Of the 14 children that failed BET, 10 had distal abnormalities by ARM, contrast studies, EMG, or assessment by a pelvic physical therapist. All of the patients with a nonrelaxing sphincter or outlet obstruction were treated with laxatives, anal sphicter Botox, and/or pelvic physical therapy and biofeedback. In follow-up of at least 3 months, all of the patients with a failed BET were improved. CONCLUSIONS: We found a high correlation between a normal ARM and BET. If the BET is abnormal and the ARM does not identify a cause for the distal obstruction, additional studies may be needed, including contrast enema, defecography, or electromyography. BET appears to be a safe, reliable, and useful test in the evaluation and management of CC in children.

34,The care and education of troubled children.,"Discusses how changes in legislation by the British Education, Health, and Social Services Department are having a damaging effect on services for emotionally and behaviorally disturbed children. Data show that school expulsions have increased. While this may be due in part to a real increase in emotionally disordered students, there is also the consensus that tolerance in schools for difficult and disturbed children has dropped sharply. There is also a decline in support services for these children. The stigma against residential schools for emotionally disturbed children is explored, and the need for such placements is emphasized.

35,"Safety and efficacy of olesoxime in patients with type 2 or non-ambulatory type 3 spinal muscular atrophy: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial","Background Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a progressive motor neuron disease causing loss of motor function and reduced life expectancy, for which limited treatment is available. We investigated the safety and efficacy of olesoxime in patients with type 2 or non-ambulatory type 3 SMA. Methods This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study was done in 22 neuromuscular care centres in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, and the UK. Safety and efficacy of olesoxime were assessed in patients aged 3–25 years with genetically confirmed type 2 or non-ambulatory type 3 SMA. A centralised, computerised randomisation process allocated patients (2:1 with stratification by SMA type and centre) to receive olesoxime (10 mg/kg per day) in an oral liquid suspension or placebo for 24 months. Patients, investigators assessing outcomes, and sponsor study personnel were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline compared with 24 months between the two treatment groups in functional domains 1 and 2 of the Motor Function Measure (MFM D1 + D2) assessed in the full analysis population. A shorter, 20-item version of the MFM, which was specifically adapted for young children, was used to assess patients younger than 6 years. Safety was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01302600. Findings The trial was done between Nov 18, 2010, and Oct 9, 2013. Of 198 patients screened, 165 were randomly assigned to olesoxime (n=108) or placebo (n=57). Five patients in the olesoxime group were not included in the primary outcome analysis because of an absence of post-baseline assessments. The change from baseline to month 24 on the primary outcome measure was 0·18 for olesoxime and −1·82 for placebo (treatment difference 2·00 points, 96% CI −0·25 to 4·25, p=0·0676). Olesoxime seemed to be safe and generally well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. The most frequent adverse events in the olesoxime group were pyrexia (n=34), cough (n=32), nasopharyngitis (n=25), and vomiting (n=25). There were two patient deaths (one in each group), but these were not deemed to be related to the study treatment. Interpretation Olesoxime was safe at the doses studied, for the duration of the trial. Although the primary endpoint was not met, secondary endpoints and sensitivity analyses suggest that olesoxime might maintain motor function in patients with type 2 or type 3 SMA over a period of 24 months. Based on these results, olesoxime might provide meaningful clinical benefits for patients with SMA and, given its mode of action, might be used in combination with other drugs targeting other mechanisms of disease, although additional evidence is needed.

36,The Costly Consequences of not Being Socially and Behaviorally Ready to Learn by Kindergarten in Baltimore City,"Social, emotional, and behavioral skills are foundational to learning and long-term success. However, poverty and exposure to adverse childhood experiences reduce the chances of children entering kindergarten socially-behaviorally ready to learn. This study examined the unique impact of 5-year-old children (N = 11,412) entering kindergarten not socially-behaviorally ready on three costly school outcomes by fourth grade in Baltimore City Public Schools: being retained in grade, receiving services and supports through an IEP or 504 plan, and being suspended/expelled. Controlling for all other types of school readiness, students not identified as socially-behaviorally ready for kindergarten were more likely to experience all three school outcomes. Findings underscore the importance of early prevention and intervention strategies targeting parents and social-behavioral readiness skills during the first 5 years of life.","Grade retention; Poverty; Social, emotional, and behavioral readiness; Special education services; Suspension","Bettencourt, Amie F.; Gross, Deborah; Ho, Grace; Perrin, Nancy",2018,,1,34

Personal interviews conducted with a purposive sample of fifty-three mothers reaching the end of active mothering were analyzed by a constant comparison process. After analyses of the interviews were completed, four major themes emerged from the data related to the leisure of mothers in this sample. These four themes related to: (a) the way in which leisure was described by the women as a focus on self, (b) a concept of ''full circle'' leisure that was similar to a suspension of career while the children were dependent, (c) the limitations imposed on mothers due to socialized gender roles, and (d) the dichotomous influence of the ethic of care on the women's leisure.",,"Bialeschki, M.

39,Feasibility of a hospital outpatient day procedure for medication abortion at 13–18 weeks gestation: Findings from Nepal,"Objectives: To evaluate the safety, acceptability and feasibility of a one-day outpatient medication abortion service at gestations 13–18 weeks. Study design: Open-label prospective study in which participants received mifepristone 200 mg orally to swallow at home or at the clinic followed 24 h later by misoprostol 400 mcg buccally. They presented to the outpatient clinic 24–48 h after mifepristone for misoprostol 400 mcg buccally every three hours (no maximum dose). The primary outcome was successful abortion without transfer to overnight inpatient care. Secondary outcomes included time to abortion from initial misoprostol dose, safety, additional interventions and side effects. Results: We enrolled 230 women from December 2017 to November 2018. Approximately nine of ten (n = 206, 89.6%) achieved a successful abortion without transfer to overnight care. Twenty-four were transferred to overnight inpatient care; of these 18 were to manage a complication, five for incomplete abortion and two by choice. Among these 24, three women experienced an SAE. The median time to successful abortion from time of the first misoprostol dose was 7.2 h (range: 0.75–92.3), with an average of three misoprostol doses. Most participants expelled the fetus and the placenta at or around the same time; median time between fetal and placental expulsion was 15 minutes (range: 0–4.5 h). Fifteen participants (6.6%) received more than five misoprostol doses and were transferred to inpatient care. Administration of more than five doses of misoprostol was associated with nulliparity. Provision of antibiotics (27.9%, n = 64), manual removal of placenta (15.3%, n = 35), uterotonics (4.4%, n = 10) and surgical interventions (4.4%, n = 10) were also reported. About one in four participants experienced nausea, vomiting and chills; fever was infrequent (2.5%, n = 5). Conclusions: For gestations 13–18 weeks, an outpatient day process for medication abortion is safe, effective and feasible. Implications: Medication abortion in 13 – 18 weeks need not be limited to inpatient care; nine of ten cases can be managed as an outpatient day service.",Medical abortion; Medication abortion; Mifepristone; Misoprostol; Second trimester; Task-sharing,"Blum, Jennifer; Karki, Chanda; Tamang, Anand; Shochet, Tara; Shrestha, Achala; Tuladhar, Heera; Karki, Aruna; Sharma, Jyotsna; Abbas, Dina F.; Dragoman, Monica; Winikoff, Beverly",2019,10.1016/j.contraception.2019.08.007,0,36
40,Use of the token economy system to intervene on a school‐wide level,"Many writers have suggested that professionals dealing with psychological problems in school settings need to consider procedures for consulting on a system level, rather than on an individual or a group level. In this report, a token economy system was implemented for all 459 students in a K‐6 elementary school. Managing an intervention program at the system level required comprehensive procedures for staff training and program modification. The results showed a major decrease in classroom disruptions and a decrease in negative teacher interactions during the token economy system compared with baseline data. Data analysis the following summer on system‐wide variables demonstrated that the number of suspended students and number of days of suspension decreased, that the rate of gain on achievement tests in reading and mathematics increased compared with the yearly rates suggested by test scores the previous year, and that the teacher turnover rate decreased. Several variables considered necessary for the effective implementation of the program were discussed. Copyright © 1978 Verlag Chemie, GmbH",,"Boegli, R.

41,Environmental Scan of Sleep Health in Early Childhood Programs,"Objective: To ascertain how sleep health knowledge is translated to early care and education (ECE) programs, using a multi-component environmental scan. Methods: A website scan identified organizations’ sleep content re: recommended practices, developmental effects, and “actionable” ratings (0–2). ECE staff surveys assessed preparedness, practices, and beliefs about addressing sleep health and sleep problems in ECE programs. Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders from the ECE, pediatric and sleep communities assessed awareness, priorities, and practices at their organizations. Results: Of 15 websites scanned, half lacked sleep content on links to development, optimal duration, or scientific background. ECE staff (n = 31) were comfortable speaking to parents about healthy sleep, and with incorporating sleep education and guidance into ECE. Stakeholders (n = 15) rated healthy sleep as a high relevance, but lower priority issue. Within ECE settings stakeholders reported that knowledge about specific links to health and development was poor and that sleep health was often obscured by “safe sleep” issues. Their recommendations included: linking sleep health to “hot topics” such as obesity or preschool suspensions and expulsions, integrating it with the teaching of routines, and raising public awareness. Conclusion: Despite understanding that healthy sleep promotes school readiness, there is insufficiently specific, actionable information in ECE training, programs, or policies. Findings suggest a need for an awareness campaign with clear, actionable messaging, dissemination of turnkey materials, and integration with policy and professional training systems.

43,Effects of breeding configuration on maternal and weanling behavior in laboratory mice,"Although numerous studies have evaluated the effect of housing density on the wellbeing of laboratory mice, little is known about the effect of breeding configuration on mouse behavior. The 8th edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals lists the recommended minimal floor area per animal for a female mouse and her litter as 51 in.2 We sought to determine the effects of pair, trio, and harem breeding configurations on the maternal and weanling behavior of C57BL/6J (B6) and 129S6/SvEvTac (129) mice on the basis of nest scores and performance in pup retrieval tests, open-field test (OFT), elevated plus maze, and tail suspension test; we concurrently evaluated cage microenvironment, reproductive indices, and anatomic and clinical pathology. Harem breeding configurations enhanced B6 maternal behaviors as evidenced by significantly shorter pup retrieval times. Trio- and harem-raised B6 weanlings showed increased exploratory behaviors, as evidenced by greater time spent in the center of the OFT, when compared with pair-raised B6 mice. Conversely, breeding configuration did not alter pup retrieval times for 129 mice, and on the day of weaning trio- and harem-raised 129 mice demonstrated increased anxiety-like behavior, as evidenced by greater time spent in the periphery of the OFT, when compared with pair-raised counterparts. Behavioral differences were not noted on subsequent days for either strain. Trio- and harem-raised B6 and 129 weanling mice had significantly higher weaning weights than weanlings raised in a pair breeding configuration. Trio and harem breeding in a standard 67-in.2 shoebox cage did not detrimentally affect the evaluated welfare parameters in either C57BL/6J or 129S6/SvEvTac mice.",,"Braden, Gillian C.; Rasmussen, Skye; Monette, Sebastien; Tolwani, Ravi J.",2017,,0,39

45,Examining the effects of schoolwide positive behavioral interventions and supports on student outcomes: Results from a randomized controlled effectiveness trial in elementary schools,"Schoolwide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS) is a universal, schoolwide prevention strategy that is currently implemented in over 9,000 schools across the nation to reduce disruptive behavior problems through the application of behavioral, social learning, and organizational behavioral principles. SWPBIS aims to alter school environments by creating improved systems and procedures that promote positive change in student behavior by targeting staff behaviors. This study uses data from a 5-year longitudinal randomized controlled effectiveness trial of SWPBIS conducted in 37 elementary schools to examine the impact of training in SWPBIS on implementation fidelity as well as student suspensions, office discipline referrals, and academic achievement. School-level longitudinal analyses indicated that the schools trained in SWPBIS implemented the model with high fidelity and experienced significant reductions in student suspensions and office discipline referrals. © 2010 Hammill Institute on Disabilities.",Achievement; Effectiveness research; Office discipline referrals; Randomized controlled trial; Schoolwide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports; Suspensions,"Bradshaw, Catherine P.; Mitchell, Mary M.; Leaf, Philip J.",2010,10.1177/1098300709334798,0,41
46,A social disorganization perspective on bullying-related attitudes and behaviors: The influence of school context,"Social disorganization theory suggests that certain school-level indictors of disorder may be important predictors of bullying-related attitudes and behaviors. Multilevel analyses were conducted on bullying-related attitudes and experiences among 22,178 students in 95 elementary and middle schools. The intraclass correlation coefficients indicated that 0.6-2% of the variance in victimization, 5-10% of the variance in retaliatory attitudes, 5-6% of the variance in perceptions of safety, and 0.9% of the variance in perpetration of bullying was associated with the clustering of students within schools. Although the specific associations varied somewhat for elementary schools as compared to middle schools, the hierarchical linear modeling analyses generally suggested that school-level indicators of disorder (e.g., student-teacher ratio, concentration of student poverty, suspension rate, and student mobility) were significant predictors of bullying-related attitudes and experiences. Student-level characteristics (i.e., sex, ethnicity, status in school) were also relevant to students' retaliatory attitudes, perceptions of safety, and involvement in bullying. Implications for school-based research and violence prevention are provided. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Bullying; Multilevel analysis; School climate; School context; Social disorganization theory; Youth violence,"Bradshaw, Catherine P.; Sawyer, Anne L.; O'Brennan, Lindsey M.",2009,10.1007/s10464-009-9240-1,0,42
47,Effects of school-wide positive behavioral interventions and supports on child behavior problems,"OBJECTIVE: School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS) is a universal prevention strategy currently implemented in >16 000 schools across the United States. SWPBIS intends to reduce students ' behavior problems by altering staff behaviors and developing systems and supports to meet children's behavioral needs. The current study reports intervention effects on child behaviors and adjustment from an effectiveness trial of SWPBIS. METHODS: The sample of 12 344 elementary school children was 52.9% male, 45.1% African American, and 46.1% Caucasian. Approximately 49% received free or reduced-priced meals, and 12.9% received special education services at baseline. The trial used a group randomized controlled effectiveness design implemented in 37 elementary schools. Multilevel analyses were conducted on teachers' ratings of children's behavior problems, concentration problems, social-emotional functioning, prosocial behavior, office discipline referrals, and suspensions at 5 time points over the course of 4 school years. RESULTS: The multilevel results indicated significant effects of SWPBIS on children's behavior problems, concentration problems, social-emotional functioning, and prosocial behavior. Children in SWPBIS schools also were 33% less likely to receive an office discipline referral than those in the comparison schools. The effects tended to be strongest among children who were first exposed to SWPBIS in kindergarten. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support for the hypothesized reduction in behavior problems and improvements in prosocial behavior and effective emotion regulation after training in SWPBIS. The SWPBIS framework appears to be a promising approach for reducing problems and promoting adjustment among elementary school children.

49,"Prospective, randomized comparison of lansoprazole suspension, and intermittent intravenous famotidine on gastric ph and acid production in critically ill neurosurgical patients","Background: There is a paucity of studies comparing stress ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) agents in high-risk neurosurgical patients. Methods: In this prospective, randomized study, critically ill neurosurgical patients received lansoprazole 30 mg suspension via NG/NJ tube daily or famotidine 20 mg IV q12 h for SUP. Gastric pH and residual volumes were recorded for 3 days and adverse events for 7 days after admission. Results: There were 51 patients randomized to lansoprazole (n = 28) or famotidine (n = 23) who received SUP for ≥3 days. All patients had at least two risk factors for SRMD, and 75% had a baseline GCS < 9. On day 1 of therapy, more famotidine patients had a gastric pH ≥ 4 at least 80% of the time as compared to lansoprazole patients (74 vs. 36%, P = 0.01, respectively); however, there was no difference on days 2 and 3. Enteral feedings on day 1 predicted a pH ≥ 4 (P = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the percentages of time gastric residual volumes <28 ml (P = NS). Heme-positive aspirates were present in 18-39% of patients (P = NS); one patient receiving famotidine met the criteria for overt bleeding. Thrombocytopenia occurred in 17% in the famotidine group and 4% in the lansoprazole group (P = NS). Conclusions: Neurosurgery ICU patients receiving famotidine for SUP achieved a gastric pH ≥ 4 more often than lansoprazole-treated patients, but only on day 1 of the 3-day study period. Both agents were equally effective in reducing gastric acid production. There was no difference in the incidence of mucosal damage and thrombocytopenia. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Famotidine; Gastric pH; Lansoprazole; Neurosurgical; Prophylaxis; Stress ulcer,"Brophy, Gretchen M.; Brackbill, Marcia L.; Bidwell, Katherine L.; Brophy, Donald F.",2010,10.1007/s12028-010-9397-3,0,45
50,The impact of school mental health services on out-of-school suspension rates,"The current study investigated whether the presence of school-based mental health clinicians in an urban school district was associated with reduced out-of-school suspension rates. Forty one elementary schools with expanded school mental health (ESMH) programs were compared to 41 schools without ESMH programs. Correlational analyses revealed associations between suspension outcomes and several school-level demographic variables including school attendance rate, percent of students in poverty, and percent of nonwhite students in the school. After controlling for these variables, however, results of stepwise linear regressions demonstrated no significant differences between ESMH and non-ESMH schools on suspension outcomes. Results of the current study suggest that the presence of ESMH clinicians will not necessarily impact suspension rates in an elementary school. Targeted and well-implemented approaches to address behaviors that lead to suspension, or school- and system-level policies to provide alternatives to suspensions, will likely be a better route to achieving this outcome. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.",Behaviors; Expanded school mental health; Suspension,"Bruns, Eric J.; Moore, Elizabeth; Stephan, Sharon Hoover; Pruitt, David; Weist, Mark D.",2005,10.1007/s10964-005-1333-z,0,46
51,Prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia using predictive alarm algorithms and insulin pump suspension,"OBJECTIVE - The aim of this study was to develop a partial closed-loop system to safely prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia by suspending insulin delivery when hypoglycemia is predicted in type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Forty subjects with type 1 diabetes (age range 12-39 years) were studied overnight in the hospital. For the first 14 subjects, hypoglycemia (<60 mg/dl) was induced by gradually increasing the basal insulin infusion rate (without the use of pump shutoff algorithms). During the subsequent 26 patient studies, pump shutoff occurred when either three of five (n = 10) or two of five (n = 16) algorithms predicted hypoglycemia based on the glucose levels measured with the FreeStyle Navigator (Abbott Diabetes Care). RESULTS - The standardized protocol induced hypoglycemia on 13 (93%) of the 14 nights. With use of a voting scheme that required three algorithms to trigger insulin pump suspension, nocturnal hypoglycemia was prevented during 6 (60%) of 10 nights. When the voting scheme was changed to require only two algorithms to predict hypoglycemia to trigger pump suspension, hypoglycemia was prevented during 12 (75%) of 16 nights. In the latter study, there were 25 predictions of hypoglycemia because some subjects had multiple hypoglycemic events during a night, and hypoglycemia was prevented for 84% of these events. CONCLUSIONS - Using algorithms to shut off the insulin pump when hypoglycemia is predicted, it is possible to prevent hypoglycemia on 75% of nights (84% of events) when it would otherwise be predicted to occur. © 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"Buckingham, Bruce; Chase, H.

53,Evaluation of Opioid Prescriptions After Urogynecologic Surgery Within a Large Health Care Organization: How Much Are We Prescribing?,"Objectives Data regarding postoperative opioid prescriptions for patients undergoing urogynecologic surgery are sparse. Our objective was to quantify surgeon prescribing patterns for patients undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse or stress urinary incontinence. Methods Patients who underwent surgery for pelvic organ prolapse or SUI within a large health care maintenance organization were identified by procedural codes within the electronic medical record. Medical records were reviewed for demographic and clinical data. Our primary objective was to describe initial postoperative morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dosages for patients undergoing various urogynecologic surgeries. Secondary objectives were to evaluate rates of postoperative non-opioid analgesic prescriptions, presence of additional postoperative opioid prescriptions within 90 days of surgery, and to characterize prescribing patterns of surgeons from different specialties. Results We evaluated 855 patients undergoing 7 urogynecologic surgeries. There was wide variation in the quantity of MME prescribed to patients undergoing different urogynecologic surgeries, and the mean MME ranged from 137.6 mg after a colpocleisis to 214.1 mg after a laparoscopic uterosacral ligament suspension. Less than two thirds of patients received a postoperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prescription, and rates of NSAID prescriptions varied widely between surgeons from different specialties. Thirty-nine (4.6%) patients received an additional postoperative opioid prescription specifically for the indication of persistent postoperative pain. Conclusions There is wide variation in the range of MME prescribed postoperatively to patients undergoing common urogynecologic surgeries. Less than two thirds of patients received a postoperative NSAID prescription, which was found to be independently associated with a higher postoperative opioid prescription dose.",dosage; opioid; opioid refill; postoperative prescription; urogynecologic surgery,"Buono, Kristen; Brueseke, Taylor; Wu, Jun; Whitcomb, Emily",2019,10.1097/SPV.0000000000000657,0,49
54,Rapid inpatient behavioral treatment for choking phobia in children,"Six children with acquired choking phobia who failed outpatient intervention were treated in a rapid, behaviorally based inpatient program that integrated in vivo exposure with contingency management. Motivation to eat feared foods was increased via the manipulation of appetite and hospital privileges (e.g., visits, TV). Children were required to eat small quantities of feared food to receive privileges, and failure to meet these requirements resulted in privilege suspension. Elimination of the choking phobia occurred within 3 days. This approach is appropriate for cases in which outpatient treatment fails, in which parents have made legitimate attempts at home-based treatment, or in which the child's medical condition warrants it.",,"Burklow, Kathleen A.; Linscheid, Thomas",2004,10.1207/s15326888chc3302_1,0,50

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - During the initiation phase of the DURABLE trial, patients were randomized to a twice-daily lispro mix 75/25 (LM75/25; 75% lispro protamine suspension, 25% lispro) (n = 1,045) or daily glargine (GL) (n = 1,046) with continuation of prestudy oral antihyperglycemic drugs. RESULTS - Baseline A1C was similar (LM75/25: 9.1 ± 1.3%; GL: 9.0 ± 1.2%; P = 0.414). At 24 weeks, LM75/25 patients had lower A1C than GL patients (7.2 ± 1.1 vs. 7.3 ± 1.1%, P = 0.005), greater A1C reduction (-1.8 ± 1.3 vs. -1.7 ± 1.3%, P = 0.005), and higher percentage reaching A1C target <7.0% (47.5 vs. 40.3%, P < 0.001). LM75/25 was associated with higher insulin dose (0.47 ± 0.23 vs. 0.40 ± 0.23 units·kg-1 ·day-1, P < 0.001) and more weight gain (3.6 ± 4.0 vs. 2.5 ± 4.0 kg, P < 0.0001). LM75/25 patients had a higher overall hypoglycemia rate than GL patients (28.0 ± 41.6 vs. 23.1 ± 40.7 episodes·pt -1·year-1, P = 0.007) but lower nocturnal hypoglycemia rate (8.9 ± 19.3 vs. 11.4 ± 25.3 episodes· pt-1·year-1, P = 0.009). Severe hypoglycemia rates were low in both groups (LM75/25: 0.10 ± 1.6 vs. GL: 0.03 ± 0.3 episodes·pt-1·year-1, P = 0.167). CONCLUSIONS - Compared with GL, LM75/25 resulted in slightly lower A1C at 24 weeks and a moderately higher percentage reaching A1C target <7.0%. Patients receiving LM75/25 experienced more weight gain and higher rates of overall hypoglycemia but lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia.

56,Randomized controlled trial of postoperative belladonna and opium rectal suppositories in vaginal surgery,"Background After vaginal surgery, oral and parenteral narcotics are used commonly for pain relief, and their use may exacerbate the incidence of sedation, nausea, and vomiting, which ultimately delays convalescence. Previous studies have demonstrated that rectal analgesia after surgery results in lower pain scores and less intravenous morphine consumption. Belladonna and opium rectal suppositories may be used to relieve pain and minimize side effects; however, their efficacy has not been confirmed. Objective We aimed to evaluate the use of belladonna and opium suppositories for pain reduction in vaginal surgery. Materials and Methods A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that used belladonna and opium suppositories after inpatient or outpatient vaginal surgery was conducted. Vaginal surgery was defined as (1) vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension or (2) posthysterectomy prolapse repair that included uterosacral ligament suspension and/or colporrhaphy. Belladonna and opium 16A (16.2/60 mg) or placebo suppositories were administered rectally immediately after surgery and every 8 hours for a total of 3 doses. Patient-reported pain data were collected with the use of a visual analog scale (at 2, 4, 12, and 20 hours postoperatively. Opiate use was measured and converted into parenteral morphine equivalents. The primary outcome was pain, and secondary outcomes included pain medication, antiemetic medication, and a quality of recovery questionnaire. Adverse effects were surveyed at 24 hours and 7 days. Concomitant procedures for urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse did not preclude enrollment. Results Ninety women were randomly assigned consecutively at a single institution under the care of a fellowship-trained surgeon group. Demographics did not differ among the groups with mean age of 55 years, procedure time of 97 minutes, and prolapse at 51%. Postoperative pain scores were equivalent among both groups at each time interval. The belladonna and opium group used a mean of 57 mg morphine compared with 66 mg for placebo (P=.43) in 24 hours. Patient satisfaction with recovery was similar (P=.59). Antiemetic and ketorolac use were comparable among groups. Subgroup analyses of patients with prolapse and patients <50 years old did not reveal differences in pain scores. The use of belladonna and opium suppositories was uncomplicated, and adverse effects, which included constipation and urinary retention, were similar among groups. Conclusion Belladonna and opium suppositories are safe for use after vaginal surgery. Belladonna and opium suppositories did not reveal lower pain or substantially lower narcotic use. Further investigation may be warranted to identify a population that may benefit optimally from belladonna and opium use.",belladonna; opium; suppository,"Butler, Kristina; Yi, John; Wasson, Megan; Klauschie, Jennifer; Ryan, Debra; Hentz, Joseph; Cornella, Jeffrey; Magtibay, Paul; Kho, Roseanne",2017,10.1016/j.ajog.2016.12.032,0,52
57,Toward Predicting Youth Resistance to Internet Risk Prevention Strategies,"Strategies to protect youth from potentially problematic online experiences may be met with considerable resistance as young people may not be ready or willing to accept such interventions. This study seeks to identify specific Internet risk prevention strategies that are likely to be met with resistance from children and adolescents. It aims to advance the ability to predict when parents and their children will disagree on appropriate strategies for their household. A United States national sample of 456 parents indicated their level of support for a wide range of Internet risk prevention strategies. Their children, ranging from 10-16 years of age, also reported their own attitudes toward each strategy. Strategies resulting in the least disagreement from children include those that empower youth to protect themselves, as well as legal consequences or suspension from school for people who misbehave online. Analysis predicting disagreement between parents and their children revealed that certain characteristics of the relationship, particularly communicative difficulty and parenting style, factor into the problem.

58,Primary packaging considerations in developing medicines for children: Oral liquid and powder for constitution,"The packaging presentation of oral liquid pediatric medicines is a critical step in maintaining chemical and physical stability, compliance, adherence, and proper handling by the target patient population, guardians, caregivers, and health-care professionals. The common packaging presentations for commercial oral liquid pediatric drug products are glass bottle, plastic bottle, sachet, and stick pack configurations. The type of pack presentation selected is driven by the quality target product profile (QTPP) that is designed around the physicochemical properties of the drug substance and the desired drug product suitability for the target population. The QTPP defines the intended use of the drug product, drug product quality criteria, dose strength, dosage form, container closure system, storage conditions, stability criteria, dosing device, shelf life, and attributes affecting the pharmacokinetic characteristics. Oral liquid pediatric formulations are typically prepared from a powder that is constituted at the time of use as a suspension or a solution for single or multiple use depending on the stability of the constituted formulation. Active ingredients with high aqueous solubility can be developed as a powder for oral solution and presented in a bottle for multiple use product and a stick pack, packet, or sachet for single-use product. Active ingredients with low aqueous solubility can be developed as a powder for oral suspension and presented in a bottle for multiple use product and a stick pack or sachet for single-use product. A secondary package may be used in cases where the primary pack failed to provide adequate protection against light degradation. This work will help formulation scientists select the most appropriate pack presentation in the early stages of pediatric clinical development.",Chemical stability; Degradation products; Moisture sorption; Pediatric; Physical stability; Physicochemical properties; Solubility,"Campbell, Gossett A.; Vallejo, Erick",2015,10.1002/jps.24223,0,54
59,"Differential antidepressant-like response to lithium treatment between mouse strains: Effects of sex, maternal care, and mixed genetic background","Background: Lithium is a mood stabilizer with both antidepressant and antimanic properties, however its mechanism of action is unclear. Identifying the genetic factors that influence lithium's therapeutic actions will be an important step to assist in identifying such mechanisms. We previously reported that lithium treatment of male mice has antidepressant-like effects in the C57BL/6J strain but that such effects were absent in the BALB/cJ strain. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the roles of both genetic and non-genetic factors such as sex and non-shared environmental conditions that may mediate differential behavioral responses to lithium. Methods: Mice were treated with lithium for 10 days and then tested in the forced swim test followed by lithium discontinuation and retesting to assess effects of lithium withdrawal. We also assessed effects of sex and cross-fostering on lithium response between the C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ strains, and antidepressant-like effects of lithium in the hybrid CB6F1/J strain that is derived from C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ parental strains. Results: Neither sex nor maternal care significantly influenced the differential antidepressant-like response to lithium. Withdrawal from lithium treatment reversed antidepressant-like effects in the C57BL/6J strain but had no effects in BALB/cJ mice. Lithium treatment did not result in antidepressant-like effects in the CB6F1/J strain. Conclusions: Genetic factors are likely primarily responsible for differential antidepressant-like effects of lithium in the C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ strains. Future studies identifying such genetic factors may help to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of lithium's therapeutic actions. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bipolar disorder; Depression; Forced swim test; Inbred strains; Lithium; Maternal care; Mice,"Can, Adem; Piantadosi, Sean C.; Gould, Todd D.",2013,10.1007/s00213-013-3045-5,0,55
60,Co-occurrence of conduct problems and depressive symptoms in early adolescent boys: III. Prediction to young-adult adjustment,"The prediction of young-adult adjustment from early adolescent conduct problems and depressive symptoms was examined for an at-risk sample of approximately 200 males. Conduct problems and depressive symptoms were expected to show stability to young adulthood. It was predicted that early adolescent conduct problems would be associated with a broad range of adjustment problems in young adulthood due to cumulative adjustment failures. Early adolescent depressive symptoms were expected particularly to predict poor relationships with parents and peers. Additive and interactive effects of the two predictors were examined. Conduct problems and depressive symptoms showed significant stability to young adulthood. Conduct problems were associated with a broad range of adjustment problems including continuing problems in peer associations, substance use, self-esteem, relationships with parents, and new problems in noncompletion of education, unemployment, driver's license suspensions, and causing pregnancies. Depressive symptoms predicted particularly to problems in social relationships. Higher levels of both conduct problems and depressive symptoms in early adolescence did not predict to increased difficulties for any one outcome over either problem alone, either due to main or interaction effects. Such co-occurrence, however, did result in problem outcomes in multiple areas, thus, the poorest adjustment overall.",,"Capaldi, Deborah M.; Stoolmiller, Mike",1999,10.1017/S0954579499001959,0,56
61,The Tooth Fairy: Psychological Issues Related to Baby Tooth Loss and Mythological Working Through,"In this article, we focus on the Tooth Fairy legend that emerged in the United States and Britain in the nineteenth century and on the bedtime rituals associated with it. Drawing on various children's books, we present this legend and these rituals as among the many legends and rituals found around the world for dealing with the loss of baby teeth in early childhood. Our particular concern is with some of the psychological issues that are associated with the development of teeth in the second stage of infancy. We also draw on the clinical observations of Erik H. Erikson, as we focus especially on the role that teeth play in the loss of the original unity between the infant and its mother. We take note of Erikson's suggestion that this is, ontogenetically speaking, the experience that is portrayed in the biblical story of the Fall and expulsion from the Garden in Genesis 3. We view the rituals associated with the Tooth Fairy legend as a mythological means of enabling children to address and work through these psychological issues. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Baby teeth; Children's books; El Ratón Pérez; Erik H.

62,Representing nursing knowledge on maternal and neonatal health: A study on the cultural suitability of ICNP®,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the representation of knowledge among nurses and midwives in a maternal and obstetrics setting, in a hospital in northern Portugal. The research had two main objectives: to contribute to the identification and definition of concepts that represent nursing knowledge in obstetrics and to participate in the validation of the International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP)®. Methods: Using a qualitative approach, the study was designed in three phases. The first phase aimed to identify the terms and expressions used by nurses in nursing documentation and oral report, using document analysis, observation and interview as data collection methods. The second phase intended to determine which terms and expressions corresponded to ICNP® concepts. The third phase aimed to analyse the definition of some ICNP® concepts. In both the second and third phases, a consensus approach was used based on the Delphi Technique. ICNP® concepts were identified from the words and expressions used by nurses and midwives to describe their practice.Results: The results of this study suggested modifications on some ICNP® concept definitions, namely burping, bonding, mother-child attachment, infant sucking, false labour pain, aborting, and uterine contraction; and the inclusion of specific characteristics in others, i.e. uterine expulsion, breast engorgement, colic, and hunger. New ICNP® concepts were also suggested, specifically mother-foetal attachment, uterine contraction after labour, pain after labour and foetal well-being.Conclusion: The study confirmed that ICNP® is an important instrument to identify the concepts needed to describe mother and child needs during the perinatal period. © 2010 The Authors.

63,Implementing a statewide early childhood mental health consultation approach to preventing childcare expulsion,"State- and local-level mental health administrators and practitioners can work collaboratively to provide effective early childhood mental health consultation (ECMHC) services that address the growing need in communities to promote healthy socioemotional functioning in infants and young children and prevent longer term mental health challenges. This article describes one state's model of ECMHC, the Child Care Expulsion Prevention Program (CCEP), as well as preliminary evaluation findings on consultants' fidelity to the developed approach to service within 31 counties in Michigan. The CCEP approach is flexible, yet adheres to six cornerstones which are essential to effectively and consistently carrying out services across local projects, including the provision of relationship-based programmatic and child/family-centered consultation, hiring and supporting high-quality consultants through professional development and reflective supervision, ongoing provision of state-level technical assistance, use of evidence-based practices, and collaboration with other early childhood service providers. In addition to the overview of CCEP's approach and effectiveness, lessons learned are provided to guide those engaged in policy development, practice, and applied research pertaining to ECMHC. © 2012 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.",,"Carlson, John S.; Mackrain, Mary A.; van Egeren, Laurie A.; Brophy-Herb, Holly; Kirk, Rosalind H.; Marciniak, Deb; Falvay, Sheri; Zheng, Yan; Bender, Stacy L.; Tableman, Betty",2012,10.1002/imhj.21336,1,59
64,A preliminary empirical evaluation of KooLKIDS: A school-based program to reduce early onset antisocial behaviour in children,"Background The aim of the present study was to conduct a preliminary empirical evaluation of the KooLKIDS program, a school-based intervention that utilises a combination of whole-of-class and individual sessions for young children with early onset antisocial behaviour. Method Trained facilitators delivered the 13-session program to a completer sample of 49 primary school-aged children (7–11 years) with early onset antisocial behaviour (42 boys and seven girls suspended from school or at risk for suspension) and their peers. Results Analyses showed significant postintervention reductions on many outcome variables, including teacher and child self-rated aggression and antisocial traits. Significant improvements were also found on measures of emotional intensity and peer acceptance. Acceptability and feasibility data were promising. Conclusion KooLKIDS has the potential for redirecting the trajectory of antisocial behaviour towards more positive social and emotional outcomes for these at-risk children.",children; early onset antisocial behaviour; intervention,"Carroll, Annemaree; Sanders O’Connor, Emma; Houghton, Stephen J.; Hattie, John A.; Donovan, Caroline; Lynn, Sasha",2017,10.3109/13668250.2016.1190004,0,60
65,Implementation of a urogynecology-specific enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway,"Objective: Enhanced recovery after surgery protocols were developed for colorectal surgery to hasten postoperative recovery. Variations of the protocol are being adopted for gynecological procedures despite limited population and procedure-specific outcome data. Our objective was to evaluate whether implementation of an enhanced recovery after surgery pathway would facilitate reduced length of admission in a urogynecology population. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective analysis of patients undergoing pelvic floor reconstructive surgery by 7 female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgeons, we compared same-day discharge, length of admission and postoperative complications before and after implementation of an enhanced recovery after surgery pathway at a tertiary care hospital. Groups were compared using χ2 and Student t tests. Candidate variables that could have an impact on patient outcomes with P <.2 were included in multivariable logistic regression models. Satisfaction with surgical experience was assessed using a phone-administered questionnaire the day after discharge. Results: Mean age and body mass index of 258 women (137 before enhanced recovery after surgery and 121 enhanced recovery after surgery) were 65.5 ± 11.3 years and 28.2 ± 5.0 kg/m2. The most common diagnosis was pelvic organ prolapse (n = 242, 93.8%) including stage III pelvic organ prolapse (n = 61, 65.1%). Apical suspension procedures included 58 transvaginal (25.1%), 112 laparoscopic/robotic (48.8%), and 61 obliterative (26.4%). Hysterectomy was performed in 57.4% of women. Demographic and surgical procedures were similar in both groups. Compared with before enhanced recovery after surgery, the enhanced recovery after surgery group had a higher proportion of same-day discharge (25.9% vs 91.7%, P <.001) and a 13.8 hour shorter duration of stay (25.9 ± 13.5 vs 12.1 ± 11.2 hours, P <.001). Operative and postsurgical recovery room times were similar (2.6 ± 0.8 vs 2.6 ± 0.9 hours, P =.955; 3.7 ± 2.1 vs 3.6 ± 2.2 hours, P =.879). Women in the enhanced recovery after surgery group were more likely to be discharged using a urethral catheter (57.9% enhanced recovery after surgery vs 25.4% before enhanced recovery after surgery, P =.005). There were no group differences in total 30 day postoperative complications overall and for the following categories: urinary tract infections, emergency room visits, unanticipated office visits, and return to the operating room. However, enhanced recovery after surgery patients had higher 30 day hospital readmission rates (n = 8, 6.7% vs n = 2, 1.5%, P =.048). Patients before enhanced recovery after surgery were readmitted for myocardial infarction and chest pain. Enhanced recovery after surgery patients were admitted for weakness, chest pain, hyponatremia, wound complications, nausea/ileus, and ureteral obstruction. Three enhanced recovery after surgery patients returned to the operating room for ureteral obstruction (n = 1), incisional hernia (n = 1), and vaginal cuff bleeding (n = 1). Enhanced recovery after surgery patients also had more postoperative nursing phone notes (2.6 ± 1.7 vs 2.1 ± 1.4, P =.030). On multivariable logistic regressions adjusting for age and operative time, same-day discharge was more likely in the enhanced recovery after surgery group (odds ratio, 32.73, 95% confidence interval [15.23–70.12]), while the odds of postoperative complications and emergency room visits were no different. After adjusting for age, operative time, and type of prolapse surgery, readmission was more likely in the enhanced recovery after surgery group (odds ratio, 32.5, 95% confidence interval [1.1–28.1]). In the enhanced recovery after surgery group, patient satisfaction (n = 77 of 121) was reported as very good or excellent by 86.7% for pain control, 89.6% for surgery preparedness, and 93.5% for overall surgical experience; 89.6% did not recall any postoperative nausea during recovery. Conclusion: Enhanced recovery after surgery implementation in a urogynecology population resulted in a greater proportion of same-day discharge and high patient satisfaction but with slightly increased hospital readmissions within 30 days.",enhanced recover after surgery; pelvic floor reconstructive surgery; pelvic organ prolapse; same-day discharge,"Carter-Brooks, Charelle M.; Du, Angela L.; Ruppert, Kristine M.; Romanova, Anna L.; Zyczynski, Halina M.",2018,10.1016/j.ajog.2018.06.009,0,61
66,The dual-diagnosis patient in a psychiatric day treatment program: A treatment failure,"This study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of treating the dual-diagnosis patient in a standard psychiatric day treatment program. These patients, presenting with psychiatric disorder coexisting with alcohol and/or drug abuse, present a major problem in treatment because of their emotional fragility, their propensity to impulsive acting-out behaviors, and their adaptation to psychiatric symptomatology via self-medication with illicit drugs. Of the 24 dual-diagnosis patients admitted to our Day Treatment Center in 1988, 57% left treatment at or before 8 weeks following admission, as opposed to 21% of a nonsubstance abusing psychiatric control group. Their rate of absenteeism and suspensions for continuing abuse and infraction of the rules was four times that of the controls. In light of these data, it appears that these patients require highly specialized treatment strategies not generally available in a conventional psychiatric day hospital. © 1991.",alcohol abuse; day treatment; dual-diagnosis; substance abuse; treatment failures,"Case, Nan",1991,10.1016/0740-5472(91)90029-A,0,62
67,Selective Gut Decontamination Reduces Nosocomial Infections and Length of Stay but Not Mortality or Organ Failure in Surgical Intensive Care Unit Patients,"Suppression of the gut luminal aerobic flora to reduce nosocomial infections was tested in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients in a surgical intensive care unit who had persistent hypermetabolism. Forty-six patients were randomized to receive either norfloxacin, 500-mg suspension every 8 hours, together with nystatin, 1 million units every 6 hours, or matching placebo solutions administered through a nasogastric tube within 48 hours of surgical intensive care unit admission. Selective gut decontamination with the experimental therapy or placebo solutions continued for at least 5 days or until the time of surgical intensive care unit discharge. Patients were monitored with routine surveillance cultures for the development of nosocomial infections, as defined by criteria from the Centers for Disease Control. All other therapy was given as clinically indicated, including systemic antibiotics. The selective gut decontamination group experienced a significant reduction in the incidence of nosocomial infections and a reduced length of stay. However, these results were not associated with a concomitant decrease in progressive multiple organ failure syndrome, adult respiratory distress syndrome, or mortality. © 1992, American Medical Association.

68,Inefficiency of levothyroxine suspension in a neonate with congenital hypothyroidism,"Background: Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the major causes of preventable mental retardation. Diagnosis, hormonal replacement and normalization of thyroid function tests should happen before 2–3 weeks of life. Levothyroxine is the treatment of choice for congenital hypothyroidism. Case presentation: A patient born at 32 weeks for gestational age with a birthweight of 1.73 kg. The pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. The physical exam was unremarkable. The initial newborn screen noted a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) of 70.5 mIU/mL (n < 20 mIU/mL). Serum thyroid function test revealed a TSH of 215 mIU/mL and free thyroxine (FT4) of 0.08 ng/dL. The patient was started on levothyroxine 25 μg tablet daily at day of life (DOL) 7. Repeat TSH and FT4 after 1 week of treatment, revealed a TSH of 0.686 and FT4 of 4.12 ng/dL, levothyroxine was discontinued. Repeat tests after 1 week, showed a TSH of 47.5 mIU/mL and a FT4 of 0.84 ng/dL. Levothyroxine in a liquid form at 25 μg a day was started on DOL 21. On DOL 38, TSH was repeated and was noted to be 120 mIU/mL. Levothyroxine was switched to a tablet formulation and was increased to 37.5 μg daily. Repeat tests at DOL 50, showed a TSH that was trending down to 9.241 mIU/mL. Conclusion: Levothyroxine (T4) is a synthetic hormone considered to be the standard of care for the treatment of congenital hypothyroidism. Treatment is most effective if given orally in tablet form. To date, there are no liquid formulations and no compounding recipes that produce a stable concentration of levothyroxine in the USA. Efforts to create suspensions, especially for neonates, should be carefully considered as this is a critical time for brain development. The case presented shows how treatment of congenital hypothyroidism can be ineffective if using a liquid formulation of levothyroxine.",,"Chan, Jacqueline T.; D’Ambrosio, Fabiola; Minutti, Carla Z.",2019,10.1515/crpm-2018-0046,0,64
69,Associations between the timing of childhood adversity and adulthood suicidal behavior: A nationally-representative cohort,"Background: Although childhood adversities (CAs) are known to be associated with later suicidal behavior, it is uncertain whether the timing of specific CAs may influence this association. Methods: We analyzed nationally representative data for 9205 participants from the Korean Welfare Panel Study. Four different CAs (parental death, parental divorce, suspension of school education and being raised in a relative's house due to financial strain) were assessed and were categorized as early childhood and adolescent onset. Lifetime experiences of suicidal behaviors along with the age of the first time experience were recorded. Cox regression was used. Results: After adjusting for age, sex, and childhood socioeconomic status, parental death before the age of 12 was associated with adulthood suicidal behavior (ideation HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13, 1.61; attempt HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.02, 2.52), while suspension of school due to financial strain was associated with suicidal behavior when it occurred at adolescence (ideation HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.22, 1.79; plan HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.16, 2.48). When we also adjusted for adulthood SES, which is a potential mediator, there was no significant change except that the association between early parental death and suicidal attempt became non-significant (HR: 1.43, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.26). Limitations: Experience of CA was assessed retrospectively, and the assessment of suicidal attempt was not specifically defined. There could be selection bias due to loss to the follow-up. Conclusions: There may be a critical period for the effect of CA on later suicidal behavior depending on the characteristics of CA.",Attempted suicide; Childhood adversity; Epidemiology; Republic of Korea; Suicidal ideation,"Chang, Hyoung Yoon; Chung, Yeonseung; Keyes, Katherine M.; Jung, Sun Jae; Kim, Seung Sup",2015,10.1016/j.jad.2015.06.025,1,65
70,Alternatives to Suspensions: Rationale and Recommendations,"Suspensions are often used as an individual disciplinary consequence in attempts to reduce problem behaviors in the future. However, suspensions have shown to be less effective for students with specific behavioral challenges and problems. When examining suspensions in the context of behaviorist and social-ecological learning theories, suspending may be inappropriate and ineffective to promote learning or behavioral compliance, specifically for students with behavioral skill deficits. A literature review of effective prevention methods (e.g., positive behavior supports) informs a potential paradigm shift in how student misbehavior may be effectively addressed. A proposed model for alternatives to suspensions is presented, with special attention to implications and guidelines for practitioners. Additionally, a pilot initiative implementing alternatives to suspensions is discussed, and a case study serves as an example for recommendations in replacing punitive discipline practices with proactive, learning opportunities. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",alternatives to suspension; positive behavioral supports; school discipline; student behavior problems,"Chin, Jenna K.; Dowdy, Erin; Jimerson, Shane R.; Jeremy Rime, W.",2012,10.1080/15388220.2012.652912,0,66

72,The pediatric asthma yardstick: Practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for children with inadequately controlled asthma,"Current asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management involving assessment of impairment and risk followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. However, for children with asthma, achieving control can be elusive. Although tools are available to help children (and families) track and manage day-to-day symptoms, when and how to implement a longer-term step-up in care is less clear. Furthermore, treatment is challenged by the 3 age groups of childhood—adolescence (12–18 years old), school age (6–11 years old), and young children (≤5 years old)—and what works for 1 age group might not be the best approach for another. The Pediatric Asthma Yardstick provides an in-depth assessment of when and how to step-up therapy for the child with not well or poorly controlled asthma. Development of this tool follows others in the Yardstick series, presenting patient profiles and step-up strategies based on current guidance documents, but modified according to newer data and the authors' combined clinical experience. The objective is to provide clinicians who treat children with asthma practical and clinically relevant recommendations for each step-up and each intervention, with the intent of helping practitioners better treat their pediatric patients with asthma, particularly those who do not always respond to recommended therapies.",,"Chipps, Bradley E.; Bacharier, Leonard B.; Farrar, Judith R.; Jackson, Daniel J.; Murphy, Kevin R.; Phipatanakul, Wanda; Szefler, Stanley J.; Teague, W.

73,"A prospective, longitudinal study of risk factors for early onset of delinquency among maltreated youth","Maltreated youth tend to enter into the juvenile justice system at younger ages than their non-maltreated counterparts. Early involvement in the juvenile justice system compounds maltreated youth's risk of adverse developmental outcomes, including serious and continued offending. This study prospectively examined risk factors of first time delinquency for maltreated youth between ages 9 and 14. Using integrated statewide administrative data from Minnesota, this study followed 5002 students with maltreatment histories in 3rd grade for their first adjudication of delinquency over a 6-year period. Cox proportional hazard regression was employed to model time to youth's first time delinquency, and to identify risk factors. Approximately 7% of maltreated youth (n = 332)were adjudicated as delinquent during this period. The results indicated significant risk factors for early onset of delinquency in maltreated youth: being male (HR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.45, 2.40), belonging to particular racial minority groups, especially Black (HR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.36, 2.39), Native American (HR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.61, 3.39, and Hispanic (HR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.10, 2.71), diagnoses of emotional/behavioral disabilities (HR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.30, 2.93), receiving an out-of-school suspension (HR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.04, 2.25), and experiencing more than three previous maltreatment incidents (HR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.54, 2.64).

74,Effect of commonly prescribed liquid medications on streptococcus mutans biofilm. An in vitro study,"Objective: This study addressed the effect of pediatric liquid antibiotic medications on Streptococcus mutans UA159. These suspensions commonly contain sugars such as sucrose to make them more palatable for children. The study was designed to evaluate the effects of oral liquid antibiotics on Streptococcus mutans growth and biofilm formation. Study Design: A 24 hour culture of S. mutans was treated with various concentrations of liquid medications commonly prescribed to children for odontogenic or fungal infections-amoxicillin, penicillin VK, clindamycin, and nystatin. The study was conducted in sterile 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates. The minimum inhibitory and biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MIC/MBIC) of S. mutans were determined for each medication. S. mutans was cultured with and without the test drugs, the amount of total growth measured, the biofilms washed, fixed, and stained with crystal violet. The absorbance was determined to evaluate biofilm formation. Results: Higher concentrations of amoxicillin, penicillin VK and clindamycin had decreased biofilm and overall growth than the control. The MICs were 1:2,560 (1.95 ug/ml), 1:2,560 (1.95 ug/ml) and 1:40 (9.375 ug/ml), while the MBIC were 1:640 (7.8 ug/ml), 1:1,280 (3.9 ug/ml) and 1:20 (18.75 ug/ml), respectively. Lower concentrations provided increased biofilm and overall growth. Nystatin induced significantly more biofilm and overall growth than the control at all concentrations. Conclusion: At high concentrations, approximately at the levels expected to be present in the oral cavity of children, amoxicillin, penicillin, and clindamycin inhibited S. mutans biofilm and overall growth due to their antibiotic activity, while at lower concentrations the three antibiotics demonstrated an increase in biofilm and growth. The increase in S. mutans biofilm and overall growth is most likely attributed to the sugar content in the medications. Nystatin provided an increase in biofilm and growth at each concentration tested.",Biofilm; Early childhood caries (ECC); Pediatric medications; S. mutans,"Clark, Samantha A.; Vinson, Laquia A.; Eckert, George; Gregory, Richard L.",2017,10.17796/1053-4628-41.2.141,0,70

76,Measuring school-wide positive behavior support implementation: Development and validation of the benchmarks of quality,"School-wide positive behavior support (SWPBS) has been implemented in more than 4,000 schools as a means of addressing problem behavior in a systemic fashion. Preliminary outcomes (e.g., office discipline referrals, suspensions) indicate the effectiveness of SWPBS in decreasing school-wide behavior problems and creating a positive school climate. Although the results of a majority of the program evaluations yielded significant findings, there has been a lack of measurement of treatment fidelity, possibly due to the absence of expedient, effective assessment tools. This article describes the theoretical background and development, including a qualitative pilot study and psychometric properties, of the School-wide Benchmarks of Quality (BoQ; Kincaid, Childs, & George, 2005), a tool intended to measure the implementation of SWPBS. Descriptive data on the instrument, including internal consistency, test-retest reliability, interrater reliability, and concurrent validity, were collected and analyzed. Results indicate that the BoQ for SWPBS is a reliable, valid, efficient, and useful instrument for measuring the fidelity of implementation of the primary or universal level of PBS application in individual schools. Future considerations for evaluating the psychometric properties of the BoQ include extending the data collection and analysis to many more schools across multiple states.",,"Cohen, Rachel; Kincaid, Don; Childs, Karen Elfner",2007,10.1177/10983007070090040301,1,72

79,Implementation of Arkansas’s Initiative to Reduce Suspension and Expulsion of Young Children,"This article describes the development, initial implementation, and formative evaluation of Arkansas’s plan to reduce suspensions and expulsion from early care and education (ECE) settings. We describe how Arkansas used multifaceted implementation strategies to facilitate change in six areas: policy, workforce development, specialized supports, family partnerships, child screening, and data tracking. We also highlight key findings from the formative evaluation. For example, needs assessment data revealed that 40.8% of ECE providers suspended at least one child in the past year, and 9% expelled one or more children. We evaluated efforts to educate ECE providers on new nonexpulsion policies and new supports, and results indicate that 89.5% of directors agreed that they understand why young children should not be suspended or expelled, though the majority reported concern about implementing a nonexpulsion policy. Initial utilization data from a new ECE provider support system indicate that in the first quarter, 53 requests were submitted for help with challenging classroom behavior. Most requests involved male children over the age of 3, and one-third of the requests referenced traumatic events experienced by the children.",challenging behavior; expulsion; social-emotional development; workforce development,"Conners Edge, Nicola A.; Rose, Arlene; Honeycutt, Deneice; McKelvey, Lorraine; Swindle, Taren; Courson, Diana; Forsman, J.

81,Improved classroom quality and child behavior in an Arkansas early childhood mental health consultation pilot project,"The aim of the current study was to examine the effects of early childhood mental health consultation (ECMHC) on teacher-level and child-level outcomes in the context of a partnership between community mental health centers in three regions of Arkansas and publically funded early education programs (14 intervention sites and 4 comparison sites). From 2005 to 2008, 193 teachers participated in the study, along with 1,448 children. Data-collection activities included structured classroom observations, teacher ratings of children's strengths and behavior, and teacher surveys to assess satisfaction with ECMHC services. Results suggest that teachers were highly satisfied with the consultation services and that teachers receiving the intervention had lower levels of permissiveness and detachment, with a trend toward higher levels of sensitivity in interactions with children in their classroom. In terms of child outcomes, we found that by the third year of the project, children at intervention sites were rated by their teachers as having fewer behavior problems and more protective factors. © 2012 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.",,"Conners-Burrow, Nicola A.; Whiteside-Mansell, Leanne; Mckelvey, Lorraine; Virmani, Elita Amini; Sockwell, Latunja",2012,10.1002/imhj.21335,1,76
82,Two-generation psychiatric intervention in the prevention of early childhood maltreatment recidivism,"""Adam"" is a 4-year-old boy who was placed in foster care under the guardianship of his maternal aunt after an emergency department visit for listlessness, where it was discovered that, after a series of coercive disciplinary practices, his mother had overdosed him with clonidine in an attempt to manage his disruptive behavior. After 6 months in the child welfare system, his case was moving toward termination of parental rights, and he and his family were referred by the Family Court for psychiatric support via the SYNCHRONY Project. At this juncture, his mother was a frequent intruder into the home of the foster mother, his maternal aunt (far exceeding the mother's authorized weekly supervised visits), where she (the mother) would desperately attempt to assert her own disciplinary practices over her sister's caregiving of Adam, at times resulting in authorities escorting her from the home. The father was at a loss as to how best to support the mother and had distanced himself from the escalating domestic struggles between mother and aunt. A two-generation evaluation indicated that untreated maternal borderline personality disorder traits were compromising the mother's responses to the circumstances of domestic custody, and untreated attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms in the boy were intensifying the mother's worries about whether her sister was competently caring for him. The clinical teamfirst recommended temporary suspension of maternal visits to the household of the maternal aunt (creating an important boundary that constituted an initial step in an intervention strategy to manage her borderline traits). She was enrolled in dialectical behavior therapy, which she successfully completed. She also benefited from the addition of a low-dose antipsychotic, and her borderline symptoms improved substantially. Simultaneously, a detailed behavior modification protocol was implemented for Adam, to which he responded well. This was followed by family therapy beginning with the couple, the next ending to thematernal aunt and the child. The father became increasingly reengaged, supporting the mother, and he became the supervisor of visits between mother and child. The mother and father next successfully completed group-based parenting education (the Incredible Years curriculum). The family made steady progress, the court disposition was converted to reunification, the child is with his birth parents, and the mother has remained engaged inmonthly supportive psychotherapy with continued healthy outcomes and no maltreatment recidivism in the3 years since reunification.",,"Constantino, John Nicholas; Ben-David, Vered; Navsaria, Neha; Spiegel, T.

83,Some Reflections on the Romance and Degradation of Sports: Watching and Metawatching in the Changing Transitional Space of Sport,"This essay examines sports as a repository for both idealized and degraded parts of self-experience. Sports as action and fantasy catalyze a variety of nostalgic longings, including wishes to resurrect positive experiences from childhood as well as to create false, idealized fantasies about who we wish we were then and now. Sports also contain degraded elements of self that result from attempted reconciliation between playful fantasy and realistic disappointment. Athletes, as the containers of these idealized fantasies, are ambivalently held objects, adored but also hated because they can never live up to the longed-for idealization. The author also examines our longing for a time when play was our job and the suspension of disbelief in sports was a shorter jump from everyday life than the responsibilities and stresses of adult life allow. Nostalgia and the recollection of our sports heroes and our own achievements allow us to dip back into that treasure chest of memory and, of course, fa ntasy. © 2010 2010 William Alanson White Institute and the William Alanson White Society.",Devaluation; Fantasy; Idealization; Nostalgia; Play; Transitional object,"Cooper, Steven",2010,10.1080/00107530.2010.10746078,0,78
84,"Prevalence, comorbidity, and correlates of DSM-5 proposed disruptive mood dysregulation disorder","Objective: No empirical studies on the DSM-5 proposed disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have yet been published. This study estimated prevalence, comorbidity, and correlates of this proposed disorder in the community. Method: Prevalence rates were estimated using data from three community studies involving 7,881 observations of 3,258 participants from 2 to 17 years old. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was diagnosed using structured psychiatric interviews. Results: Three-month prevalence rates for meeting criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder ranged from 0.8% to 3.3%, with the highest rate in preschoolers. Rates dropped slightly with the strict application of the exclusion criterion, but they were largely unaffected by the application of onset and duration criteria. Disruptive mood dysregulation co-occurred with all common psychiatric disorders. The highest levels of cooccurrence were with depressive disorders (odds ratios between 9.9 and 23.5) and oppositional defiant disorder (odds ratios between 52.9 and 103.0). Disruptive mood dysregulation occurred with another disorder 62%-92% of the time, and it occurred with both an emotional and a behavioral disorder 32%-68% of the time. Affected children displayed elevated rates of social impairments, school suspension, service use, and poverty. Conclusions: Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is relatively uncommon after early childhood, frequently cooccurs with other psychiatric disorders, and meets common standards for psychiatric ""caseness."" This disorder identifies children with severe levels of both emotional and behavioral dysregulation.",,"Copeland, William E.; Angold, Adrian; Costello, E.

85,Guidelines for student threat assessment: Field-test findings,"A demonstration project was conducted to field-test guidelines for schools to use in responding to student threats of violence. Results from 188 student threats occurring in 35 schools over the course of one school year are described. School-based teams used a decision-tree model to evaluate the seriousness of a threat and take appropriate action to reduce the threat of violence. Using threat assessment guidelines, the majority of cases (70%) were resolved quickly as transient threats. More serious cases, termed substantive threats (30%), required a more extensive evaluation and intervention plan. Follow-up interviews with school principals revealed that almost all students were able to continue in school or return to school after a brief suspension. Only 3 students were expelled, and none of the threatened acts of violence were carried out. These findings indicate that student threat assessment is a feasible, practical approach for schools that merits more extensive study.",,"Cornell, Dewey G.; Sheras, Peter L.; Kaplan, Sebastian; McConville, David; Douglass, Julea; Elkon, Andrea; McKnight, Lela; Branson, Chris; Cole, Joanna",2004,10.1080/02796015.2004.12086266,0,80
86,Student threat assessment as a standard school safety practice: Results from a statewide implementation study,"Threat assessment has been widely endorsed as a school safety practice, but there is little research on its implementation. In 2013, Virginia became the first state to mandate student threat assessment in its public schools. The purpose of this study was to examine the statewide implementation of threat assessment and to identify how threat assessment teams distinguish serious from nonserious threats. The sample consisted of 1,865 threat assessment cases reported by 785 elementary, middle, and high schools. Students ranged from pre-K to Grade 12, including 74.4% male, 34.6% receiving special education services, 51.2% White, 30.2% Black, 6.8% Hispanic, and 2.7% Asian. Survey data were collected from school-based teams to measure student demographics, threat characteristics, and assessment results. Logistic regression indicated that threat assessment teams were more likely to identify a threat as serious if it was made by a student above the elementary grades (odds ratio 0.57; 95% lower and upper bound 0.42-0.78), a student receiving special education services (1.27; 1.00 -1.60), involved battery (1.61; 1.20 -2.15), homicide (1.40; 1.07-1.82), or weapon possession (4.41; 2.80 -6.96), or targeted an administrator (3.55; 1.73-7.30). Student race and gender were not significantly associated with a serious threat determination. The odds ratio that a student would attempt to carry out a threat classified as serious was 12.48 (5.15-30.22). These results provide new information on the nature and prevalence of threats in schools using threat assessment that can guide further work to develop this emerging school safety practice.",School safety; School violence; Serious and nonserious threats; Threat assessment,"Cornell, Dewey; Maeng, Jennifer L.; Burnette, Anna Grace; Jia, Yuane; Huang, Francis; Konold, Timothy; Datta, Pooja; Malone, Marisa; Meyer, Patrick",2018,10.1037/spq0000220,0,81
87,Racial/ethnic parity in disciplinary consequences using student threat assessment,"School psychologists are frequently called upon to assess students who have made verbal or behavioral threats of violence against others, a practice commonly known as threat assessment. One critical issue is whether the outcomes of a threat assessment generate the kind of racial disparities widely observed in school disciplinary practices. In 2013, Virginia became the first state to mandate threat assessment teams in all public schools. This study examined the disciplinary consequences for 1,836 students who received a threat assessment in 779 Virginia elementary, middle, and high schools during the 2014–2015 school year. Multilevel logistic regression models found no disparities among Black, Hispanic, and White students in out-of-school suspensions, school transfers, or legal actions. The most consistent predictors of disciplinary consequences were the student’s possession of a weapon and the team classification of the threat as serious. We discuss possible explanations for the absence of racial/ethnic disparities in threat assessment outcomes and cautiously suggest that the threat assessment process may reflect a generalizable pathway for achieving parity in school discipline.",Racial disparity; School discipline; School safety; Threat assessment,"Cornell, Dewey; Maeng, Jennifer; Huang, Francis; Shukla, Kathan; Konold, Timothy",2018,10.17105/SPR-2017-0030.V47-2,1,82
89,Pivotal efficacy trials of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma,"Background Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the mainstay of daily controller treatment for persistent and uncontrolled asthma. However, many clinicians are wary of ICSs because of safety concerns. Clinicians need to know the underlying efficacy data that support the use of ICSs to weigh efficacy against safety. Objective To discuss efficacy data from pivotal trials to aid clinicians in their decisions to use ICSs. Methods Key efficacy studies were selected to augment discussion. Results Clinical studies have revealed that ICSs are effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations in both children and adults. ICSs also reduce the risk of hospitalization and asthma-related death, improve asthma symptoms, and improve quality of life. In addition, ICSs improve lung function and airway responsiveness and reduce airway inflammation and remodeling. In young children, ICSs improve daytime and nighttime symptoms, improve lung function, reduce the risk of exacerbations, and reduce the need for rescue medications. To date, evidence is conflicting about whether intermittent ICS treatment is as effective as daily ICS treatment. The possibility of lower efficacy of intermittent therapy needs to be weighed against a reduced risk of slowed growth in children. Conclusion ICSs effectively reduce the risk of exacerbations, hospitalizations, and asthma-related death and improve asthma symptoms, quality of life, lung function, and airway responsiveness. ICSs also reduce airway inflammation and remodeling. Intermittent therapy may not be as effective as daily therapy, and clinicians should weigh reduced efficacy against reduced risk of adverse effects, particularly slowed growth in children.",,"Covar, Ronina A.",2016,10.1016/j.anai.2016.07.035,0,83
90,Treating the wheezing infant,"The management of infants and small children with asthma is a challenging task because of the many issues unique to this age group that deserve special consideration. The diagnosis of asthma is limited by inherent difficulties in obtaining objective measures of lung function and airway inflammation. In persistently symptomatic patients, the decision to initiate controller therapy is not as great an issue as it is in infants and young children with recurrent episodic wheeze in whom early intervention may allow a window of opportunity potentially to alter the course of the disease. The reality is that even if atopy has been consistently implicated in the development of persistent asthma, there is not a well-established set of criteria by which patients who are likely to benefit from early intervention controller therapy can be identified. Hence, large prospective studies need to be performed evaluating the impact of early pharmacologic intervention on the natural history of infantile asthma. Many areas needing investigation involve what medications to use, how best to deliver the medications, and how to monitor the response to treatment. Only a few medications have been approved for use in this population. Long-term studies evaluating available drugs such as inhaled glucocorticoids, LABAs, and the leukotriene-modifying agents in young children still need to be performed.",,"Covar, Ronina A.; Spahn, Joseph D.",2003,10.1016/S0031-3955(03)00051-8,0,84
91,Ovarian repositioning in pediatric cancer patients: Flexible techniques accommodate pelvic radiation fields,"Treatments for childhood cancer and consequent long-term survival rates continue to improve. As the success of these therapies advances, premature ovarian failure and sterility have become an increasingly evident long-term morbidity. Abdominal and pelvic radiation have been specifically shown to induce early menopause and decreased fertility. In order to minimize radiation injury, we utilized novel techniques to reposition ovaries in two girls with pelvic tumors prior to initiation of pelvic radiation. One girl with a sacral Ewing sarcoma underwent laparoscopic anterior suspension of the ovaries, using a simple and easily reversible technique. The second patient, who underwent hysterectomy for a recurrent uterine rhabdomyosarcoma, underwent widely lateral and cephalad repositioning of the ovaries. Both procedures were well tolerated, with no significant morbidity. In both cases the ovaries were moved well beyond the planned radiation field. We propose that open or laparoscopic ovarian repositioning in children is a simple, flexible, and reversible option to reduce radiation injury to the ovaries in pediatric cancer patients. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Endocrinology; Late effects of cancer treatment; Ovary; Radiation therapy; Sarcoma; Surgery,"Cowles, Robert A.; Gewanter, Richard M.; Kandel, Jessica J.",2007,10.1002/pbc.20652,0,85
92,Ethanol exposure during the brain growth spurt impairs habituation and promotes locomotor hyperactivity of infant mice in the tail suspension test.,"Ethanol exposure during development promotes a series of neurobehavioral disorders in both humans and rodents. While in humans the deficits are most evident during childhood, in rodents most studies focus on the investigation of effects from adolescence onward. Considering that the examination of habituation at early ages provides a useful tool to assess learning and memory and its development, here we used the tail suspension test (TST) to investigate whether habituation of infant and adolescent mice is affected by ethanol exposure during the neonatal period. From postnatal day (PN) 2 to PN6, Swiss mice either received ethanol (5g/kg ip, ETOH) or saline (CONT) every other day. Mice were subjected to the TST for 6 min on alternate days from PN14 to PN20 (infancy) or from PN28 to PN34 (early adolescence). Only lateral (left- or rightward) movements with the torso were scored and used as a measure of activity. Differences between ETOH and CONT groups were observed during infancy. The activity decreased from PN16 to PN20 in the CONT group but did not change in the ETOH group. In addition, the averaged activity of the ETOH group was higher than that of the CONT group. No differences were observed between CONT and ETOH mice tested from PN28 to PN34. Our data suggest that the TST can be an important tool for the study of the effects of neonatal ethanol exposure in infant mice.

Men were more likely to report involvement as perpetrators and perpetrator-victims than were women. Students recommended advertisements featuring famous people who emphasized the impact of cyberbullying on victims. They preferred a comprehensive approach teaching skills to prevent cyberbullying, encouraging students to report incidents, enabling anonymous online reporting, and terminating the internet privileges of students involved as perpetrators. Those who cyberbully were least likely, and victims of cyberbullying were most likely, to support an approach combining prevention and consequences.

94,"Traffic crashes, violations, and suspensions among young drivers with ADHD","OBJECTIVES: To compare monthly rates of specific types of crashes, violations, and license suspensions over the first years of licensure for drivers with and without attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: We identified patients of New Jersey primary care locations of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who were born in 1987–1997, were New Jersey residents, had their last primary care visit at age $12 years, and acquired a driver’s license (N = 14 936). Electronic health records were linked to New Jersey’s licensing, crash, and violation databases. ADHD diagnosis was based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes. We calculated monthly per-driver rates of crashes (at fault, alcohol related, nighttime, and with peers), violations, and suspensions. Adjusted rate ratios were estimated by using repeated-measures Poisson regression. RESULTS: Crash rates were higher for drivers with ADHD regardless of licensing age and, in particular, during the first month of licensure (adjusted rate ratio: 1.62 [95% confidence interval: 1.1822.23]). They also experienced higher rates of specific crash types: their 4-year rate of alcohol-related crashes was 2.1 times that of drivers without ADHD. Finally, drivers with ADHD had higher rates of moving violations (for speeding, seat belt nonuse, and electronic equipment use) and suspensions. In the first year of driving, the rate of alcohol and/ or drug violations was 3.6 times higher for adolescents with ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with ADHD are at particularly high crash risk in their initial months of licensure, and engagement in preventable risky driving behaviors may contribute to this elevated risk. Comprehensive preventive approaches that extend beyond current recommendations are critically needed.",,"Curry, Allison E.; Yerys, Benjamin E.; Metzger, Kristina B.; Carey, Meghan E.; Power, Thomas J.",2019,10.1542/peds.2018-2305,0,88

Thirty-four Zambian girls aged 13 to 19 years admitted to University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka were interviewed using a semistructured questionnaire with both closed and open-ended questions. Results revealed that most of the girls were single, in school, reached higher grades, mainly nulliparous, and had very low knowledge of contraceptive use. Reasons given for performing unsafe abortions were fear of facing personal shame and social stigma following premarital pregnancies, such as parental disapproval, abandonment by partner, and expulsion from school. A blend of traditional and modern methods and medicines were used to abort. Limited access to contraception and the stigma attached to premarital pregnancies and abortions are likely to continue to compel girls to rely on clandestine abortions if comprehensive adolescent reproductive health services are not provided.

98,Delayed hypoxemia after traumatic brain injury exacerbates long-term behavioral deficits,"Hypoxemia during initial stabilization of patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated with poorer outcomes. However, the effects of delayed hypoxemia occurring during intensive care post-TBI on outcome is unclear. Pre-clinical models of TBI have rarely shown cognitive or behavioral deficits beyond 6 weeks post-injury and commonly have not included modeling of secondary insults. We have previously developed a murine model of TBI followed by delayed hypoxemia to model the secondary insult of hypoxemia and brain hypoxia occurring in the intensive care setting. Understanding long-term effects of delayed hypoxemia post-TBI in our murine model is critical for future testing of candidate therapeutics targeting secondary brain hypoxia. For this study, forty 5-week-old male mice were randomized to controlled cortical impact (CCI; N = 24) or sham surgery (N = 16). One day later, awake animals were randomized to 60 min of hypoxemia or normoxemia. Six months after initial injury, animals underwent behavior testing (Morris water maze, social interaction, and tail suspension) before euthanasia for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessments. At 6 months post-injury, mice experiencing CCI and hypoxemia (CCI+H) had longer swim distances to the hidden platform (51 cm) compared to CCI alone (26 cm) or sham animals (22 cm). During social interaction assessments, CCI + H mice spent less time interacting with novel stimulus mice (79 sec) than CCI alone (101 sec) or sham animals (139 sec). CCI + H had larger lesion volumes compared to CCI alone (14.0% vs. 9.9%; p < 0.003). Glial fibrillary acidic protein IHC at 6 months post-injury demonstrated increased astrogliosis in the ipsilateral white matter of CCI + H compared to CCI alone. To summarize, this clinically relevant model of delayed hypoxia post-TBI resulted in long-term behavioral deficits and evidence of exacerbated structural injury.",controlled cortical impact; delayed hypoxemia; long-term behavior; secondary injury; traumatic brain injury,"Davies, McKenzie; Jacobs, Addison; Brody, David L.; Friess, Stuart H.",2018,10.1089/neu.2017.5354,0,92

100,Extended Release Liposomal Bupivacaine Injection (Exparel) for Early Postoperative Pain Control Following Palatoplasty,"Introduction: Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is a long-acting local anesthetic reported to decrease postoperative pain in adults. The authors demonstrate the safe use of LB in pediatric patients with improved pain control following palatoplasty. Materials and Methods: Retrospective patient series of all single-surgeon palatoplasty patients treated at a tertiary craniofacial center from August 2014 to December 2015 were included. All patients received 1.3% LB intraoperatively as greater palatal nerve and surgical field blocks in 2-flap V-Y pushback palatoplasty. Postoperative oral intake, opioids administered, duration of hospitalization, and FLACC (face, legs, activity, cry, consolability) pain scores were measured. Results: Twenty-seven patients (16 males and 11 females, average age of 10.8 months, weight 8.8kg) received 2.9±0.9mL (2.6±1.9mg/kg) 1.3% LB. Average FLACC scores were 2.4±2.2/10 in the postanesthesia care unit and 3.8±1.8/10 while inpatients. Oral intake was first tolerated 10.3±11.5hours postoperatively and tolerated 496.4±354.2 mL orally in the first 24hours postoperatively. Patients received 8.5±8.4mg hydrocodone equivalents (0.46±0.45mg/kg per d hydrocodone equivalents) and were discharged 2.1±1.3 days postoperatively. Opioid-related adverse events included emesis in 7.4% and pruritis in 3.7% of patients. Conclusions: The LB may be used safely in pediatric patients. Intraoperative injection of LB during palatoplasty can yield low postoperative opioid use and an early and adequate volume of oral intake over an average hospital stay. Further cost-efficacy studies of LB are needed to assess its value in pediatric plastic surgery.",Exparel; liposomal bupivacaine; pain control; palatoplasty; postoperative,"Day, Kristopher M.; Nair, Narayanan M.; Sargent, Larry A.",2018,10.1097/SCS.0000000000004591,0,94
101,Venlafaxine and Nortriptyline Reverse Acute Dexamethasone-Induced Depressive-Like Behaviors in Male and Female Mice,"Major depression can be triggered by stressful events that promote deregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis response and, in some circumstances, persistent elevation of circulating glucocorticoid levels. Animal models are widely used to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the etiology and treatment of major depression. However, to mimic the dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in rodents, animals should be exposed to sustained physical and psychological stressful situations. These animal models of depression are labor intensive and impact individual animals differently. Aiming to add evidence for a new acute neuroendocrine model of depression, male and female mice were treated with a single administration of dexamethasone, and behavioral effects were evaluated in the presence and absence of the antidepressants nortriptyline and venlafaxine. Male and female Swiss mice were treated with dexamethasone (0.07 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and the mouse behavior was assessed in the tail suspension and open field tests at 4 h, 24 h, and 7 days after administration. Dexamethasone induced depressogenic-like states in both sexes at 4 and 24 h after injection. Additionally, acute dexamethasone increased latency to body fur licking, thus corroborating the depressive-like behavior. The treatment with nortriptyline and venlafaxine (both at 30 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) blocked dexamethasone-induced increase in the immobility time and the latency to self-care. In conclusion, the present findings suggest that a single administration of dexamethasone induces depressive-like states in male and female mice, and these behavioral alterations are counteracted by conventional antidepressants. Ultimately, these data provide new evidence for an acute neuroendocrine model of depression.",Acute exposure; Dexamethasone; Major depression; Splash test; Tail suspension test,"de Souza, Ingrid B.M.B.; Costa, Layse R.F.; Tiago, Pamella R.F.; Cagni, Fernanda C.; Lima, Ramon H.; Silva Junior, Edilson D.; Gavioli, Elaine C.",2019,10.1037/pha0000263,0,95
102,Observed Characteristics of Suicidal Hangings: An 11-year Retrospective Review,"Many studies have been published regarding suicidal hanging deaths, and most forensic pathologists and coroners are very familiar with such causes of death. Forensic pathologists are challenged over their rulings regarding manner of death in part because the general public has a limited scope of knowledge. One such challenge centers on the question of whether a hanging can be a suicide if the individual is not fully suspended. The authors designed a retrospective study to review suspension in hangings and to analyze other criteria used to help in deciding manner of death. We examined 229 suicidal hanging deaths over an 11-year period (1997 through early 2009) using the data from two separate jurisdictions in Ohio. In conclusion, we found that the vast majority (83.4%) of people who hanged themselves were found partially suspended. Among other criteria analyzed, only the presence of petechial hemorrhages and acute neck injury was statistically significant. © 2012 American Academy of Forensic Sciences.",Forensic pathology; Forensic science; Full suspension; Hanging; Neck injury; Partial suspension; Statistics; Suicide,"Dean, Dorothy E.; Kohler, Lisa J.; Sterbenz, George C.; Gillespie, Patrick J.; Gonzaga, Niki S.; Bauer, Laurie J.; Looman, Karen; Owens, O'dell",2012,10.1111/j.1556-4029.2012.02230.x,0,96
103,Television news and the making of the boston busing crisis,"People outside of Boston came to know and care about the city's ""busing crisis"" because television news featured the story regularly and this essay examines how television news framed this story for national audiences. This essay illuminates the production techniques of a medium that framed the ""busing crisis"" in Boston for millions of national viewers. First, I examine how the television coverage of Boston busing in the mid-1970s focused on reports, analysis, and predictions regarding antibusing protests and violence. This day-to-day focus on current and emergent scenes of crisis ignored the history of desegregation efforts since the 1960s, including those that received television coverage in earlier years, like the community-funded Operation Exodus program to bus black children to schools in other neighborhoods and the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's suspension of federal school aid to Boston for violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Second, I consider how television news framed the use of force in the Boston busing story. Much of the footage from Boston focused on confrontations between antibusing protestors and authorities from the Boston Police and other law enforcement. Third, I look at how television news offered viewers background reports on two of the places at the center of the busing story, South Boston and Charlestown. Finally, I analyze how local television news programs in other cities presented busing in Boston as a failed policy and regularly replayed the archived footage from Boston to underscore efforts to educate viewers on the importance of upholding the law and avoiding violence. Boston was neither the first nor the last city to witness violent resistance to school desegregation, but extensive television news coverage fixed Boston as the emblematic busing crisis and shaped popular conceptions of the history of busing for school desegregation.",Boston; Busing; Civil rights; Education; Media; Television,"Delmont, Matthew",2017,10.1177/0096144216688279,0,97
104,Community health contexts and school suspensions of students with disabilities,"Purpose: Students with disabilities with unmet health care needs are vulnerable to adverse educational outcomes, including exclusionary discipline. We examined the association between schools' spatial proximity to health care providers and their use of suspension to discipline students with disabilities. Methods: The study sample included the 398 public secondary schools in the Boston Metropolitan Statistical Area. We merged census-tract and school-level data from several sources, including the American Community Survey, the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and the U.S. Department of Education. Zero-inflated beta regression models were used to examine the association between schools' locations in medically underserved areas (MUAs)and the out-of-school suspension rates of students qualifying for special education services in the 2013–14 school year. Nested models and mediation analysis were used to parse the effects of medical underservice and neighborhood poverty on suspension rates. Results: The suspension rate of students with disabilities was about 5 percentage points higher in schools located in medically underserved areas compared to schools that are not in MUAs, controlling for school- and neighborhood-level characteristics (z = 1.97, p <.05). Medical underservice significantly mediated the effect of neighborhood poverty on suspensions of students with disabilities (indirect effect, p <.05), accounting for 44% of the total effect of poverty. Conclusions: The findings indicate that schools with limited geographic access to health care services may more likely to use suspension as a tool to manage the behavior of students with disabilities.",Geography; Medical underservice; School suspension; Students with disabilities,"Dembo, Robert S.; LaFleur, Jennifer",2019,10.1016/j.childyouth.2019.04.027,1,98
105,Accepted monitoring or endured quarantine? Ebola contacts’ perceptions in Senegal,"During the 2014–2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic, transmission chains were controlled through contact tracing, i.e., identification and follow-up of people exposed to Ebola cases. WHO recommendations for daily check-ups of physical symptoms with social distancing for 21 days were unevenly applied and sometimes interpreted as quarantine. Criticisms arose regarding the use of coercion and questioned contact tracing on ethical grounds. This article aims to analyze contact cases’ perceptions and acceptance of contact monitoring at the field level. In Senegal, an imported case of Ebola virus disease in September 2014 resulted in placing 74 contact cases in home containment with daily visits by volunteers. An ethnographic study based on in-depth interviews with all stakeholders performed in September–October 2014 showed four main perceptions of monitoring: a biosecurity preventive measure, suspension of professional activity, stigma attached to Ebola, and a social obligation. Contacts demonstrated diverse attitudes. Initially, most contacts agreed to comply because they feared being infected. They adhered to the national Ebola response measures and appreciated the empathy shown by volunteers. Later, acceptance was improved by the provision of moral, economic, and social support, and by the final lack of any new contamination. But it was limited by the socio-economic impact on fulfilling basic needs, the fear of being infected, how contacts’ family members interpreted monitoring, conflation of contacts as Ebola cases, and challenging the rationale for containment. Acceptance was also related to individual aspects, such as the professional status of women and health workers who had been exposed, and contextual aspects, such as the media's role in the social production of stigma. Ethnographic results show that, even when contacts adhere rather than comply to containment through coercion, contact monitoring raises several ethical issues. These insights should contribute to the ethics debate about individual rights versus crisis public health measures.",Africa; Contact tracing; Ebola; Ethics; Quarantine; Senegal; Social distancing,"Desclaux, Alice; Badji, Dioumel; Ndione, Albert Gautier; Sow, Khoudia",2017,10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.02.009,0,99
106,'A space to float with someone': 1 recovering play as a field of repair in work with parents of late-adopted children,"Research has increasingly focused on play as a social rather than a solitary domain. Play is a stage on which conflicts and wishes may be expressed to a responsive and containing other. As a group, late-adopted latency children show high levels of inhibition, regression and catastrophe in play, and adoptive parents may find this hard to engage with. The current study undertook a qualitative analysis of transcripts from groups run in the development of an adoption-specific parenting programme that emphasises play as a form of communication. Results indicate that adoptive parents habitually coped with play using counterproductive strategies that were predominantly avoidant or controlling; the programme facilitated some suspension of these defences. These findings are discussed with reference to children in therapy and individual work with their parents, who may be enabled better to support play through exploring their own conflicts and assumptions.",Adoption; Late-adopted children; Parent-training; Parent-work; Parental attitudes to play; Play,"Desmarais, Sarah",2006,10.1080/00754170600996879,0,100
107,Homicide by decubitus ulcers,"Traditionally, the only penalties for poor treatment of nursing home patients have been civil lawsuits against nursing homes and their employees by families, or fines and license suspension by government organizations. Recently, government agencies have become much more aggressive in citing institutions for the development of decubitus ulcers (pressure sores) in their patients. A few government institutions have concluded that in some cases, the development of ulcers with resultant death is so grievous that there should be criminal prosecution of the individuals and/or institutions providing care. A leader in this concept has been the State of Hawaii. In November 2000, the State of Hawaii convicted an individual of manslaughter in the death of a patient at an adult residential care home (a form of nursing home) for permitting the progression of decubitus ulcers without seeking medical help, and for not bringing the patient back to a physician for treatment of the ulcers.",Decubitus ulcers; Homicide; Nursing care,"Di Maio, Vincent J.M.; Di Maio, Theresa G.",2002,10.1097/00000433-200203000-00001,0,101
108,Dissociation of motor maturation,"We prospectively acquired clinical data regarding the presentation, evaluation, and developmental progress of all patients identified with dissociated motor maturation to define their clinical outcomes. Children (N = 8) referred for evaluation of suspected cerebral palsy because of delayed sitting or walking and identified to have dissociated motor maturation were followed with serial clinical examination. All displayed the characteristic ""sitting on air"" posture while held in vertical suspension and had otherwise normal developmental assessments. This posture is composed of the hips held in flexion and abduction with the knees extended and feet plantar or dorsiflexed. Three children were initially evaluated at 10 months of age owing to absence of sitting and five other children were evaluated at a mean of 14 months (range 12-19 months) owing to inability to stand. Follow-up evaluations were conducted over a mean of 10.5 months (range 5-34 months). Five children were born prematurely at 34 to 36 weeks gestation. Denver Developmental Screening Test and general and neurologic examinations were normal except to note hypotonia in six children and the ""sitting on air"" posture in all of the children. Four children have older siblings or parents who ""walked late"" (after 15 months). On average, the children attained sitting by 8 months (range 7-10 months). One child did not crawl prior to independent walking, two children scooted rather than crawled, and five children crawled at an average of 13.5 months (range 10-16 months). All children cruised by a mean of 18 months (range 16-21.5 months) and attained independent walking by 20.1 months (range 18-23.5 months). Neuroimaging and serum creatine kinase enzyme testing were normal in two children who were tested. These eight children conform to the syndrome of dissociated motor maturation. The ""sitting on air"" posture serves as a diagnostic sign and anticipated excellent prognosis, but follow-up is required to ensure a normal outcome.",,"DiMario, Francis J.",2003,10.1177/08830738030180060901,0,102
109,Neutropenia: Ocorrência e manejo em mulheres com câncer de mama em quimioterapia,"Objectives: to identify the prevalence, and describe the management of, neutropenia throughout the chemotherapy treatment among women with breast cancer. Methods: observational study, cycles of chemotherapy. 116 neutropenic events were recorded, and 63.3% of the patients presented neutropenia at some point of their treatment, 46.5% of these presenting grade II. The management used was temporary suspension between the cycles and the mean number of delays was 6 days. The study was prospective and longitudinal, where the evaluation of the hematological toxicities was undertaken at each cycle of chemotherapy, whether neoadjuvant or adjuvant. Results: 79 women were included, who received 572 cycles. However, the reasons for the suspensions were the lack of a space in the chemotherapy center, followed by neutropenia. Conclusion: neutropenia is one of the most common and serious adverse events observed during the chemotherapy. Nursing must invest in research regarding this adverse event and in management strategies for organizing the public health system, so as to offer quality care. © 2014 Revista Latino-Americana de Enfermagem.",Breast neoplasms; Drug therapy/adverse effects; Nursing,"do Nascimento, Talita Garcia; de Andrade, Marceila; de Oliveira, Rosemeire Aparecida; de Almeida, Ana Maria; Gozzo, Thais de Oliveira",2014,10.1590/0104-1169.3305.2416,0,103
110,Suspended Life Pattern: A Qualitative Study on Personal Life Among Family Caregivers of Hemodialysis Patients in Iran,"Purpose: To determine the personal life of family caregivers of patients undergoing hemodialysis. Methodology: In this qualitative study, individual semistructured interviews were carried out with 19 caregivers of hemodialysis patients. All interviews were recorded, typed, and imported into the Open Code Software. The Graneheim and Lundman's content analysis approach was used for the analysis. Findings: The theme of this study was suspended life pattern that was extracted from two categories of “Imbalance between caregiving and life” and “ambiguity in life status.” The category of “Imbalance between caregiving and life” included some subcategories including compulsive compliance, suspension, and deferral of roles, conflicts between leisure time and caregiving and caregivers' time limits. Moreover, the category “ambiguity in life” was extracted from two subcategories of fear and hope and life satisfaction depending on care recipients' condition. Conclusion: Caring for hemodialysis patients leads to instability and ambiguity in a caregiver's personal life. Therefore, authorities, policymakers, and health-care providers should pay more attention to support these people.",family caregiver; hemodialysis; life,"Ebadi, Abbas; Sajadi, Seyedeh A.; Moradian, Seyed T.; Akbari, Roghayeh",2018,10.1177/0272684X18773763,0,104

A representative community sample of 420 maltreated children in kindergarten through Grade 12 were matched with 420 nonmaltreated children in the same community. Using social service and school records as the sources of data, we found maltreated children performed significantly below their nonmaltreated peers in standardized tests and grades and were more likely to repeat a grade. Maltreated children also had significantly more discipline referrals and suspensions. Of the maltreated children, neglected children showed the poorest outcomes on academic performance, and physically abused children showed the most discipline problems. Variations in maltreatment effects by grade level, public assistance status, and gender are also described.",,"Eckenrode, John; Laird, Molly; Doris, John",1993,10.1037/0012-1649.29.1.53,1,105
112,Children in Crisis: Special Education Status and Other Stressors in the Lives of Children Removed from School by Expulsion,"This exploratory qualitative study examines what occurred in the lives of kindergarten through twelfth-grade students who were expelled from school in order to understand possible stressors in their lives. Data were obtained on expulsion cases from a variety of school districts in one midwestern state. The sample (N = 91) consisted of the total number of full school-year (August-June) expulsion cases collected by a statewide child advocacy center. Analysis of student case files revealed the reason for the expulsion, whether students had experienced stressors or had special education status prior to their expulsion, and the short-term school-related outcomes in each case. Study findings as well as recommendations based on the findings, with an emphasis on prevention, are presented. A major finding of this study is that 19.6 percent of students who had been expelled had special education or Section 504 status and were expelled without the due process provided by the manifestation determination guidelines inherent in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. A second major finding is that 51.6 percent of those who were expelled had experienced stressors prior to their expulsion. Only 25.3 percent of those in the sample were reinstated to their school of origin. Policy recommendations include the need for school personnel, parents, mental health professionals, social workers, and students in school social work programs to be aware of the child-find and manifestation determination guidelines in IDEA.

113,The association between intrauterine balloon tamponade duration and postpartum hemorrhage outcomes,"Background Intrauterine balloon tamponade is an effective treatment for postpartum hemorrhage when first-line treatments fail. The optimal duration of intrauterine balloon tamponade for management of postpartum hemorrhage is unclear. Objective The objective of the study was to determine whether intrauterine balloon tamponade removal >12 hours of duration is associated with postpartum hemorrhage–related clinical outcomes. Study Design This was a retrospective cohort study of women with postpartum hemorrhage from 2007 through 2014 who underwent intrauterine balloon tamponade. We excluded failures of intrauterine balloon tamponade (intrauterine balloon expulsion with duration <2 hours or if hysterectomy was required prior to planned intrauterine balloon removal). Patients who underwent intrauterine balloon tamponade for 2–12 hours were compared with those who underwent intrauterine balloon tamponade for >12 hours. Examined postpartum hemorrhage–related clinical outcomes included estimated blood loss after intrauterine balloon tamponade placement, blood product transfusion, use of adjuvant measures to control postpartum hemorrhage after intrauterine balloon tamponade (either uterine artery embolization or hysterectomy), and maternal intensive care unit admission. Secondary outcomes examined included postpartum fever and hospital length of stay. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to control for confounding variables. Results Of 274 eligible women, 206 (75%) underwent intrauterine balloon tamponade for >12 hours and 68 (25%) underwent intrauterine balloon tamponade for 2–12 hours. The median estimated blood loss after intrauterine balloon tamponade placement (190 vs 143 mL, P = .116) as well as the frequencies of blood product transfusion (62.1% vs 51.5%, P = .120), transfusion of ≥4 U of packed red blood cells (17.0% vs 14.7%, P = .659), uterine artery embolization (15.1% vs 16.2%, P = .823), hysterectomy (0.0% vs 1.5%, P = .248), and intensive care unit admission (8.7% vs 7.4%, P = .721), was not statistically different between the groups, and this lack of association persisted in multivariable regressions. Intrauterine balloon tamponade duration >12 hours was associated with a higher frequency of postpartum fever (27% vs 15%, P = .047) and a longer mean hospital length of stay (3.7 vs 3.1 days, P = .002). After adjusting for variables that differed statistically between groups, the difference in length of stay associated with intrauterine balloon tamponade duration was no longer present, but the association between intrauterine balloon tamponade duration >12 hours and postpartum fever persisted (odds ratio, 2.33, 95% confidence interval, 1.07–5.11). Including chorioamnionitis as an independent variable in a post hoc multivariable analysis diminished the association between intrauterine balloon tamponade >12 hours and postpartum fever (adjusted odds ratio, 2.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.92–4.53). Conclusion There are no significant differences in postpartum hemorrhage–related outcomes associated with intrauterine balloon tamponade duration >12 hours compared with removal 2–12 hours. If ongoing hemorrhage has abated, it is reasonable to consider the removal of an intrauterine balloon by 12 hours after its initial placement.",intrauterine balloon tamponade; postpartum hemorrhage,"Einerson, Brett D.; Son, Moeun; Schneider, Patrick; Fields, Ian; Miller, Emily S.",2017,10.1016/j.ajog.2016.10.040,0,107

Data sources: Selected research and clinical articles; 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. Conclusions: Proper diagnosis leads to appropriate treatment of asthma in preschool-aged children, which facilitates asthma control. Well-controlled asthma results in fewer asthma exacerbations, fewer nighttime awakenings, and an increased ability to engage in normal childhood activities. Implications for practice: Advanced practice nurses are in the position to aid in the initial diagnosis of asthma in preschool-aged children through taking detailed medical histories, providing thorough physical examinations, and, if needed, initiating a therapeutic trial with an inhaled corticosteroid. Proper diagnosis and management of asthma is essential to reduce asthma complications, such as exacerbations leading to emergency department visits and hospitalizations. © 2009 American Academy of Nurse Practitioners.",Controller therapy; Inhaled corticosteroid; Preschool-aged childhood asthma,"Ellis, Kathleen C.",2009,,0,108

117,Treatment duration is associated with functioning and prognosis in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Objective: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) persists through adolescence and adulthood, and 15-80% of the children diagnosed with ADHD continue to have the disorder into adulthood, depending on the diagnostic criteria used; however, these findings have mostly been derived from follow-up studies in North America. The longitudinal outcomes of ADHD children from non-Western countries, such as Turkey, and the prognostic differences between ADHD+Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and ADHD+Conduct Disorder (CD) cases require further exploration. Six years after an initial study of 18 months conducted between 2000 and 2002, we sought to evaluate 120 cases of ADHD with comorbid ODD or CD. Methods: The original sample included 120 ADHD + ODD/CD children, followed for 18 months during 2000-2002. We evaluated the last-known psychiatric status, academic achievement, substance use, and social functionality of 60 children who were interviewed six years earlier. The treatment duration was divided into three groups: less than 15 months, 15-45 months, and greater than 45 months. Results: In the initial study, we found that both combined treatment (parent training and stimulant treatment) and only stimulant treatment were effective in reducing ADHD, ODD, and CD symptoms. Six years after the initial study, the ADHD treatment was found to be effective in many areas, including academic success (p<0.001), grade retention (p=0.026), expulsion or suspension from school (p=0.009), rate of accidents and broken bones requiring reduction (p=0.001), and cigarette smoking (p=0.018). Conclusions: ADHD symptoms are associated with impairments in multiple functional domains, and ADHD treatment is effective for Turkish children in many of these domains.

118,A comparison of research utilization among nurses working in Canadian civilian and United States Army healthcare settings,"Researchers and theorists working in the field of knowledge translation point to the importance of organizational context in influencing research utilization. The study purpose was to compare research utilization in two different healthcare contexts - Canadian civilian and United States (US) Army settings. Contrary to the investigators' expectations, research utilization scores were lower in US Army settings, after controlling for potential predictors. In-service attendance, library access, belief suspension, gender, and years of experience interacted significantly with the setting (military or civilian) for research utilization. Predictors of research utilization common to both settings were attitude and belief suspension. Predictors in the US Army setting were trust and years of experience, and in the Canadian civilian setting were in-service attendance, time (organizational), research champion, and library access. While context is of central importance, individual and organizational predictors interact with context in important although not well-understood ways, and should not be ignored. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Evidence-based nursing; Military nursing; Nursing practice; Organizational context; Research utilization,"Estabrooks, Carole A.; Kenny, Deborah J.; Adewale, Adeniyi J.; Cummings, Greta G.; Mallidou, Anastasia A.",2007,10.1002/nur.20218,0,111

Methods: This trial included a two- to eight-week titration and stabilization period to achieve effective target doses and a 24-week maintenance phase. The primary outcome measure was the seizure-free rate over six months, while a secondary measure was the change in cognition and behavior from screening to the end of the maintenance phase. The effectiveness of OXC was compared in intellectually normal versus intellectually impaired children (intelligence quotient <70). Results: We enrolled 171 patients and analyzed 168 as the per-protocol (PP) group (3 patients had protocol violations). The mean age of the PP group was 8.4 ± 2.7 years. The maintenance dose of OXC was 24.9 ± 8.0 mg/kg/day. Of the 168 patients included in the efficacy analysis, 122 (72.6%) completed the study and 94 (56.0%) became seizure-free after the OXC treatment. Comparing the efficacy of OXC for intellectually normal and intellectually impaired patients, 79 (56.8%) of the 139 intellectually normal patients and 15 (51.7%) of the 29 intellectually impaired patients became seizure-free (P = 0.61). After treatment, intelligence scale scores improved in intellectually normal patients compared to the intellectually impaired children (P < 0.05). Social problems quantified by behavior scales improved in intellectually impaired patients compared to intellectually normal children (P < 0.05). Conclusions: OXC is effective and well-tolerated as monotherapy in children with partial seizures.

121,A retrospective comparison of mortality in critically ill hospitalized patients undergoing echocardiography with and without an ultrasound contrast agent,"Objectives: To compare acute mortality in critically ill hospitalized patients undergoing echocardiography with and without an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA). Background: Because of serious cardiopulmonary reactions reported immediately after administration of perflutren-containing UCAs, the FDA required a black box safety warning for this class of agents, including perflutren protein-type A microspheres injectable suspension. Methods: This study used the largest hospital service-level database in the U.S. All adult patients undergoing in-patient echocardiography between January 2003 and October 2005 were identified (n = 2,588,722, of which 22,499 received perflutren protein-type A microspheres injectable suspension). Of the 22,499 contrast echocardiography patients, 2,900 had diagnoses meeting criteria for critical illness (heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, respiratory failure, pulmonary embolism, emphysema, and pulmonary hypertension). To control for the differences between the contrast and noncontrast patients, we used propensity score matching. Variables used in the construction of the propensity score included comorbidities, demographic factors, hospital-specific factors, level of care, and mechanical ventilation status. Patients receiving contrast echocardiography were matched to 4 control patients who received noncontrast echocardiography. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate mortality effects. Results: There were 167 deaths in the study among critically ill patients, 38 of 2,900 from the contrast group and 129 of 11,600 from the control group. The contrast agent was not associated with an increase in same-day mortality (odds ratio: 1.18; 95% confidence interval: 0.82 to 1.71; p = 0.37). Before matching, contrast patients showed greater morbidity than noncontrast patients (Deyo-Charlson comorbidity score 2.45 vs. 2.25, p < 0.0001). After propensity score matching, these differences were significantly reduced, showing that both groups were well balanced. Conclusions: There is no increase in mortality in critically ill patients undergoing echocardiography with the UCA compared with case-matched control patients. © 2010 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",black box warning; Food and Drug Administration; Optison; ultrasound contrast agent,"Exuzides, Alex; Main, Michael L.; Colby, Chris; Grayburn, Paul A.; Feinstein, Steven B.; Goldman, Jonathan H.",2010,10.1016/j.jcmg.2010.04.006,0,114
122,Incidence of and Risk Factors for Severe Adverse Events in Elderly Patients Taking Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors or Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers after an Acute Myocardial Infarction,"Study Objective: To assess the incidence of and risk factors associated with severe adverse events in elderly patients who used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Design: Retrospective cohort study. Data Sources: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse (Medicare service claims database), American Community Survey of the U.S. Census Bureau, and Multum Lexicon Drug database. Patients: A total of 101,588 eligible Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries 66 years or older, who were hospitalized for AMI between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2009, and used ACEIs or ARBs within 30 days after discharge. Measurements and Main Results: Primary outcomes were hospitalizations for acute renal failure (ARF) and hyperkalemia. The secondary outcome was discontinuation or suspension of ACEI/ARB therapy after a visit to a health care provider. The primary risk factors of interest were age, sex, race/ethnicity, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Cumulative incidence curves and multivariable Fine-Gray proportional hazards models with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used with death as a competing risk in both intention-to-treat (ITT) and as-treated (AT) analyses. In the study cohort, 2.8% experienced ARF, 0.5% experienced hyperkalemia, and 63.7% discontinued ACEI/ARB therapy within 1 year after hospital discharge. Approximately half of the incidence of ARF and hyperkalemia occurred within 6 months after hospital discharge, but the cumulative incidence increased after 6 months. Patients older than 85 years had a higher rate of ARF (ITT hazard ratio [HR] 1.15, 95% CI 1.04–1.28) and hyperkalemia (ITT HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05–1.68) compared with those aged 65–74 years. Patients with baseline CKD had higher rates of ARF (ITT HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.42–1.82), hyperkalemia (ITT HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.11–1.77), and ACEI/ARB therapy discontinuation or suspension (ITT HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02–1.09). Conclusion: We found a low incidence of ARF and hyperkalemia in elderly patients treated with ACEIs or ARBs after AMI hospitalization. However, a high rate of treatment discontinuation might prevent a higher rate of occurrence of these events. Long-term careful monitoring of severe adverse events and timely discontinuation of ACEIs or ARBs among elderly patients with advancing age and CKD after an AMI is warranted in clinical practice.",acute kidney injury; acute renal failure; angiotensin II receptor blocker; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; elderly; hyperkalemia; myocardial infarction; secondary prevention; treatment discontinuation,"Fang, Gang; Annis, Izabela E.; Farley, Joel F.; Mahendraratnam, Nirosha; Hickson, Ryan P.; Stürmer, Til; Robinson, Jennifer G.",2018,10.1002/phar.2051,0,115
123,The unique impact of out-of-home placement and the mediating effects of child maltreatment and homelessness on early school success,"Increased national attention has underscored the importance of promoting educational well-being for children who have been placed in out-of-home care. The present study, informed by a developmental epidemiology framework, examined the unique impact of out-of-home placement and the mediating effects of child maltreatment and homelessness on the academic achievement and school adjustment of an entire cohort of second grade children in a large urban school district. Data on birth risks, placement history, child maltreatment, and homelessness from birth through second grade were integrated across municipal agencies for over 11,000 second grade students. Multiple Logistic Regression analyses demonstrate that children with a history of out-of-home placement were at increased risk for poor literacy and science achievement controlling for demographics and birth risks. These children also evidenced significantly higher levels of behavior problems and school suspensions than children with no out-of-home placement history. Maltreatment and homelessness were found to have significant mediating effects on the relationship between out-of-home placement and children's educational well-being. Implications for policy and practice were discussed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

124,Evaluation of Responding in Peaceful and Positive Ways (RIPP): A School-Based Prevention Program for Reducing Violence among Urban Adolescents,Evaluated Responding in Peaceful and Positive Ways (RIPP) - a 6th-grade universal violence prevention program. Classes of 6th graders at 3 urban middle schools serving predominantly African American youth were randomized to intervention (N = 321) and control groups (N = 305). Intervention effects were found on a knowledge test but not on other mediating variables. RIPP participants had fewer disciplinary violations for violent offenses and in-school suspensions at posttest compared with the control group. The reduction in suspensions was maintained at 12-month follow-up for boys but not for girls. RIPP participants also reported more frequent use of peer mediation and reductions in fight-related injuries at posttest. Intervention effects on several measures approached significance at 6-month and 12-month follow-up. The program's impact on violent behavior was more evident among those with high pretest levels of problem behavior.,,"Farrell, Albert D.; Meyer, Aleta L.; White, Kamila S.",2001,10.1207/S15374424JCCP3004_02,0,117
125,"7,8-Dihydroxyflavone reduces sleep during dark phase and suppresses orexin A but not orexin B in mice","Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) binds to Tropomyosin-receptor-kinase B (TrkB) receptors that regulate synaptic strength and plasticity in the mammalian nervous system. 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (DHF) is a recently identified small molecule Trk B agonist that has been reported to ameliorate depression, attenuate the fear response, improve memory consolidation, and exert neuroprotective effects. Poor and disturbed sleep remains a symptom of major depressive disorder and most current antidepressants affect sleep. Therefore, we conducted sleep/wake recordings and concomitant measurement of brain orexins, endogenous peptides that suppress sleep, in mice for this study. Baseline polysomnograph recording was performed for 24 h followed by treatment with either 5 mg/kg of DHF or vehicle at the beginning of the dark phase. Animals were sacrificed the following day, one hour after the final treatment with DHF. Orexin A and B were quantified using ELISA and radioimmunoassay, respectively. Total sleep was significantly decreased in the DHF group, 4 h after drug administration in the dark phase, when compared with vehicle-treated animals. This difference was due to a significant decrease of non-rapid eye movement sleep, but not rapid eye movement sleep. DHF increased power of alpha and sigma bands but suppressed power of gamma band during sleep in dark phase. Interestingly, hypothalamic levels of orexin A were also significantly decreased in the DHF group (97 pg/mg) when compared with the vehicle-treated group (132 pg/mg). However, no significant differences of orexin B were observed between groups. Additionally, no change was found in immobility tests.","7,8-Dihydroxyflavone; BDNF; Depression; Forced swim test; Immobility; Sleep; Tail suspension test; TrkB receptor agonist","Feng, Pingfu; Akladious, Afaf A.; Hu, Yufen; Raslan, Yousef; Feng, James; Smith, Phillip J.",2015,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.08.002,0,118
126,Sexual differences in risk-taking behaviour of the Southern house wren during the nestling rearing stage,"When faced with a predator near the nest, breeding birds faced a dilemma: to continue providing parental care to their offspring exposing themselves to risk or to desert the nest for a brief period of time, exposing their offspring to harm due to the suspension of parental brooding and feeding. In this study, we analysed the response of nesting Southern house wrens (Troglodytes aedon musculus) to a predator model placed near the nest. The experiment was performed in 56 nests when nestling were 3–4 or 10–12 days old. The model (a plastic decoy of the Great Horned Owl Bubo virginianus) was placed at 3 m from the nest. Parent risk-taking was measured as the time elapsed for males and females to resume parental activities during the exposition to the model. We found that males and females delayed parental visits when exposed to the predator model, but females resumed them faster than males, irrespectively of the nesting stage. We also found that males refused to enter to the nest more frequently than females when exposed to the predator model. No effect of breeding experience or nesting stages was noted in the risk taking behaviour of adults. We suggest that sexual differences detected in this species reflect the higher ability of females to cope with the nestling needs and its lower lifetime expectancy.",Brood value; Harm-to-offspring; Life-history traits; Predation risk; Troglodytes,"Fernández, Gustavo J.; Corral, M.

127,Long-term safety and efficacy of levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel in advanced Parkinson's disease,"Background: Levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (designated as carbidopa-levodopa enteral suspension in the United States) provides stable plasma levodopa concentrations and reduces motor fluctuations in advanced Parkinson's disease patients through continuous delivery of levodopa via percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy. We report long-term safety and efficacy outcomes from an open-label phase 3 treatment program. Methods: PD patients (n = 262) who completed a 12-week double-blind study and its 52-week open-label extension or a separate 54-week open-label study were enrolled in this ongoing phase 3 open-label, multinational study (NCT00660673). Safety and efficacy assessments were collected every 6 months. Results: Mean total duration of exposure to levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel was 4.1 years (range, 1.2 to 6.9 years). The overall discontinuation rate was 34% (average annual discontinuation rate, 10%). Although most patients (94%) reported an adverse event, the rate of adverse events decreased over time; 53% experienced a serious adverse event. Of patients in this extension study, 54% required jejunal tube replacement during the study, and 37% required percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube replacement. Most patients were on levodopa monotherapy. Patients maintained reductions in “off” time and increases in mean “on” time without dyskinesia from initial levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion to he study end point (P < 0.001; n = 81). Activities of daily living and quality-of-life assessments demonstrated significant improvements that persisted through the study. Conclusions: This long-term study demonstrates sustained and clinically meaningful benefits from levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel in advanced PD patients. Although adverse event rates decreased over time, vigilance is required for device-related complications and adverse events. © 2018 The Authors.

128,"Tamsulosin for Ureteral Stones in the Emergency Department: A Randomized, Controlled Trial","Study objective: The α-adrenergic antagonist tamsulosin hydrochloride has become an increasingly common adjunct in the treatment of ureteral calculi; however, its efficacy in a general emergency department (ED) population has not been investigated. Methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of adult ED patients with distal ureteral calculi diagnosed by computed tomography scan. Patients were randomized to receive either a 10-day course of ibuprofen and oxycodone plus tamsulosin or ibuprofen and oxycodone alone. The primary outcome measure was successful spontaneous ureteral stone expulsion at 14 days. Secondary outcomes included time to stone passage, self-reported pain scores, number of colicky pain episodes, unscheduled return ED/primary care visits, number of days of missed work/usual function, amount of analgesic used, and adverse events. Results: Eighty subjects were enrolled in the study, with 77 completing the trial. Mean stone size was 3.6 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4 to 3.9). Successful spontaneous stone expulsion at 14 days was similar between the groups, with 27 (77.1%) subjects in the tamsulosin group and 24 (64.9%) subjects in the standard therapy group reporting spontaneous stone passage, a difference of 12% (95% CI -8.4% to 32.8%). At 2-, 5-, and 14-day follow-up, there were no clinically important (or statistically significant) differences between the groups for any secondary outcome measure. No adverse events were reported in either group. Conclusion: In this cohort of adult ED patients with distal ureteral calculi, treatment with tamsulosin did not substantially improve any of the studied outcome measures compared with treatment with ibuprofen and oxycodone alone. © 2009.",,"Ferre, Robinson M.; Wasielewski, Jessica N.; Strout, Tania D.; Perron, Andrew D.",2009,10.1016/j.annemergmed.2008.12.026,0,121
129,"Hyperactive children as young adults: Driving abilities, safe driving behavior, and adverse driving outcomes","ADHD has been linked to poorer driving abilities and greater adverse outcomes (crashes, citations) in clinic-referred cases of teens and adults with ADHD. No study, however, has focused systematically on ADHD children followed into adulthood. The present paper does so while measuring driving-related cognitive abilities, driving behavior, and history of adverse driving outcomes. A multi-method, multi-source battery of driving measures was collected at the young adult follow-up on hyperactive (H; N = 147; mean age = 21.1) and community control children (CC; N = 71; mean age = 20.5) followed for more than 13 years. More of the H than CC groups had been ticketed for reckless driving, driving without a license, hit-and-run crashes, and had their licenses suspended or revoked. Official driving records found more of the H group having received traffic citations and a greater frequency of license suspensions. The cost of damage in their initial crashes was also significantly greater in the H than CC group. Both self-report and other ratings of actual driving behavior revealed less safe driving practices being used by the H group. Observations by driving instructors during a behind-the-wheel road test indicated significantly more impulsive errors. Performance on a simulator further revealed slower and more variable reaction times, greater errors of impulsiveness (false alarms, poor rule following), more steering variability, and more scrapes and crashes of the simulated vehicle against road boundaries in the H than in the CC group. These findings suggest that children growing up with ADHD may either have fewer driving risks or possibly under-report those risks relative to clinic-referred adults with this disorder. Deficits in simulator performance and safe driving behavior, however, are consistent with clinic-referred adults with ADHD suggesting ongoing risks for such adverse driving outcomes in children growing up with ADHD. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

130,Addressing the Early Childhood Mental Health Needs of Young Children: Evaluating Child and Family Outcomes,"The prevalence of serious emotional and behavioral concerns in early childhood is estimated to be in the range of 9% to 14% of the general population (Brauner & Stephens, 2006) and as high as 24% among low-income children (Brown, Copeland, Sucharew, & Kahn, 2012). Unfortunately, mental health concerns among young children often go unidentified and untreated (Breitenstein, Hill, & Gross, 2009). As longer-term research has illustrated the impact of untreated mental health issues in early childhood on later health, social-emotional functioning, and academic success (Zero to Three, 2012), intervention with families facing such concerns offer opportunities to positively impact the trajectory of these issues. Using data from a longitudinal, pre–post design, this secondary analysis examines the delivery (n = 808) and outcomes (n = 664) of child- and family-centered early childhood mental health (ECMH) services delivered in home by 6 agencies. Although ECMH treatment models differed across sites, parents reported significant reductions in children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, and service providers noted significant improvements in parent–child relationship functioning over time, particularly for children with a relationship disorder. Future research using a rigorous experimental design is needed to confirm these preliminary findings.

131,Functions of Aggression and Disciplinary Actions Among Elementary School-Age Youth,"Background: A link between aggression and disciplinary actions has been established; however, specific associations between reactive and proactive functions of aggression and disciplinary actions in the elementary school setting have not been evaluated. A better understanding of links between functions of aggression and disciplinary actions could directly inform whom to target and how to intervene to reduce infractions at school before more serious consequences (i.e., suspension or expulsion) occur. Objective: The present study evaluated unique associations between reactive and proactive aggression and increases in disciplinary actions at school over the course of 1 year. Methods: A sample of 173 elementary school-age youth (ages 8–10, 55.5% female) participated in the current study, with teacher and student reports as well as school record data collected. Results: Correlation analyses indicated that both reactive and proactive aggression were associated with increases in disciplinary actions; however, the magnitude of effects was stronger for reactive aggression. Further, path analyses indicated that when simultaneously evaluating reactive and proactive aggression, only reactive aggression was uniquely positively associated with increases in disciplinary actions. Conclusions: Reactive aggression appears to be the function of aggression to target for the prevention of disciplinary actions in the elementary school setting.

132,"Oropharyngeal candidiasis in immunocompromised children: A randomized, multicenter study of orally administered fluconazole suspension versus nystatin","Objective: To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerance of fluconazole suspension versus nystatin in the treatment of oropharyngeal thrush in immunocompromised children. Design: Multicenter, randomized, observer-masked trial. Setting: Thirty-two centers participated, including hospitals and ambulatory care clinics. Patients: We enrolled 182 immunocompromised infants and children, ages 5 months to 14 years, with signs of oral thrush and presence of yeasts on potassium hydroxide- or gram-stained preparations. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single daily dose of fluconazole suspension, 2 to 3 mg/kg per day, or nystatin, 400,000 units four times daily for 14 days; 159 patients, who had culture confirmation of thrush and received at least 7 days of study drug, were evaluated for efficacy; all patients were evaluated for safety. Results: Clinical cure was demonstrated in 91% of the subjects in the fluconazole group and 51% of the subjects in the nystatin group (p <0.001), and eradication of the organism cultured at entry occurred in 76% and 11% (p <0.001), respectively. Gastrointestinal conditions developed in six patients who received fluconazole and in three who received nystatin; two fluconazole recipients were subsequently withdrawn from the study. Laboratory abnormalities occurred with equal frequency in both groups. Clinical relapse rates were similar in both groups at 2 weeks (18% and 24% for fluconazole and nystatin, respectively) and 1 month (28% and 27%, respectively) after the completion of study drug. Conclusions:Fluconazole suspension is more effective than nystatin in the treatment of thrush in immunocompromised children. Both regimens were well tolerated.

133,Safety of insertion of the copper IUD and LNG-IUS in nulliparous women: a systematic review,"Objective: Intrauterine contraception (IUC) is one of the more effective contraceptive methods for women at highest risk of unintended pregnancy. This includes younger, often nulliparous, women; however, uptake has been relatively low in this group. Methods: In February 2017 we conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials, prospective and retrospective observational studies to identify barriers to IUC use in nulliparous women. Results: Study quality was poor. No differences in rates of infection or expulsions between nulliparous and parous were seen. Fertility rates following removal appeared no different from the general population. Higher rates insertion difficulty, insertion failure and pain during insertion were observed in nulliparous women. Conclusion: A long-acting reversible contraceptive method such as IUC reduces the risk of unintended pregnancy since user failure is minimised. Evidence-based information about the advantages and disadvantages of IUC is required to inform decision-making and dispel any myths and misperceptions. Potential barriers to IUC use in nulliparous women, particularly concerns around infection, significantly higher rates of device expulsion and adverse effects on fertility, do not appear to be justified. IUC is appropriate for all medically-eligible women, including nulliparous women, and should be included in the range of contraceptive options discussed during counselling.",Fertility; infection; intrauterine contraceptive devices; intrauterine device complications; intrauterine device expulsion; pain; parity,"Foran, Therese; Butcher, Belinda E.; Kovacs, Gab; Bateson, Deborah; O’Connor, Vivienne",2018,10.1080/13625187.2018.1526898,0,126
134,The relationship between exclusion from school and mental health: A secondary analysis of the British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Surveys 2004 and 2007,"Background Children with poor mental health often struggle at school. The relationship between childhood psychiatric disorder and exclusion from school has not been frequently studied, but both are associated with poor adult outcomes. We undertook a secondary analysis of the British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Surveys from 2004 and its follow-up in 2007 to explore the relationship between exclusion from school and psychopathology. We predicted poorer mental health among those excluded. Method Psychopathology was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, while psychiatric disorder was assessed using the Development and Well-Being Assessment and applying Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM IV) criteria. Exclusion from school and socio-demographic characteristics were reported by parents. Multi-variable regression models were used to examine the impact of individual factors on exclusion from school or psychological distress. Results Exclusion from school was commoner among boys, secondary school pupils and those living in socio-economically deprived circumstances. Poor general health and learning disability among children and poor parental mental health were also associated with exclusion. There were consistently high levels of psychological distress among those who had experienced exclusion at baseline and follow-up. Conclusions We detected a bi-directional association between psychological distress and exclusion. Efforts to identify and support children who struggle with school may therefore prevent both future exclusion and future psychiatric disorder.",Epidemiology; exclusion; psychiatric disorder; psychopathology; school,"Ford, T.; Parker, C.; Salim, J.; Goodman, R.; Logan, S.; Henley, W.",2018,10.1017/S003329171700215X,0,127

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals with type 1 diabetes (n = 103, age 6-72 years, mean HbA1c 7.3% [56 mmol/mol]) participated in a 6-week randomized crossover trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a Tandem Diabetes Care t:slim X2 pump with Basal-IQ integrated with a Dexcom G5 sensor and a predictive low-glucose suspend algorithm (PLGS) compared with sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy. The primary outcome was CGM-measured time <70 mg/dL. RESULTS: Both study periods were completed by 99% of participants; median CGM usage exceeded 90% in both arms. Median time <70 mg/dL was reduced from 3.6% at baseline to 2.6% during the 3-week period in the PLGS arm compared with 3.2% in the SAP arm (difference [PLGS 2 SAP] = 20.8%, 95% CI 21.1 to 20.5, P < 0.001). The corresponding mean values were 4.4%, 3.1%, and 4.5%, respectively, representing a 31% reduction in the time <70 mg/dL with PLGS. There was no increase in mean glucose concentration (159 vs. 159 mg/dL, P = 0.40) or percentage of time spent >180 mg/dL (32% vs. 33%, P = 0.12). One severe hypoglycemic event occurred in the SAP arm and none in the PLGS arm. Mean pump suspension time was 104 min/day.

Study Design: Subjects scheduled for transvaginal, outpatient surgery were consecutively enrolled and randomized to backfill-assisted voiding trial or a trial of spontaneous voiding after surgery. Results: Sixty subjects were enrolled. The mean time in the perioperative anesthesia care unit for the backfill group was 199.5 minutes vs 226.6 minutes in the spontaneous voiding group (P = .08). Subjects randomized to backfill were more likely to adequately empty their bladders and be discharged home without catheter drainage than subjects in the spontaneous voiding group (61.5% vs 32.1%, respectively, P = .02). Multiple logistic regression further demonstrated that the backfill-assisted technique predicted successful bladder emptying after vaginal surgery (P = .02).

137,The impact of early school behavior and educational achievement on adult drug use disorders: A prospective study,"Few longitudinal studies have examined the effects of education on drug use disorders among community populations of African Americans. This study explores the impact of multiple early education indicators on later problem drug use in an African American population followed for more than 35 years. The initial cohort comprised all 1st graders (N = 1242, 51% female) living in the Woodlawn community of Chicago in 1966. Follow-up assessments were conducted in adolescence (1975-76), early adulthood (1992-93), and mid adulthood (2002-03). One or both adult interviews were completed by 1053 individuals providing information for identifying lifetime drug use disorders. Logistic regression with multiple imputation revealed several important relationships between early education indicators and DSM-III-R/DSM-IV drug use disorders. Specifically, the risk for adult problem drug use was related to: underachievement in 1st grade; low 7th and 8th grade standardized math scores; both suspension from and skipping school in adolescence; not having a high school diploma (compared to having a college degree), and having a diploma or GED (compared to having a college degree). Also, 1st graders characterized as shy by their teachers were less likely to develop problem drug use in adulthood. Results indicate potential opportunities for targeted intervention at multiple life stages. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

138,Evaluation of chlorhexidine hydrochloride treatment on endometrial health of normal mares,"Chlorhexidine gluconate solution is a potent antimicrobial and therefore could be used effectively for treatment of endometritis, but historically this substance has been implicated as irritating to mucous membranes, including the endometrium of the mare. The use of chlorhexidine hydrochloride suspension (Nolvasan Suspension, Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ, USA) was evaluated in the uterus of normal mares to determine if adverse effects on endometrial health were noted. Twelve healthy, adult light breed mares were included in this study. Procedures were approved by the Auburn University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All mares were determined to be reproductively normal by evaluation of endometrial histopathology, cytology, and bacterial culture. Mares were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups (n = 6 per group). Each mare was treated during estrus with an intrauterine infusion of 1 g (28 mLs per tube; 35.7 mg/mL) of chlorhexidine hydrochloride suspension (treatment group) or an equal volume of lactated ringer's solution (control group) once daily for 3 consecutive days. Biopsy and cytology samples were taken 3, 7, and 14 days after completion of treatment. Cytology and biopsy samples were read by a board-certified pathologist (L.N.) blinded to treatments, and biopsy samples were graded using a standardized Kenney-Doig score. There was no difference with respect to biopsy grade, degree of endometrial fibrosis, or presence of cytologic inflammation comparing control and treatment groups (P = 0.55, 0.7, and 0.06, respectively), neither when accounting for sampling day. The suspension was visible within the uterine lumen when mares were examined with transrectal ultrasonography for up to 4 days after treatment.

139,Health-care utilization and outcomes of patients at high risk of invasive fungal infection,"Purpose: The objectives of this study were to present trends in posaconazole use over time and describe selected outcomes among patients at high risk of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) by use and type of antifungal medicine. Methods: A retrospective observational study using data from the Premier Healthcare Database between January 2007 and March 2016 was conducted. Inpatient use of posaconazole by formulation and year is described. Separately, four cohorts of patients at high risk of IFI – those with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), and graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) – but without a diagnosis code for IFI during the index encounter were identified as potential candidates for antifungal prophylaxis. Use of antifungal medication(s) in these patients was categorized. Index length of stay (LOS), index hospital costs, and subsequent inpatient and outpatient encounters with IFI at 30, 60, and 90 days post-index encounter are presented by antifungal group for each cohort. The percentage of patients with inpatient and outpatient encounters with IFI at 90 days post-index encounter was determined for each cohort by year. Results: Use of posaconazole oral suspension increased through 2012, then declined as the tablet formulation became available in 2013. A total of 19,872 AML patients, 12,125 MDS patients, 14,220 HSCT patients, and 5,431 GVHD patients were considered potential candidates for antifungal prophylaxis; however, a large proportion of patients within each cohort (33%–94%) did not receive any antifungal drug during the index hospitalization. Index LOS, hospital costs, and subsequent encounters for IFI varied among cohorts and by antifungal group. Within each cohort, subsequent encounters for IFI at 90 days post-index encounter fluctuated but remained rare across different years.

141,Youth suicide: A psychological autopsy study of completers and controls,"The objective of this study was to investigate risk factors that could help to differentiate between 14-25-year-old suicide attempters who survive the attempt and those who do not. Using a case-control psychological autopsy method, 29 cases (completers) and 23 controls (survivors) matched for age and sex were included. Survivors, parents and a close friend participated independently in semistructured interviews. Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia Lifetime, stress scales, medical records and a sociodemographic inventory were used to reach a consensus best estimate DSM-IV five-axis diagnosis for each subject. A conditional logistic regression was used with the PHREG procedure in SAS to investigate the relationship between the binary outcome (survival/death) and the set of putative risk factors. No significant Axis I diagnostic differences were found between groups. Based on odds ratios, school suspension and irritability provide the best predictive factors for survival. Together with an Axis II cluster C diagnosis (avoidant, dependent and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder), high Global Assessment of Functioning scale, reactivity of depressed mood and level of obsessions were associated significantly with suicide completers. Cases appear to show more of an 'internalizer' profile, compared to controls who were more of the 'externalizer' profile. Dissatisfaction with physical appearance, rejection from others and feelings of isolation were highly prevalent in all subjects. Seventy-two per cent of cases died on their first attempt. The vast majority of subjects sought general medical care in the months preceding the suicidal behaviour. A mental health professional was consulted within the previous year by a greater proportion of controls, compared with cases. Our research emphasizes that the combination of psychopathology (diagnosed or not) and previous high level of functioning (in individuals who internalize their conflicts) represents an at-risk group for youth completing suicide. These findings underscore the importance of mental health evaluation as part of the general medical care assessment.",Attempters; Psychological autopsy; Risk factors; Suicide; Youth,"Gagnon, André; Davidson, Simon I.; Cheifetz, Philip N.; Martineau, Marc; Beauchamp, Guy",2009,10.1080/17450120802270400,0,133
142,State-level analysis of school punitive discipline practices in Florida,"The purpose of this study was to identify statewide trends in school approaches to student discipline and examine the associations between punitive discipline practices and student, school, and local education agency (LEA) characteristics. In addition, we compared punitive disciplinary practices for schools and LEAs that do and do not allow corporal punishment. Publicly available data from the 2010–2011 Florida Department of Education and Common Core of Data were used to assess associations between (a) punitive discipline practices (i.e., suspensions, expulsions, restraints, corporal punishment, and changes of placement) and student characteristics (i.e., grade level, gender, and race), (b) punitive discipline practices (without corporal punishment) and school and LEA characteristics, and (c) school use of corporal punishment and school and LEA characteristics. Results of descriptive comparisons, tests of association, and multilevel regression analyses indicated that schools with higher ratios of (a) students receiving free and reduced lunch and (b) Black or African American students more frequently employed punitive discipline practices, and that punitive discipline practices were disproportionately used with males and Black or African American students.

143,Analysis of the use of fortified medium in continuous culture of mammalian cells,"Continuous culture is frequently used in the cultivation of mammalian cells for the manufacturing of recombinant protein pharmaceuticals. In such operations a large volume of medium is turned over each day, especially in the case where cell recycle, or perfusion cultivation, is practiced. In principle, the volumetric throughout Of medium can be reduced by using a more concentrated feed while maintaining the same nutrient provision rate. Overall, the medium components are divided into two categories: 'consumable nutrients' and 'unconsumable inorganic bulk salts'. In such fortified medium, the concentrations of consumable nutrients, but not bulk salts, are increased. With a stoichiometrically-balanced medium, the large amount of nutrients fed into the culture is largely consumed by cells to give rise to residual concentrations of these nutrients in their optimal range. However, unless care is taken to initiate the continuous culture, overshoot of nutrients may occur during the transient period. The high nutrient concentration during overshoot may be inhibitory by itself, or the resulting high osmolality may retard the growth. Using a mathematical model that incorporates the growth inhibitory effect of high osmolality we demonstrate such a potentially catastrophic effect of nutrient and osmolality overshoot by simulation. To avoid overshoot a controlled nutrient feeding scheme should be devised at the initiation of continuous culture.",Continuous culture; Growth inhibition; Osmolality; Perfusion culture,"Gambhir, Anshu; Zhang, Chun; Europa, Anna; Hu, Wei Shou",1999,10.1023/A:1008026613975,0,135
144,"Selection Into, and Academic Benefits From, Middle School Dance Elective Courses Among Urban Youth","Although research shows associations between adolescents general arts involvement and academic performance, little research documents links between enrollment in middle school dance elective courses and academic achievement, especially within low-income, urban populations. Further, differences between adolescents who do and do not have access to, or self-select into, middle school dance electives have yet to be identified. We prospectively followed a large (n = 31,332), ethnically diverse sample of children from preschool through 8th grade in Miami, Florida. About 7% of adolescents enrolled in a dance elective course at some point in middle school (6th- 8th grade), with the majority of those (68.8%) taking dance for only one year. Black students were more likely than White and Latinx students to attend middle schools that did not offer dance. When dance courses were available, males and Black students were less likely to select into a dance elective. Students who took dance in middle school showed greater initial social skills at age four and better prior academic achievement in elementary school compared with those who did not take dance. Importantly, controlling for all preexisting selection effects and prior academic achievement, dance engagement in middle school was associated with higher grade point averages and standardized test scores, better school attendance, and a lower likelihood of suspension during middle school, with stronger positive effects observed for taking dance electives for multiple years.

147,Using the Teaching and Guidance Policy Essentials Checklist to Build and Support Effective Early Childhood Systems,"The prevalence of preschool expulsion, coupled with racial disparities in expulsion rates and the potential long term negative effects of challenging behaviors in the early years, has created an urgent need to build early childhood systems to address these issues. The teaching and guidance policy essentials checklist (TAG-PEC) has been developed to assess nine essential features of high quality early childhood discipline policies and can be used by early childhood programs in a variety of settings to evaluate, refine, and revise existing policies or guide in the development of new policies. Using data from 282 guidance policies assessed using the TAG-PEC, the authors use a framework for systems building developed by Coffman (A framework for evaluating systems initiatives, 2007) to position the TAG-PEC as a powerful tool that can be used to help build and support an effective and cohesive early childhood system. Findings indicate that, overall, discipline policies were not high quality and there was a great deal of variability in the TAG-PEC scores. By bringing evidence based practices to the field via a simple to use checklist, the authors hope to help contribute to the development of a comprehensive early childhood system and that supports programs in the provision of high quality services to children and families.",Challenging behavior; Child guidance; Discipline policies; Early childhood systems,"Garrity, Sarah M.; Longstreth, Sascha L.; Salcedo-Potter, Nina S.; Staub, April",2016,10.1007/s10643-015-0713-6,0,139
148,A Consultation Approach to Target Exclusionary Discipline of Students of Color in Early Childhood Education,"Black students comprise approximately 19% of the preschool population, yet they represent 47% of school suspensions (U.S. Department of Education 2016). Although it is posited that most teachers seek to serve all children to the best of their abilities, research indicates that many school personnel engage in implicit biases that influence their perceptions, behaviors, and interactions with students (Boser et al. 2014). Studies have also found that racial ethnic minority status influences the quality of individual education and level of access to fair and appropriate accommodations a student receives (Farkas Teachers College",,"Garro, Adrienne; Giordano, Keri; Gubi, Aaron; Shortway, Kendahl",2021,10.1007/s40688-019-00258-9,1,140
149,"Isolation and characterization of an early T-helper/inducer cell line with a unique pattern of surface phenotype, constitutive cytokine secretion and myc oncogene expression","The cell line AG-F was isolated from the marrow of a neuroblastoma patient undergoing myeloablative treatment and autologous bone marrow rescue. A year later, the patient developed a Hodgkin's type lymphoma. AG-F cell line demonstrated an unusual phenotype, lacking surface CD2 and CD3, but expressing high levels of CD4, CD5, CD7, CD29, and CD45RO. Markers associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma cells, CD15 and CD30, were also positive. AG-F cells grow in suspension in clusters of 50-200 cells, with a doubling time of 9 h. They can also grow in serum-free medium and form tumors in nude mice. AG-F cells have amplified N-myc and c-myc and high levels of the corresponding mRNA transcripts. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a DNA index by flow cytometry of near tetraploid cells and a karyotype of 85-87 chromosomes, with consistent abnormalities in chromosomes 1, 5, and 9. Gene rearrangement studies revealed rearrangement of the beta gene of the T-cell receptor. AG-F cells secrete high levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and GM-CSF. Cell adherence and formation of long processes could be induced by fibronectin and were enhanced by exposure to PMA. Cells exposed to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) had increased expression of CD11a, CD11b, CD18, CD45RO, and HLA-DR, whereas expression of CD15 and CD30 was markedly decreased. Similarly, the level of c-myc and N-myc oncoproteins and the levels of the cytoskeletal proteins, actin, tubulin, and vimentin markedly decreased early after PMA-induced differentiation.",,"Gazitt, Yair; He, Yun Ju; Shults, Keith; Stelzer, Gregory T.; Cohen, Robert J.",1993,,0,141
150,Method for autologous single skin cell isolation for regenerative cell spray transplantation with non-cultured cells,"Background: There is a therapeutic gap for patients with deep partial-thickness wounds (Grade IIb) of moderate size that were initially not treated with split- or mesh grafting to avoid overgrafting, but developed delayed wound healing around two weeks after injury - at which time grafting is typically not indicated anymore. Delayed wound healing is often associated with esthetically unsatisfactory results and sometimes functional problems. An innovative cell isolation method for cell spray transplantation at the point of care, which eliminates cell culture prior to treatment, was implemented for this population of burn patients in our center. Methods: Autologous skin cell spray transplantation was initiated by taking healthy skin. The dermal/epi- dermal layers were separated using enzymatic digestion with 40 min dispase application, followed by 15 min trypsin application for basal kerationcyte isolation, 7 min cell washing by centrifugation, followed by transferring the cells for spraying into Ringer lactate solution. The procedure was performed on site in a single session immediately following the biopsy. After sharp wound debridement, cells were immediately transplanted by deposition with a cell sprayer for even distribution of the cell suspension. Results and conclusions: Eight patients were treated (mean age 30.3 years, mean burn total body surface area 14%, mean Abbreviated Burn Severity Index (5 points). The mean time to complete re-epithelialization was 12.6 days. All patients exhibited wound healing with improved esthetic and functional quality. Our initial experience for the use of non-cultured cells using a two-enzyme approach with cell washing suggests shortened time for wound closure, suggesting that the method may potentially avoid longer-term complications. © 2011 Wichtig Editore.",Burns; Isolation; Keratinocytes; Spraying; Transplantation,"Gerlach, Jörg C.; Johnen, Christa; Ottoman, Chrtian; Bräutigam, Kirsten; Plettig, Jörn; Belfekroun, Claudia; Münch, Sandra; Hartmann, Bernd",2011,10.5301/IJAO.2011.6508,0,142
151,Exclusions: What the Children Think,"During the past few years there has been increasing concern about the number of pupils being excluded from school, the process of exclusion itself and the effects of exclusion upon the educational careers of young people. The over representation of pupils from the black and ethnic minority community in the population of excluded pupils has also been remistered as a major area of concern. This paper aims to highlight some of the recent developments and key issues, to describe a small scale empirical study which examined the views of pupils excluded from school, and to propose some practical implications for future development. These include a booklet for students who have been excluded from school and an advice leaflet for parents. It is the underlying thesis of this paper that more studies are required to elicit the views of pupils themselves about the experience and effects of exclusion, perhaps utilising the sort of qualitative methodologies depicted in this paper, and furthermore, that pupils could and should play a more active role in the planning process than is currently the case. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

153,Caregivers' moral narratives of their African American children's out-of-school suspensions: Implications for effective family-school collaborations,"In this qualitative study, the authors examined the culturally nuanced meanings of out-of-school suspensions for 30 lower income caregivers of African American children suspended from school. Caregivers were invited to describe their experiences of their children's suspensions during in-depth, individual, audiotaped interviews. Caregivers generally valued their children's school success, recognized when their children had misbehaved, and supported educators' imposition of appropriate consequences. Out-of-school suspensions, however, were rarely viewed as appropriate consequences. On the contrary, caregivers produced emotionally laden moral narratives that generally characterized their children's suspensions as unjust; harmful to children; negligent in helping children with underlying problems such as bullying; undermining parents' racial socialization; and, in general, racially problematic. Suspensions also contributed to some families' withdrawal from participation in their schools. Understanding how caregivers experience children's out-of-school suspensions provides important clues to how families and schools can work together to effectively reduce racial disparities in out-of-school suspensions. © 2013 National Association of Social Workers.","African Americans, caregivers' narratives; out-of-school suspensions; social injustice","Gibson, Priscilla A.; Haight, Wendy",2013,10.1093/sw/swt017,1,144
154,Enough is enough: Grandmother caregivers' strategies for mitigating out-of-school suspensions for African-American youth,"This qualitative study explores the strategies used by grandmothers caring for African-American grandchildren with out-of-school suspensions drawing from a larger study of caregivers. In-depth, semi-structured, individual interviews with 10 grandmothers who were caring for a total of 13 grandchildren with a range of 1 to 14 out-of-school suspensions (OSS) revealed that these grandmother caregivers took action with both their grandchildren and the grandchildren' s educators. Grandmothers became intensely involved with school and in-home educational activities. They structured their relationship with their grandchildren to attend to affection, provide incentives and respond with appropriate consequences. Additionally, grandmothers identified services and programs received and needed to enhance the grandchildren' s engagement with the learning process. Furthermore, based on strong opinions about changes needed in the schools, they provided concrete recommendations to educators. These recommendations call for professionals to support grandmothers' actions to reduce OSS and advocate to educators to revise policies and procedures that would promote a better understanding of grandchildren in the care of their grandmothers and the efforts that these grandmothers make to mitigate OSS. © 2013.",African-American students; Grandmother caregivers; Out-of-school suspensions,"Gibson, Priscilla A.; McGlynn, Cara",2013,10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.08.004,1,145
155,Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation: Results of a Statewide Random-Controlled Evaluation,"Objective Despite recent federal recommendations calling for increased funding for early childhood mental health consultation (ECMHC) as a means to decrease preschool expulsions, no randomized-controlled evaluations of this form of intervention have been reported in the scientific literature. This study is the first attempt to isolate the effects of ECMHC for enhancing classroom quality, decreasing teacher-rated behavior problems, and decreasing the likelihood of expulsion in targeted children in early childhood classrooms. Method The sample consisted of 176 target children (3–4 years old) and 88 preschool classrooms and teachers randomly assigned to receive ECMHC through Connecticut's statewide Early Childhood Consultation Partnership (ECCP) or waitlist control treatment. Before randomization, teachers selected 2 target children in each classroom whose behaviors most prompted the request for ECCP. Evaluation measurements were collected before and after treatment, and child behavior and social skills and overall quality of the childcare environment were assessed. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to evaluate the effectiveness of ECCP and to account for the nested structure of the study design. Results Children who received ECCP had significantly lower ratings of hyperactivity, restlessness, externalizing behaviors, problem behaviors, and total problems compared with children in the control group even after controlling for gender and pretest scores. No effects were found on likelihood of expulsion and quality of childcare environment. Conclusion ECCP resulted in significant decreases across several domains of teacher-rated externalizing and problem behaviors and is a viable and potentially cost-effective means for infusing mental health services into early childhood settings.

156,Teacher decision factors that lead to preschool expulsion: Scale development and preliminary validation of the preschool expulsion risk measure,"Preschool expulsion is a trending social problem. To date, this is the first study that examines the teacher decision factors behind preschool expulsions. This article presents results of the development and validation of the Preschool Expulsion Risk Measure (PERM). In a 2-phase analysis of the study, we provide evidence for the PERM’s reliability and validity in a sample of 352 preschoolers from 88 sites in a New England state. The PERM yielded 4 factors (classroom disruption, fear of accountability, hopelessness, and teacher stress) and demonstrated good internal consistency. The PERM correlated with standardized assessments of children’s behavior problems and predicted intervention status (target child vs. random peer) and the probability of expulsion (child considered for expulsion vs. child never considered for expulsion). Classroom disruption predicted intervention status whereas accountability predicted consideration for expulsion. Results support the PERM as a viable tool for assessing the propensity to be expelled. Findings shed light into the decision factors that propel teachers to consider expulsion of a child, which can inform early education programs and policies to address this issue.

157,Preschool and child care expulsion and suspension: Rates and predictors in one state,"Rates and predictors of preschool expulsion and suspension were examined in a randomly selected sample of Massachusetts preschool teachers (N ≤ 119). During a 12-month period, 39% of teachers reported expelling at least one child, and 15% reported suspending. The preschool expulsion rate was 27.42 per 1000 enrollees, more than 34 times the Massachusetts K-12 rate and more than 13 times the national K-12 rate. Suspension rates for preschoolers were less than that for K-12. Larger classes, higher proportion of 3-year-olds in the class, and elevated teacher job stress predicted increased likelihood of expulsion. Location in a school or Head Start and teachers' positive feelings of job satisfaction predicted decreased likelihood of expulsion. Expulsion was relatively rare in classes where both class size and teacher job stress were low. A higher proportion of Latino children in the class and lower teacher job satisfaction predicted an increased likelihood of suspension.

Measured risk activities were crossing a suspension bridge without holding the safety handrails and entering exits of tube chutes that had posted pictorial and print warning signs. Proportional to the overall frequencies of boys and girls entering these exhibits, significant differences were observed at both the suspension bridge for boys (132/203) and girls (79/184), X2 (1, N = 387) = 18.99, p < .001, one-tailed) and the tube chutes for boys (34/179) and girls (14/159), X2 (1, N = 338) = 7.176, p< .01, one-tailed). Boys engaged in more physical risk behaviors than girls. These findings were consistent with natural observations reported at similar zoo exhibits two decades earlier suggesting that, unlike self-reported risk-taking data, the magnitude of sex differences in children's physical risk-taking may not have diminished over time. © NAJP.",,"Ginsburg, Harvey J.; Rogerson, Kimberly; Voght, Elizabeth; Walters, Jennifer; Bartels, Roger D.",2007,,0,149
159,Associations Between Child and Administrator Race and Suspension and Expulsion Rates in Community Childcare Programs,"Suspension is defined as a temporary removal from the educational setting where a child is able to return after a determined period of time, while expulsion is the complete and permanent removal of a child from an entire educational system (Gilliam and Shahar 2006). Preschool children have been found to be both suspended and expelled at higher rates than school-aged children (Cutler and Gilkerson 2002; Gilliam 2005; Gilliam and Shahar 2006). It has been reported that 50,000 preschoolers were suspended at least once; another 17,000 were estimated to have been expelled (Malik 2017). However, much of this information had been collected from public preschool programs. Although many factors contribute to the high suspension and expulsion rates of young children, race has risen to the forefront as a possible contributing correlate to disproportionality (Kunesh and Noltemeyer 2019; U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights 2016a, b). More specifically, children of color have been found to be at increased risk for being suspended and expelled (U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights 2016a, b). In addition to addressing the gap in research by reporting suspension and expulsion data from one state’s community childcare centers, this paper also examines the disproportionality of suspensions and expulsions in these programs.

A prospective, descriptive case series study with historical controls was conducted to examine clinical outcomes and user feedback when nonpowered, ergonomically designed, high-specification foam (HSF) devices were added to either a medical grade portable recliner or standard hospital bed used in the care of persons at high risk for pressure ulcers (PU). The study was conducted in a hospice agency and a VA rehabilitation and long-termcare unit. Eligible participants were mobility and/or activity impaired; had at least one comorbidity; received standardized skin hygiene, incontinence, and repositioning protocols; and/or had previously documented negative outcomes (eg, pain or discomfort associated with sitting or lying surfaces, falls from equipment, nonhealing PU, and posturing problems such as leaning, sliding, or slumping) on currently used support surfaces. Patients/caregivers ranked pretrial and trial surface performance for overall comfort, control of downward migration, overall immersion, support while sitting without bottoming-out or hammocking, and heel offloading as evidenced by suspension or total immersion of the foot and ankle. Follow-up variables, including changes in pain, discomfort, PU status (if present), and skin integrity, were obtained every 7 to 21 days. Forty-four (44) persons (24 men, 20 women; average age 79, range 47-98 years) participated in the mattress study for an average of 53 (range 3-120) days); and 33 (eight men, 25 women; average age 82, range 63 to 97 years) participated in the recliner support system evaluation, for an average of 39 days (range 13-66 days). Compared to prestudy surfaces, perceived comfort, migration, immersion, and heel offloading ratings were significantly higher for the mattress and recliner surface (P < 0.05). No falls occurred, and 17 of 35 preexisting PU in the mattress and 17 of 20 PU in the seating surface group healed. Two of 26 hospice patients developed a new end-of-life, Stage II PU after day 48 of the mattress trial. No new PU developed in the seating trial. These results suggest randomized comparative studies comparing these nonpowered HSF chair and bed surfaces to other commonly used support surfaces are warranted. © 2014 Ostomy Wound Management.",geriatrics; clinical study; hospice; mattresses; pressure ulcer; seating,"Girolami, Susan; Moore, Angelene; Haper, Casey; Betts, Connie; Woodward, Tracey",2014,,0,153
163,Review article: Epidemiology and management of gastro-oesophageal reflux in children,"The management of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) continues to garner vast amounts of attention among physicians who care for adults. However, there is an increasing awareness of the fact that this disease, as well as several other lifelong digestive diseases (i.e. Crohn's disease) may actually have their origins in childhood. Paediatric gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is likely to share a similar pathophysiology to adult GER, and mounting evidence from published preliminary data suggests a genetic susceptibility to GERD. However, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. In children, GER has a distinct presentation from that in adults, with the diagnostic work-up based upon the patient's age as well as their presenting signs and symptoms. Like their adult counterparts, the early detection and treatment of GER in children may result in a better long-term outcome, improved quality-of-life, and a reduction in overall healthcare burden. While the treatment of GER in infants tends to be conservative (i.e. positioning during feeding, smaller feedings), its management in older children parallels that of adults and includes lifestyle changes and pharmacological therapy. However, with persistent symptoms, acid suppression is the mainstay of GERD management in both children and adults. Several studies in children have verified that acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor is superior to histamine-2 receptor antagonists. Among the proton pump inhibitors, both lansoprazole and omeprazole have been the subject of published adult and paediatric studies demonstrating their short and long-term safety, in addition to their efficacy in a variety of oesophageal and supra-oesophageal GERD related conditions. These two proton pump inhibitors are manufactured as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be emptied into soft foods or liquids without compromising their pharmacological effects or pharmacokinetic properties. Lansoprazole is also available as a strawberry-flavoured suspension that is acceptable to children and as an oral disintegrating tablet.",,"Gold, B. D.",2004,10.1111/j.0953-0673.2004.01832.x,0,154
164,Gastroesophageal reflux disease: could intervention in childhood reduce the risk of later complications?,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is a ubiquitous disorder in infants. Whereas infants typically outgrow regurgitation by 1 year of age, the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms in those aged 3 to >18 years ranges from 1.8% to 22%. The pathophysiology of GERD in children is similar to that in adults. However, children may present with gastroesophageal and extraesophageal symptoms distinct from classic heartburn. In addition to a growing awareness of the high prevalence of the disorder, increasing evidence supports GERD being a lifelong condition in some individuals that begins in childhood. Although the diagnostic workup in children compared with adults may differ, studies suggest that the early detection and treatment of GERD in childhood may result in better adult disease outcomes, improved quality of life, and decreased overall healthcare burden. Studies of proton pump inhibitor therapy in children confirm high rates of mucosal healing and GER symptom resolution, even in children whose symptoms did not respond to H2-receptor therapy or fundoplication procedures. Omeprazole, lansoprazole, and esomeprazole are formulated as capsules containing enteric-coated granules that can be sprinkled onto applesauce or other soft foods. Lansoprazole is also formulated as strawberry-flavored granules for suspension. These as well as other alternative dosing formulations expand the ability to administer these agents to children. Moreover, long-term studies in adults and in children demonstrate that these agents are safe and well tolerated, even at the higher milligram per kilogram doses that are often required in pediatric patients because of their greater hepatic metabolic capacity.",,"Gold, Benjamin D.",2004,10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.07.014,0,155
165,When there is no blueprint: The provision of mental health services in alternative school programs for suspended and expelled youth,"A variety of alternative programs are being implemented in Canada and the United States for students who have exhibited conduct problems and who are suspended or expelled from their schools. Given the complexity of issues that these students frequently face, treatment must be multifaceted, wrap-around, delivered by trained professionals and be targeted to these students' unique biopsychosocial needs. This article reviews the literature on delivery of mental health services within the broader school-based context. Specific mental health issues endemic in the high-risk adolescent demographic are highlighted, and implications for mental health professionals, particularly psychologists, working with such individuals are discussed. Suggestions are made with respect to screening and assessment instruments and treatment. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Alternative programs; Assessment and treatment; High-risk youth; Mental health; Psychologists; Screening; Suspended and expelled students; Wrap-around,"Goldenson, Julie",2011,10.1080/0145935X.2011.581958,1,156
166,Associations between participation in family activities and adolescent school problems,"Introduction: Adolescent risk outcomes related to school issues are widespread, with about 20% parents reporting poor school engagement amongst their youth. Previous literature suggests that adolescents who report strong bonds with their parents are often identified as being less likely to engage in risky behaviours, such as substance use. The current study sought to examine the association between the frequencies of selected family activities and school problems amongst adolescents after adjustments for family connectedness and other characteristics. Methods: Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997. Of the 8984 youth interviewed, 3855 also had a sibling interviewed who met the selection criteria. School problem outcomes measured were suspension occurrence, poor grades and highest grade completed low for age. Independent variables of interest were self-reported frequency of family dinner, fun and religious activities in a typical week. Multivariable logistic models were estimated for each outcome, and multivariable linear probability models were estimated adjusting for family fixed effects. Results: Adjusting for family connectedness, there were significant associations between certain family activities and adolescent school problem measures. However, these results did not remain significant in models with family fixed effects, suggesting that associations could be driven by family-level confounders. Discussion: This study did not find strong evidence of a protective relationship between family activities and school problems. Therefore, it suggested that programme and policymakers be cautious in overstating the importance of family activities in preventing adolescent risk outcomes until true causal relationships can be determined.",adolescent behaviour; family activity(ies); family dinner; school problems,"Goldfarb, S.

167,"Phase IB study of selinexor, a first-in-class inhibitor of nuclear export, in patients with advanced refractory bone or soft tissue sarcoma","Purpose: We evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PKs), pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy of selinexor, an oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export compound, in patients with advanced soft tissue or bone sarcoma with progressive disease. Patients and Methods: Fifty-four patients were treated with oral selinexor twice per week (on days 1 and 3) at one of three doses (30 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2, or flat dose of 60 mg) either continuously or on a schedule of 3 weeks on, 1 week off. PK analysis was performed under fasting and fed states (low v high fat content) and using various formulations of selinexor (tablet, capsule, or suspension). Tumor biopsies before and during treatment were evaluated for pharmacodynamic changes. Results: The most commonly reported drug-related adverse events (grade 1 or 2) were nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue, which were well managed with supportive care. Commonly reported grade 3 or 4 toxicities were fatigue, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphopenia, and leukopenia. Selinexor was significantly better tolerated when administered as a flat dose on an intermittent schedule. PK analysis of selinexor revealed a clinically insignificant increase (approximately 15% to 20%) in drug exposure when taken with food. Immunohistochemical analysis of paired tumor biopsies revealed increased nuclear accumulation of tumor suppressor proteins, decreased cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, and stromal deposition. Of the 52 patients evaluable for response, none experienced an objective response by RECIST (version 1.1); however, 17 (33%) showed durable (≥ 4 months) stable disease, including seven (47%) of 15 evaluable patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Conclusion: Selinexor was well tolerated at a 60-mg flat dose on a 3-weeks-on, 1-week-off schedule. There was no clinically meaningful impact of food on PKs. Preliminary evidence of anticancer activity in sarcoma was demonstrated.",,"Gounder, Mrinal M.; Zer, Alona; Tap, William D.; Salah, Samer; Dickson, Mark A.; Gupta, Abha A.; Keohan, Mary Louise; Loong, Herbert H.; D'Angelo, Sandra P.; Baker, Stephanie; Condy, Mercedes; Nyquist-Schultz, Kjirsten; Tanner, Lanier; Erinjeri, Joseph P.; Jasmine, Francis H.; Friedlander, Sharon; Carlson, Robert; Unger, Thaddeus J.; Saint-Martin, Jean Richard; Rashal, Tami; Ellis, Joel; Kauffman, Michael; Shacham, Sharon; Schwartz, Gary K.; Abdul Razak, Albiruni Ryan",2016,10.1200/JCO.2016.67.6346,0,158
168,Maternal separation induces neuroinflammation and long-lasting emotional alterations in mice,"Early life experiences play a key role in brain function and behaviour. Adverse events during childhood are therefore a risk factor for psychiatric disease during adulthood, such as mood disorders. Maternal separation is a validated mouse model for maternal neglect, producing negative early life experiences that result in subsequent emotional alteration. Mood disorders have been found to be associated with neurochemical changes and neurotransmitter deficits such as reduced availability of monoamines in discrete brain areas. Emotional alterations like depression result in reduced serotonin availability and enhanced kynurenine metabolism through the action of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase in response to neuroinflammatory factors. This mechanism involves regulation of the neurotransmitter system by neuroinflammatory agents, linking mood regulation to neuroinmunological reactions. In this context, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of maternal separation with early weaning on emotional behaviour in mice. We investigated neuroinflammatory responses and the state of the tryptophan-kynurenine metabolic pathway in discrete brain areas following maternal separation. We show that adverse events during early life increase risk of long-lasting emotional alterations during adolescence and adulthood. These emotional alterations are particularly severe in females. Behavioural impairments were associated with microglia activation and disturbed tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in brain areas related to emotional control. This finding supports the preeminent role of neuroinflammation in emotional disorders.",Despair behaviour; Early life experiences; Maternal neglect; Neuroinflammation; Tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism,"Gracia-Rubio, Irene; Moscoso-Castro, Maria; Pozo, Oscar J.; Marcos, Josep; Nadal, Roser; Valverde, Olga",2016,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2015.09.003,0,159
169,Black exclusion from school the way ahead,"Summary: Reflections on the response to black children in the British education system suggest that government legislation has in effect been an attempt to contain a perceived threat rather than a genuine effort to tackle inherent prejudice. While there are a variety of pressures on schools contributing to the rise in exclusion, this article argues that in particular the conflictual relationship between teachers and black students needs to be addressed. The authors provide a wide range of examples of good practice that reduce the risk of exclusion. Parental involvement is a central theme. They also point to the need for greater awareness and earlier intervention on the part of educational psychologists (EPs) in relation to issues of race and exclusion. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Grant, Denny; Brooks, Karl",1998,10.1080/0266736980140104,0,160
170,Characteristics of Effective Mental Health Consultation in Early Childhood Settings: Multilevel Analysis of a National Survey,"In response to (a) an increasing need to support children with emotional and behavioral challenges in childcare settings and (b) the high rates of expulsion among preschool children, mental health consultation in early childhood settings is becoming an increasingly popular intervention strategy. At the same time, there is little agreement or empirical evidence to help early childhood program managers and other professionals make decisions about the most important characteristics and services that mental health consultants should provide. The current study presents findings from a nationally representative survey of 74 Head Start programs and 655 Head Start directors, staff members, and mental health consultants to use in addressing this gap. Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM), the authors present results suggesting that the single most important characteristic of mental health consultants is their ability to build positive collaborative relationships with program staff members. The frequency of consultant activities was important, primarily because consultants who provided more frequent services were reported to have more positive relationships with staff members. These results were significant even after controlling for program-level characteristics, such as program size, budget for mental health services, and ratio of consultant hours to number of children. © 2006, Sage Publications.

171,School Referral Patterns Among Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance Enrolled in Systems of Care,"School staff play a critical role in referring adolescents with serious emotional disturbance (SED) to mental health services; however, the mechanisms underlying this referral process are poorly understood. We used data from adolescents (N = 4365) enrolled in SAMHSA’s Children’s Mental Health Initiative Systems of Care (SOC) and participating in a national evaluation to compare the profiles of youth referred for SOC services by school staff with youth referred for those services by professionals at other agencies. We sought to identify whether school staff referred a unique set of adolescents by examining indicators of global impairment and impairment in school functioning (i.e., absences, suspensions, failures). Using multilevel regression models, we estimated the association of global impairment and school functioning with referral source (i.e., school vs. other) and controlled for SOC community characteristics and individual-level socio-demographics. Findings indicated that adolescents referred from schools had significantly lower levels of global impairment than adolescents referred from mental health settings. However, they had considerable school-related impairment, with rates of absences, suspensions, and failures that were equivalent to youth referred from most other agencies. This study is the first to examine school-related impairment among youth receiving SOC services as a function of referral source. By identifying adolescents with more mild global impairment, who nonetheless experienced significant impairment in school functioning, schools can be key contributors to effectively identifying a unique set of adolescents for SOC services. Further, schools might meaningfully inform the provision of comprehensive services to this population by educating community agencies about school functioning among youth with SED.",Adolescents; Referral; School mental health; Services; Systems of care,"Green, Jennifer Greif; Xuan, Ziming; Kwong, Lana; Hoagwood, Kimberly; Leaf, Philip J.",2016,10.1007/s10826-015-0209-4,0,162
172,Social and emotional learning and equity in school discipline,"Beginning as early as preschool, race and gender are intertwined with the way US schools mete out discipline. In particular, black students and male students are much more likely than others to be suspended or expelled-punishments that we know can hold them back academically. These disparities, and the damage they can cause, have driven recent reforms, including some that incorporate social and emotional learning (SEL) practices. Anne Gregory and Edward Fergus review federal and state mandates to cut down on punishments that remove students from school, and they show how some districts are embracing SEL in their efforts to do so. Yet even in these districts, large disparities in discipline persist. The authors suggest two reasons current discipline reforms that embrace SEL practices may hold limited promise for reducing discipline disparities. The first is that prevailing “colorblind” notions of SEL don’t consider power, privilege, and cultural difference-thus ignoring how individual beliefs and structural biases can lead educators to react harshly to behaviors that fall outside a white cultural frame of reference. The second is that most SEL models are centered on students, but not on the adults who interact with them. Yet research shows that educators’ own social and emotional competencies strongly influence students’ motivation to learn and the school climate in general. Gregory and Fergus describe how one school district is striving to orient its discipline policies around a conception of SEL that stresses equity and promotes both adults’ and students’ SEL competencies. Although such reforms hold promise, they are still in the early stages, and the authors call for rigorous empirical work to test whether such efforts can substantially reduce or eradicate racial and gender disparities in discipline.",,"Gregory, Anne; Fergus, Edward",2017,10.1353/foc.2017.0006,1,163
173,The discipline gap and African Americans: Defiance or cooperation in the high school classroom,"African Americans are over-represented in school suspensions, yet little is known about the underlying contributing dynamics. Study 1 reviewed a high school's annual discipline data and 442 students referred for defiance. African Americans were over-represented in referrals for defiance and most students received referrals from one or several teachers. This suggests that defiance referrals are specific to the classroom situation. Examining the situational specificity of referrals, Study 2 used repeated measures and multilevel modeling with a sub-sample of 30 African American students. Attendance, grades, and teacher reports showed that students behaved more defiantly and less cooperatively with teachers perceived as having untrustworthy authority. Predictors of African American student trust in teacher authority included teacher caring and high expectations, offering implications for lowering the discipline gap. © 2007 Society for the Study of School Psychology.",Adolescents; African Americans; Discipline; High School; Teacher,"Gregory, Anne; Weinstein, Rhona S.",2008,10.1016/j.jsp.2007.09.001,0,164

175,Surgical and medical second trimester abortion in South Africa: A cross-sectional study,"Background: A high percentage of abortions performed in South Africa are in the second trimester. However, little research focuses on women's experiences seeking second trimester abortion or the efficacy and safety of these services. The objectives are to document clinical and acceptability outcomes of second trimester medical and surgical abortion as performed at public hospitals in the Western Cape Province. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional study of women undergoing abortion at 12.1-20.9 weeks at five hospitals in Western Cape Province, South Africa in 2008. Two hundred and twenty women underwent D&E with misoprostol cervical priming, and 84 underwent induction with misoprostol alone. Information was obtained about the procedure and immediate complications, and women were interviewed after recovery. Results: Median gestational age at abortion was earlier for D&E clients compared to induction (16.0 weeks vs. 18.1 weeks, p < 0.001). D&E clients reported shorter intervals between first clinic visit and abortion (median 17 vs. 30 days, p < 0.001). D&E was more effective than induction (99.5% vs. 50.0% of cases completed on-site without unplanned surgical procedure, p < 0.001). Although immediate complications were similar (43.8% D&E vs. 52.4% induction), all three major complications occurred with induction. Early fetal expulsion occurred in 43.3% of D&E cases. While D&E clients reported higher pain levels and emotional discomfort, most women were satisfied with their experience. Conclusions: As currently performed in South Africa, second trimester abortions by D&E were more effective than induction procedures, required shorter hospital stay, had fewer major immediate complications and were associated with shorter delays accessing care. Both services can be improved by implementing evidence-based protocols. © 2011 Grossman et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Grossman, Daniel; Constant, Deborah; Lince, Naomi; Alblas, Marijke; Blanchard, Kelly; Harries, Jane",2011,,0,166
176,"Evaluation into the Relationship: Reflections on New Trends in Evaluation, Assessment, and Classification","From a clinical and psychoanalytically informed point of view, the process of evaluation is mainly concerned with the formation of a working alliance with the infant. Assessment is, therefore, considered as a process that cannot be applied in a systematic way, regardless of the situation. On the contrary, it is based upon transference and countertransference, which guides the clinician, along with the infant's behavior and reactions, during the consultation. From this perspective, evaluation should always have some therapeutic impact. Paradoxically, this therapeutic action is linked with the suspension of diagnostic process for a period of time. The prognosis and treatment planning is mostly based upon the evaluation of change during the expended assessment period. The more serious the situation, the longer the assessment to determine why the infant is at risk, what are the positive aspects of the situation, and what are the ways to reach the infant through the relationship with the parents.",,"Guedeney, Antoine; Lebovici, Serge",1997,10.1002/(sici)1097-0355(199722)18:2<171::aid-imhj6>3.0.co;2-s,0,167
177,Using Food Redistribution To Reduce Packing in Children With Severe Food Refusal,"Positive- and negative-reinforcement-based procedures typically have targeted acceptance for children with severe food refusal; however, these procedures do not always result in successful swallowing. Once acceptance is achieved, some children expel the food repeatedly or pack (hold or pocket) it in their mouths for extended periods of time. This study evaluated the effects of using food redistribution with a bristled massaging toothbrush to reduce packing and increase consumption in 4 children with severe feeding disorders. Packing was reduced for all children. In addition, latency to clean mouth (the duration of time from acceptance to food no longer being present in the child's mouth in the absence of expulsion) for 2 children decreased when the food-redistribution procedure was used. Results are discussed in terms of the potential operant functions of the food-redistribution procedure.",,"Gulotta, Charles S.; Piazza, Cathleen C.; Patel, Meeta R.; Layer, Stacy A.",2005,10.1901/jaba.2005.168-03,0,168

A prospective, randomised, evaluator-blinded study was carried at a single tertiary care centre over eight years, looking at 100 patients with chronic suppurative otitis media involving small tympanic membrane perforations and pulsatile mucopurulent discharge. The patients were randomised and divided into two groups. In group A, the examination under microscope, with suction cleaning of the external canal, was followed by irrigation of the middle ear with antibiotic+steroid solution for up to one week, while group B was prescribed self-administration of the same drops with systemic antibiotics. The patients were followed up daily for 10 days to monitor otorrhoea relief and on a weekly basis subsequently to monitor the healing of the tympanic membrane. Forty-nine patients in group A had a dry ear after 3-7 days of daily suction and the irrigation of middle ear with the antibiotic+steroid solution and 44 had a healed tympanic membrane after an average three months of follow-up. Five patients with dry ear but persistent perforation underwent tympanoplasty, while only one patient with a persistent ear discharge underwent mastoid exploration. In group B, eight patients on oral antibiotics and self-administration of the same drops had dry ear while 34 had dry ear after receiving intravenous antibiotics. Thirty perforations healed spontaneously and 12 required tympanoplasty. In 8 patients, the tympano-mastoid was explored and these patients had dry, hearing ears only after surgery. Patients with chronic suppurative otitis media involving small perforations and pulsatile discharge can be managed conservatively with simple suction cleaning + middle ear irrigation with antibiotics + steroid drops.",,"Gupta, M.; Singh, S.; Singh, H.; Chauhan, B.",2014,,0,169

180,"High proportion of nontypeable streptococcus pneumoniae isolates among sporadic, nonoutbreak cases of bacterial conjunctivitis","Purpose: Outbreaks of bacterial conjunctivitis have been linked to nontypeable strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae that lack a capsule, a key virulence factor for invasive infections. In contrast, isolates from sporadic, nonoutbreak cases of conjunctivitis were thought to be similar to invasive or nasopharyngeal isolates with respect to their capsular serotype and antibiotic resistance profile. This hypothesis was tested for 302 strains isolated during three prospective, multicenter clinical studies of bacterial conjunctivitis. Materials and methods: S. pneumoniae capsular serotypes were determined by agglutination assay and confirmed by the Statens Serum Institute. The presence of the cpsAB capsule genes was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Minimum inhibitory concentrations were measured for 17 antibacterial drugs by the broth microdilution method. Results: Only 25 (8.3%) isolates reacted with the capsule-specific antisera and only one (0.3%) of these serotypes was covered by the capsule-specific PCV7 vaccine. The remaining 277 (91.7%) isolates were nontypeable, suggesting that they did not produce a capsule. PCR analysis indicated the loss of the capsule operon in 24/25 randomly selected nontypeable strains. Resistance rates were highest for azithromycin, trimethoprim, and tetracycline, while no resistance was detected for the fluoroquinolones, linezolid, and vancomycin. Antibiotic resistance rates were generally lower than those reported for invasive isolates, although some highly resistant or multidrug-resistant isolates were identified. Conclusions: The prevalence of nontypeable strains of S. pneumoniae was higher than expected, while the number of isolates responsive to the PCV7 vaccine was surprisingly low. These results highlight the need for new vaccines that can target all S. pneumoniae strains regardless of the presence or nature of a capsule. In addition, resistance to azithromycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim was greater than 10%, which may be relevant when selecting empiric treatments for ocular surface infections. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Antibiotic resistance; Bacterial conjunctivitis; Capsule; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Vaccine strains,"Haas, Wolfgang; Hesje, Christine K.; Sanfilippo, Christine M.; Morris, Timothy W.",2011,10.3109/02713683.2011.624670,0,171
181,"An ecological-systems inquiry into racial disproportionalities in out-of-school suspensions from youth, caregiver and educator perspectives","This research examines the perspectives of youths, their caregivers and educators on specific incidences of recent out-of-school suspensions. Racial disproportionality in out-of-school suspensions is a persistent, multi-level social justice and child well-being issue. We examined suspensions sensitized primarily by an ecological-systems perspective and secondarily by critical race and social language theories. We employed a mixed methods design with an emphasis on the qualitative component. Twenty-eight youths with recent out-of-school suspensions, 25 of their caregivers and 16 educators participated in individual, semi-structured, audiotaped interviews. Participants from all groups expressed a commitment to youths' education, viewed suspensions as a racial issue, believed youth and caregiver behaviors contributed to suspensions, observed that suspensions are harmful to youth achievement and educator-youth relationships, and emphasized the need for youths to have caring relationships with educators and to change problematic behaviors. Youths underscored the role of peer behaviors in their suspensions and the impact of suspensions on their peer relationships. Caregivers emphasized the negative impact of suspensions on family-school relationships, and the need for interventions that provide moral, spiritual and general guidance to youth. Family members (caregivers and youths) underscored the need for intervention to improve educators' sensitivity to youths. Educators emphasized the need to maintain a positive learning environment for all students, and for preventive and flexible approaches to problematic youth behaviors. They also described a variety of macro system constraints to implementing better alternatives to suspensions. These included inadequate school resources, legal liability issues and a culturally diverse student population and relatively homogeneous staff.

182,Prognostic significance of neurological signs in high-risk infants - a systematic review,"The aim of this paper was to systematically review the literature on the significance of specific neurological signs in infancy, in particular in infants at risk for developmental problems such as cerebral palsy (CP). A literature search was performed using the databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and AMED. Papers on infantile reactions ('primitive reflexes') and postural reactions were included if data were available allowing for calculation of sensitivity, specificity, or positive and negative predictive value for CP or atypical developmental outcome. Our search identified 23 articles on 20 different neurological signs. Properties of six neurological signs were reported in at least three different papers. The data indicated that, in early infancy, an absent Moro or plantar grasp response may be predictive for adverse developmental outcome. After early infancy, persistence of the Moro response and asymmetric tonic neck reflex was clinically significant. Prediction of a delayed emergence of the parachute reaction increases with age. Abnormal performances on the pull-to-sit manoeuvre and vertical suspension test have predictive significance throughout infancy. The neurological signs reviewed have some predictive value in infants at risk. For most of the signs, criteria for abnormality and significance are age-dependent. What this paper adds: In early infancy, an absent Moro or plantar grasp response may be predictive for adverse developmental outcome including cerebral palsy. After early infancy, persistence of the Moro response and asymmetric tonic neck reflex indicates a higher risk for poor developmental outcome. Abnormal performances on the pull-to-sit manoeuvre and vertical suspension test have predictive significance throughout infancy.",,"Hamer, Elisa G.; Hadders-Algra, Mijna",2016,10.1111/dmcn.13051,0,173

This study examines the efficacy of combined surgical techniques for OSA including tongue base suspension (TBS), using perioperative polysomnograms (PSG) in pediatric patients with CP. Study design: Case series with outcome analysis. Setting: University based tertiary care children's hospital. Methods: A 7-year retrospective chart review of children with CP who underwent surgical management for OSA. Surgical procedures, postoperative complications, and perioperative PSG data were examined. Only patients with both preoperative and postoperative PSG results were included in the study. Based upon procedures performed patients fell into 2 equal groups for analysis. Results: Fourteen children were identified. Seven patients (mean age = 6.0 years) underwent combined adenotonsillectomy (T&A), uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), and tongue base suspension (TBS). Another 7 patients (mean age = 6.3 years) underwent T&A and UPPP alone. Those who received TBS had a mean preoperative AHI of 27.2 compared to 6.8 in the group that did not have TBS. The AHI decreased by a mean of 16.5 in the TBS group and 5.0 in the non-TBS group. The mean oxygen saturation nadir improved in both the TBS (74.0-84.0) and non-TBS (64.8-84.6) groups. The arousal index also improved in the TBS (33.1-20.7) and non-TBS (11.0-5.8) groups. No surgical complications occurred. Conclusion: This study suggests that concomitant surgical approaches for OSA in children with CP are effective.

From October 1985 until March 1991, 29 infants and children were treated for this syndrome by innominate artery reimplantation. In all patients severe anterior vascular compression of the trachea was demonstrated preoperatively by bronchoscopy and in 17 the diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging scanning. Indications for operation included apneic episodes in 17 (58.6%), severe stridor in seven (24.1%), recurrent bronchopulmonary infections in four (13.8%), and exercise-induced stridor in one (3.4%). Through a median sternotomy, the innominate artery was reimplanted more proximally on the ascending aorta and to the right of the trachea. In this new position, the innominate artery no longer crosses the trachea anteriorly, and the anatomic cause of tracheal obstruction is completely eliminated. There were no early or late deaths, and 27 of the 29 patients (93%) had complete resolution of symptoms. Partial resolution of symptoms was seen in two patients (7%). Reimplantation of the innominate artery offers a unique method by which the anatomic cause of tracheal compression is eliminated. It is a safe and effective means of treating symptomatic compression of the trachea by the innominate artery.",,"Hawkins, J. A.; Bailey, W. W.; Clark, S. M.",1992,10.1016/s0022-5223(19)34951-7,0,175

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 11,318), I examine the influence of longitudinal measures across childhood of family structure duration and the number and timing of parent transitions (entrances and exits) on indicators of grade point average (GPA), college expectations, and suspension or expulsion in adolescence.

187,"The impact of school suspension on student tobacco use: A longitudinal study in Victoria, Australia, and Washington State, United States","Context: School suspension may have unintended consequences in contributing to problem behaviors, including dropping out from school, substance use, and antisocial behavior. Tobacco use is an early-onset problem behavior, but prospective studies of the effects of suspension on tobacco use are lacking. Method: Longitudinal school-based survey of students drawn as a two-stage cluster sample, administered in 2002 and 2003, in Washington State, United States, and Victoria, Australia. The study uses statewide representative samples of students in Grades 7 and 9 (N = 3,599). Results: Rates of tobacco use were higher for Victorian than Washington State students. School suspension remained a predictor of current tobacco use at 12-month follow-up, after controlling for established risk factors including prior tobacco and other drug use for Grade 7 but not Grade 9 students. Conclusions: School suspension is associated with early adolescent tobacco use, itself an established predictor of adverse outcomes in young people. Findings suggest the need to explore process mechanisms and alternatives to school suspensions as a response to challenging student behavior in early adolescence. © 2012 Society for Public Health Education.",adolescence; cross-national study; longitudinal study; risk factors; suspension; tobacco,"Hemphill, Sheryl A.; Heerde, Jessica A.; Herrenkohl, Todd I.; Toumbourou, John W.; Catalano, Richard F.",2012,10.1177/1090198111406724,0,177

Methods: The sample comprised 927 students from Victoria, Australia who completed a modified version of the self-report Communities That Care Youth Survey in Grades 9–11 to report on risk factors, traditional and cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization, problem behavior, and mental health. Complete data on over 650 participants were analyzed. Results: Five per cent of Grade 9 and 10 students reported cyber-bullying perpetration only, 6–8 % reported victimization only, and 8–9 % both cyber-bullied others and were cyber-bullied. Results showed that cyber-bullying others in Grade 10 was associated with theft in Grade 11, cyber-victimization in Grade 10 was linked with Grade 11 depressive symptoms, and Grade 10 cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization combined predicted Grade 11 school suspension and binge drinking. Conclusions: Prevention approaches that target traditional and cyber-bullying, and established risk factors are necessary.

189,"Does school suspension affect subsequent youth non-violent antisocial behaviour? A longitudinal study of students in Victoria, Australia and Washington State, United States","School suspension has been not only associated with negative behaviours but also is predictive of future poor outcomes. The current study investigates (1) whether school suspension is a unique predictor of youth non-violent antisocial behaviour (NVAB) relative to other established predictors, and (2) whether the predictors of NVAB are similar in Australia and the United States (USA). The data analysed here draw on two statewide representative samples of Grade 7 and 9 students in Victoria, Australia and Washington State, USA, resurveyed at 12-month follow-up (N=3,677, 99% retention). School suspension did not uniquely predict NVAB in the final model. The predictors of NVAB, similar across states, included previous student NVAB, current alcohol and tobacco use, poor family management, association with antisocial friends, and low commitment to school. An implication of the findings is that US evidence-based prevention programmes targeting the influences investigated here could be trialled in Australia. © 2013 The Australian Psychological Society.",Adolescents; Antisocial behaviour; Cross-cultural study; Predictors; School suspension,"Hemphill, Sheryl A.; Kotevski, Aneta; Herrenkohl, Todd I.; Smith, Rachel; Toumbourou, John W.; Catalano, Richard F.",2013,10.1111/ajpy.12026,0,179
190,"Student and school factors associated with school suspension: A multilevel analysis of students in Victoria, Australia and Washington State, United States","One of the common issues schools face is how best to handle challenging student behaviors such as violent behavior, antisocial behavior, bullying, school rule violations, and interrupting other students' learning. School suspension may be used to remove students engaging in challenging behaviors from the school for a period of time. However, the act of suspending students from school may worsen rather than improve their behavior. Research shows that suspensions predict a range of student outcomes, including crime, delinquency, and drug use. It is therefore crucial to understand the factors associated with the use of school suspension, particularly in sites with different policy approaches to problem behaviors. This paper draws on data from state-representative samples of 3129 Grade 7 and 9 students in Washington State, United States and Victoria, Australia sampled in 2002. Multilevel modeling examined student and school level factors associated with student-reported school suspension. Results showed that both student (being male, previous student antisocial and violent behavior, rebelliousness, academic failure) and school (socioeconomic status of the school, aggregate measures of low school commitment) level factors were associated with school suspension and that the factors related to suspension were similar in the two states. The implications of the findings for effective school behavior management policy are that, rather than focusing only on the student, both student and school level factors need to be addressed to reduce the rates of school suspension. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Bi-national study; Correlates; School exclusion; School level risk factors; School suspension,"Hemphill, Sheryl A.; Plenty, Stephanie M.; Herrenkohl, Todd I.; Toumbourou, John W.; Catalano, Richard F.",2014,10.1016/j.childyouth.2013.11.022,0,180
191,Modifiable determinants of youth violence in Australia and the United States: A longitudinal study,"Youth violence is a global problem. Few studies have examined whether the prevalence or predictors of youth violence are similar in comparable Western countries like Australia and the United States (US). In the current article, analyses are conducted using two waves of data collected as part of a longitudinal study of adolescent development in approximately 4,000 students aged 12 to 16 years in Victoria, Australia and Washington State, US. Students completed a self-report survey of problem behaviours including violent behaviour, as well as risk and protective factors across five domains (individual, family, peer, school, community). Compared to Washington State, rates of attacking or beating another over the past 12 months were lower in Victoria for females in the first survey and higher for Victorian males in the follow-up survey. Preliminary analyses did not show state-specific predictors of violent behaviour. In the final multivariate analyses of the combined Washington State and Victorian samples, protective factors were being female and student emotion control. Risk factors were prior violent behaviour, family conflict, association with violent peers, community disorganisation, community norms favourable to drug use, school suspensions and arrests. Given the similarity of influential factors in North America and Australia, application of US early intervention and prevention programs may be warranted, with some tailoring to the Australian context.",Adolescents; Cross-national study; Longitudinal study; Risk and protective factors; Youth violence,"Hemphill, Sheryl A.; Smith, Rachel; Toumbourou, John W.; Herrenkohl, Todd I.; Catalano, Richard F.; McMorris, Barbara J.; Romaniuk, Helena",2009,10.1375/acri.42.3.289,0,181
192,The Effect of School Suspensions and Arrests on Subsequent Adolescent Antisocial Behavior in Australia and the United States,"Purpose: To examine the effect of school suspensions and arrests (i.e., being taken into police custody) on subsequent adolescent antisocial behavior such as violence and crime, after controlling for established risk and protective factors in Victoria, Australia and Washington State, United States (U.S.). Methods: This article reports on analyses of two points of data collected 1 year apart within a cross-national longitudinal study of the development of antisocial behavior, substance use, and related behaviors in approximately 4000 students aged 12 to 16 years in Victoria, Australia and Washington State, U.S. Students completed a modified version of the Communities That Care self-report survey of behavior, as well as risk and protective factors across five domains (individual, family, peer, school, and community). Multivariate logistic regression analyses investigate the effect of school suspensions and arrests on subsequent antisocial behavior, holding constant individual, family, peer, school, and community level influences such as being female, student belief in the moral order, emotional control, and attachment to mother. Results: At the first assessment, school suspensions and arrests were more commonly reported in Washington, and school suspensions significantly increased the likelihood of antisocial behavior 12 months later, after holding constant established risk and protective factors (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.1, p < .05). Predictors of antisocial behavior spanned risk and protective factors across five individual and ecological areas of risk. Risk factors in this study were pre-existing antisocial behavior (OR 3.6, CI 2.7-4.7, p < .001), association with antisocial peers (OR 1.8, CI 1.4-2.4, p < .001), academic failure (OR 1.3, CI 1.1-1.5, p < .01), and perceived availability of drugs in the community (OR 1.3, CI 1.1-1.5, p < .001). Protective factors included being female (OR 0.7, CI 0.5-0.9, p < .01), student belief in the moral order (OR 0.8, CI 0.6-1.0, p < .05), student emotional control (OR 0.7, CI 0.6-0.8, p < .001), and attachment to mother (OR 0.8, CI 0.7-1.0, p < .05). Conclusions: School suspensions may increase the likelihood of future vior.

193,"Predictors and responses to the growth in physical violence during adolescence: A comparison of students in Washington State and Victoria, Australia","This study investigates patterns in violence over 3 time points in early to midadolescence in 2 statewide representative samples of youth, one in Washington State, USA, and the other in Victoria, Australia. Comparable data collection methods in both states were used to cross-nationally compare patterns of violence, risk factors, and responses to violence (school suspensions and arrests) in 2 policy contexts. Risk factors include early use of alcohol, binge drinking, involvement with antisocial peers, family conflict, poor family management, sensation seeking, and bully victimization. These are modeled as correlates of initial violence and predictors of change in violence over a 3-year period, from ages 12-15, for participating youth. Results suggest that patterns and predictors of violence are mostly similar in the 2 states. Initial levels of violence (age 13) and change over time in violence were associated in both states with more youth school suspensions and more police arrests in Grade 9. Some cross-national differences were also shown. For example, correlations of violence with gender and violence with binge drinking were stronger in Victoria, whereas correlations of violence with early use of alcohol and with antisocial peer involvement were stronger in Washington State. Antisocial peer involvement and family conflict were significant predictors of a gradual increase in violence from Grades 7-9 for youth in Victoria only.

The objective of this study was to determine whether there is an association between the use of EA and different aspects of labor. The author(s) analyzed the effect of EA on different aspects of labor in a retrospective cohort observational study of deliveries in a public Spanish hospital during a 3-year period. Women with EA administration were found to increase the risk of stimulated labor, reduce the percentage of spontaneous deliveries, increase the risk of instrumental labor due to stalled labor or loss of fetal well-being, and increase the percentage of episiotomies. However, women with EA were not and increased risk for perineal laceration or the condition of the membranes at the delivery or with the type of placental expulsion. Thus, the administration of EA should be assessed in each case by the health care professional.",epidural analgesia; instrumental delivery; labor onset; labor progression; midwifery,"Herrera-Gómez, Antonio; De Luna-Bertos, Elvira; Ramos-Torrecillas, Javier; Ocaña-Peinado, Francisco M.; Ruiz, Concepción; García-Martínez, Olga",2018,10.1177/1054773817722689,0,184

Statistical analyses showed that none of the premilitary variables predicted war zone violence. However, high combat exposure did predict war zone abusive violence and PTSD. In addition, participation in war zone violence predicted postmilitary violence to self, spouse, and others. Although high rates of childhood victimization and high levels of combat exposure were found, neither predicted postmilitary violence, criminal activities, drug/alcohol problems, or suicide attempts.

In addition to prevalence, enrollment and provider characteristics that predicted expulsion were examined. Although there is increasing awareness of the prevalence of early childhood suspension and expulsion in early care and education settings and the negative effects it has on children's development, few studies have included or focused on HBCC, where many children receive care. This study highlights that many home-based providers, especially listed providers, report that they expelled at least one child within the last year. Significant predictors of expulsion emerged, including enrollment characteristics such as caring for children with disabilities, enrolling more children, and caring for children unrelated to the provider. Provider characteristics, including years of experience, provider education, and provider age, also predicted provider report of expulsion. These results provide insight as to possible strategies that may be effective in reducing expulsion rates in this caregiving context.",challenging behavior; early childhood education; expulsion; family child care; home-based child care; 家庭儿童看护; 家庭托儿所; 幼儿教育; 开除; 挑战性行为,"Hooper, Alison; Schweiker, Claire",2020,10.1002/imhj.21845,1,188

Hoover, 2006) was used to advance a statewide agenda for early childhood mental health consultation in Colorado. The study involved a survey of licensed childcare providers throughout the state asking about the behavior of children in their care and their responses to that behavior. Exclusion of children from early care and education settings due to challenging behavior was found to be a significant problem taking a toll on families, children, and early care and education providers. Importantly, results from the survey indicated that the rate of exclusion of children from care due to challenging behavior was lower for family childcare providers who had access to mental health consultation.

Employing a multiple baseline design, 13 males (9.0–10.2 years of age) with a history of school suspensions were sequentially introduced to KooLKIDS, a school-based interactive multimedia intervention for young children with EOCP and CU. Teacher and child self-report data revealed significant reductions for the group in proactive and reactive aggression, and antisocial traits. Significant changes in the desired direction were also found on measures of emotion regulation.

201,Delayed hepatic rupture post ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy,"Rationale: Hemorrhage, one of complications after liver biopsy, is often identified immediately after the procedure while delayed liver rupture is relatively rare. Patient concerns: A 45-year-old woman was diagnosed with undetermined liver cirrhosis and abnormal liver function. To determine the etiology and severity of liver cirrhosis, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was arranged. The patients did not complain any pain during the procedure. Ultrasound examination on postoperative day1 (POD 1) and MRI on POD 3 showed no evidence of hematoma and ascites. On POD 7, however, the patient was taken to the hospital with a sudden onset of pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Diagnoses: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed liver rupture of right inferior segment of the liver with subcapsular hematoma. Interventions: Patient was treated with infusion of 2-unit red blood cell suspension, fluid and hemostatics. Outcomes: The vital signs of the patient were stabilized after the therapy. The follow-up ultrasound 1 month later showed a shrunken subcapsular hematoma measuring 4.2 × 2.1 cm at the right lobe. Lessons: Whenever a liver biopsy procedure is performed, the care should be taken to avoid puncturing those areas that may have liver incisure. Moreover, the patient need to rest for several days and to avoid heavy activities, which is one of the major risk factors for post-procedure bleeding.",complications; hemorrhage; liver biopsy; liver rupture; ultrasound,"Huang, Jia Yan; Lu, Qiang; Liu, Ji Bin",2018,10.1097/MD.0000000000009955,0,191

Farn & J. Adams, 2016). As such, helping all children to be successful in school is a top priority for parents, educators, and politicians alike. However, schools are challenged by an increasing demand to meet children's health and metal health needs in order for them to benefit from, and progress in, their educational experience.

203,An evaluation of a short cognitive-behavioural anger management intervention for pupils at risk of exclusion,"An increasing number of children and young people are being excluded from school as a direct result of anger management problems. The research literature suggests that short cognitive-behavioural intervention programmes may be effective in helping young people understand and control their anger. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a short cognitive-behavioural anger management intervention in reducing problem behaviours in school, and to identify factors that may facilitate or impede participant progress on such a programme. The sample comprised 12 young people (mean age 14y 2m) referred for anger problems in an inner-city school in the north-west of England. A phase change (baseline, intervention, follow-up) design was implemented to measure changes in problem behaviours using the Revised Rutter Scale for Teachers. This was augmented by qualitative data gathered in interviews and non-participant observations. Significant improvements in behaviour were observed as a result of the intervention, although for some domains this was not maintained at four-week follow-up. Analysis of qualitative data revealed a number of issues that might impact on the success of an intervention, including notions of power in the classroom, treatment readiness, and the importance of sharing thoughts, feelings and experiences with others. Despite limitations inherent in the research design, the intervention was deemed a success. However, our findings show the need for researchers and practitioners alike to 'look beyond the child' when hypothesising about the causes of anger problems in educational contexts. © 2006 SEBDA.",Adolescence; Anger management; Cognitive-behavioural therapy,"Humphrey, Neil; Brooks, A.

Lower levels of client denial at intake predicted successful program compliance. Higher levels of denial were found in nonadjudicated youths. Although program attrition was high (50% in the first year), relatively few youths were expelled for sexual (4.9%) or nonsexual delinquency (6.6%) over a 12- to 24-month period. Program failure during years 1 and 2 was attributable largely to expulsion for failure to comply with attendance requirements and/or therapeutic directives. Youths failing to comply were found to have higher overall levels of measured sexual maladjustment and may be at greater long-term risk for sexual recidivism.

205,Liposomal Bupivacaine Versus Standard Periarticular Injection in Total Knee Arthroplasty With Regional Anesthesia: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel) is a long-acting local anesthetic preparation with demonstrated efficacy over placebo in reducing postoperative pain and opioid requirement. Limited comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness data exist for its use in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) when used in a multimodal, opioid-sparing analgesic and anesthetic approach. We hypothesized that liposomal bupivacaine offers no clinical advantage over our standard of care but carries significant economic impact. Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial comparing liposomal bupivacaine periarticular injection (PAI) to our current approach including conventional bupivacaine PAI, in the setting of regional anesthesia. All adult unilateral TKA patients of the collaborating surgeon were eligible to participate in the study. Patients were randomized 1:1 to either the liposomal bupivacaine protocol or the standard-of-care protocol. All patients received regional anesthesia and standard postoperative analgesia protocols. Patients and all postoperative healthcare providers were blinded to study arm assignment. Results: A total of 59 patients were enrolled per our a priori power calculation after 1 exclusion for randomization error. No significant demographic differences between the study arms were found. There was no statistically significant difference in the primary outcome of number of physical therapy (PT) sessions required to achieve home-going discharge goals (3.0 ± 1.2 vs 3.6 ± 1.3, P =.137), nor in the clinical secondary outcomes. A significant difference in medication charges was found.

207,Parental History of Disruptive Life Events and Household Food Insecurity,"Objective To investigate whether a history of disruptive life events (ie, school suspension or expulsion, job termination, hospitalization for mental health, and/or criminal justice involvement) among parents is positively associated with household food insecurity. Design Structured interviews and self-report surveys. Setting Households across all 50 states in the US. Participants Subsample of 6,270 households that participated in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Birth Cohort with valid maternal and paternal data. Main Outcome Measures Food insecurity was measured when children were aged 9 months (wave 1), 2 years (wave 2), and 4 years (wave 3). Parental history of disruptive life events was measured at wave 1. Analysis Logistic regression was used to carry out the analyses. Results Each examined disruptive life event was associated with a significant increase in the odds of persistent household food insecurity (P <.05). The probability of persistent household food insecurity was >6 times as large in households with 1 or both parents reporting the occurrence of each of the disruptive life events, relative to households with none of these parental risk factors. Conclusions and Implications Practitioners may want to consider parental history of various disruptive life events in their assessment of familial risk of household food insecurity. Future policy efforts might include a cost–benefit estimate analysis of intervening earlier in the food insecurity–disruptive life events nexus to advocate for savings to the taxpayer for prevention services.

Design: Retrospective medical chart review of all patients with Down syndrome who had UAO during a 5-year period. Setting: Academic tertiary care children's hospital. Patients: Seventy-one pediatric patients with Down syndrome who bad significant UAO. Thirty-four patients bad pulmonary artery hypertension; 44 patients had multiple sites of airway obstruction. The obstructive problems included lymphoid hyperplasia, macroglossia, narrow nasopharynx, laryngomalacia, congenital subglottic stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia, and tracheal stenosis. Interventions: Children with Down syndrome and UAO underwent surgical procedures including tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, tonsillar pillar plication, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, anterior tongue reduction, tonguehyoid suspension, laryngotracheoplasty, and tracheotomy. Main Outcome Measures: Postoperative symptoms found on medical chart review, or parental telephone survey, or both, and results of postoperative diagnostic tests. Patients were grouped as 'improved' or having 'significant residual symptoms.' Results: Twenty-seven of the 55 surgical patients had mild obstructive symptoms, and most improved after tonsil or adenoid surgery, or both. The remaining patients were younger and had more severe symptoms, multiple sites of obstruction, and a high incidence of cardiac disease. Eleven (39%) of the 28 patients in this group had significant residual symptoms after surgery. Four children are tracheotomy-dependent. Five deaths occurred; 3 were attributable to the upper airway. Conclusions: Upper airway obstruction in children with Down syndrome often is a complex process with multilocal causes. Residual symptoms of airway obstruction are common after surgery. A comprehensive and individualized approach is important in the management of UAO in Down syndrome.",,"Jacobs, Jan N.; Gray, Robert F.; Todd, N. Wendell",1996,,0,197
209,Punishment and Inequality at an Early Age: Exclusionary Discipline in Elementary School,"We advance current knowledge of school punishment by examining (1) the prevalence of exclusionary discipline in elementary school, (2) racial disparities in exclusionary discipline in elementary school, and (3) the association between exclusionary discipline and aggressive behavior in elementary school. Using child and parent reports from the Fragile Families Study, we estimate that more than one in ten children born between 1998 and 2000 in large US cities were suspended or expelled by age nine, when most were in third grade. We also find extreme racial disparity; about 40 percent of non-Hispanic black boys were suspended or expelled, compared to 8 percent of non-Hispanic white or other-race boys. Disparities are largely due to differences in children's school and home environments rather than to behavior problems. Next, consistent with social stress and strain theories, we find suspension or expulsion associated with increased aggressive behavior in elementary school. This association does not vary by race but is robust to a rich set of covariates, within-individual fixed effects, and matching methods. In conjunction with what we find for racial disparities, our results imply that school discipline policies relying heavily on exclusionary punishment may be fostering childhood inequality.",,"Jacobsen, Wade C.; Pace, Garrett T.; Ramirez, Nayan G.",2019,10.1093/sf/soy072,0,198
210,Improved pain management with daily nursing intervention during radiation therapy for head and neck carcinoma,"This study evaluated the response to a defined mouth care and analgesic treatment protocol for oropharyngeal mucositis in patients undergoing radiation therapy for head and neck carcinoma. Nineteen patients completed a 15 question pain survey before each radiation treatment. Patients were given instructions on the use of mouthwashes and a three-step analgesic protocol: acetaminophen, acetaminophen with codeine suspension, and oral morphine (20 mg/mL) for mild, moderate, and severe pain, respectively. Patients were seen daily by a radiation therapy nurse who reviewed the survey and prompt changes in the prescribed analgesic regimen were then made by a physician. Marked differences in control of pain related to radiation mucositis were observed when compared to patients from our prior study who used the same daily survey but had only sporadic nursing intervention and no analgesic protocol. Patients having daily nursing intervention reported fewer days of moderate/severe pain, had less pain throughout the day, and noted less disturbance in sleep, eating, and energy level. Weight loss of greater than 5 kg was noted in only three patients. Analgesics were used on 77% of treatment days and relieved all or most of the pain in 94% of these days. Daily review of a symptom survey by a radiation therapy nurse, combined with a well-defined strategy for mouth care, and analgesics results in improved pain management of radiation induced oropharyngeal mucositis because of prompt attention to patient needs. Future trials should incorporate defined strategies for oral care and analgesic use to control for possible bias in assessing efficacy. © 1992.",Cancer pain; Head and neck cancer; Radiation therapy,"Janjan, N.

211,Prediction of delayed colonic transit using Bristol stool form and stool frequency in Eastern constipated patients: A difference from the West,"Background/Aims The correlation between the Bristol stool form scale (BSFS) and colonic transit time (CTT) has been reported in Western populations. Our study aims to study the relationship between BSFS, stool frequency, and CTT in Eastern patients with chronic constipation. Methods A total of 144 chronic functional constipation patients underwent colonic transit study by using radio-opaque markers, anorectal manometry, and balloon expulsion test. Stool diary including stool forms and frequency was recorded. Delayed CTT was defined as the retention of more than 20.0% of radio-opaque markers in the colon on day 5. Results Twenty-five patients (17.4%) had delayed colonic transit. Mean 5-day BSFS (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.34-0.79; P = 0.021) and stool frequency (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44-0.83; P = 0.002) were independently associated with delayed CTT by logistic regression analysis. Mean 5-day BSFS (area under the curve [AUC], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.84; P < 0.001) and stool frequency (AUC, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.63-0.87; P < 0.001) fairly predicted delayed CTT. The optimal mean 5-day BSFS of ≤ 3 provided 68.0% sensitivity, 69.7% specificity, and 69.4% accuracy, and the optimal stool frequency ≤ 2 bowel movements in 5 days provided 64.0% sensitivity, 83.1% specificity, and 84.0% accuracy for predicting delayed CTT. Conclusions Both stool form and frequency were significantly associated with delayed CTT. Stool frequency ≤ 2 and BSFS 1-3 rather than BSFS 1-2 that was used in the Westerners could be used as surrogate for delayed CTT in Eastern patients with constipation.",Bristol stool scale; Colonic motility; Colonic transit time; Constipation,"Jaruvongvanich, Veeravich; Patcharatrakul, Tanisa; Gonlachanvit, Sutep",2017,10.5056/jnm17022,0,200
212,The persistent effects of maternal infection on the offspring's cognitive performance and rates of hippocampal neurogenesis,"Accumulating evidence indicates that perinatal infection is a major cause of neonatal neurologic morbidity. Here we explored the effects of maternal infection on the offspring's cognitive performance and hippocampal neurogenesis. Pregnant rats were treated with Escherichia coli suspension and allowed to deliver. Proliferating cells in the hippocampus were examined at postnatal (P) 3, 7, 14, and 28. days and neuronal survival/differentiation was assessed at P28. Additionally, we examined the expressions of BDNF, TrkB and Akt. The cognitive performance of the offspring was assessed by the Morris water maze test. We found that maternal infection significantly impaired the offspring's spatial learning ability and spatial memory, thus could delay the cognitive performance development. Maternal infection significantly increased the number of proliferating cells in the offspring's hippocampus at postnatal 3, 7 and 14. days, accompanied by significantly increased expressions of BDNF, TrkB and p-Akt at postnatal 3 and 7. days. On postnatal 28. days, maternal infection did not significantly affect the neuronal and glial differentiation, nor any significant changes in the expression levels of BDNF and TrkB in the hippocampus. Our result suggests that the hippocampal neurogenesis level may increase during early postnatal period after maternal infection. Increase of BDNF/TrkB expression and Akt activity may be the contributing molecular mechanism. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Cognitive performance; Intrauterine infection; Neurogenesis; PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,"Jiang, Peifang; Zhu, Tao; Zhao, Wenting; Shen, Jue; Yu, Yonglin; Xu, Jialu; Chen, Xi; Yu, Huimin",2013,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2013.03.007,0,201
213,The consultation relationship-From transactional to transformative: Hypothesizing about the nature of change,"Increasing numbers of young children with significant social and emotional difficulties are being identified in childcare settings. Early Childhood Mental Health (ECMH) Consultation has been identified as a promising practice in stemming the tide of this troublesome trajectory. While ECMH Consultation is credited with promoting children's positive development, diminishing difficult behaviors, and reducing expulsion rates, the mechanisms of this transformative process are only beginning to be investigated. Recent research cites the salience of the relationship between a consultant and consultee as the central contributor to positive change in childcare-center climate and child outcomes. This article delineates characteristics of a beneficial consultative relationship and postulates the clinical process by which change in childcare providers' behavior occurs as a result of having experienced such a relationship. Paralleling the traits of contingent caregiving, the consultative stance, a posture of mutuality, reciprocity, and positive regard creates an intersubjective space for reflection, repair, and, when necessary, adaptation. Based on perceptual shifts or expansions, the providers' attitude and approach toward children in their care is amended, in turn promoting positive change in the child and classroom atmosphere. © 2012 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.",,"Johnston, Kadija; Brinamen, Charles F.",2012,10.1002/imhj.21332,0,202
214,Long-term effects of Head Start on academic and school outcomes of children in persistent poverty: Girls vs. boys,"Using various years of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and their two Child Development Supplements of 1997 and 2002, this study focused on the long-term effects of Head Start programs on academic achievement and school outcomes of children who grew up in chronic poverty after controlling for their home environments and neighborhood qualities. Findings suggest that (1) Head Start participation was associated with higher scores on Woodcock Johnson-Revised Test and decreased involvement with school suspension, expulsion, and grade repetition throughout all school years (from age 7 to 17) for chronically poor girls and that (2) home environments and parents' education are more consistent and significant determinants of children's long-term outcomes than Early Childhood Care and Education programs including Head Start. The findings of this study offer implications for policy and research. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Children; Early Childhood Care and Education program (ECCE); Head Start; Long-term effects; Poverty,"Joo, Myungkook",2010,10.1016/j.childyouth.2010.01.018,1,203
215,Drug administration via enteral feeding tubes in residential care facilities for individuals with intellectual disability: An observational study,"Background: The administration of oral medication to patients with an enteral feeding tube (EFT) is challenging. Compliance to guidelines concerning medication administration via EFT has been investigated extensively in the hospital setting. However, studies in residential care facilities (RCFs) for individuals with intellectual disability (ID) are very limited. Therefore, the present study aimed to collect direct observational data on drug administration practices to residents with EFT in multiple RCFs. Method: This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted in six Belgian RCFs for individuals with ID. Observations of medication preparation and administration through EFT were carried out in two randomly selected units per participating RCF, on 2 days per unit during all daytime drug rounds, using a direct observation method. Afterwards, the recorded observations were compared with international guidelines on drug preparation and administration through EFT. Results: In total, 862 drug preparations and 268 administrations in 48 residents with EFT were witnessed. Mixing together multiple drugs, not diluting liquid formulations with at least an equal amount of water, not shaking suspensions/emulsions before use, and not selecting the most appropriate dosage form were the most common deviations from medication preparation guideline recommendations. For medication administration, not flushing the EFT with at least 15mL water was the most common deviation. We also observed high variability in working methods regarding medication preparation and administration via EFT, even between staff members of the same unit. Conclusion: This study found that current guidelines concerning medication preparation and administration through EFT are often not followed in Belgian RCFs for individuals with ID. Further research aimed at understanding why current guidelines are not followed seems warranted.",Enteral feeding tube; Gastrostomy; Guidelines; Intellectual disability; Medication; Residential care facility,"Joos, E.; Mehuys, E.; Van Bocxlaer, J.; Remon, J.

216,Being a parent of the adolescent with complex chronic pain: An interpretative phenomenological analysis,"Background: Previous quantitative research has shown that parents of adolescents with chronic pain report elevated levels of emotional distress in addition to limitations in social and family functioning. Aim: This study aimed to further explore this parental impact by employing qualitative methodology to investigate parental experiences of caring for an adolescent with chronic pain. Methods: A sample of 17 parents/carers of adolescents with chronic pain was selected from two UK tertiary clinic sites. Participants were 11 mothers, five fathers, and one grandmother (primary caregiver). Four focus groups with parents/carers were conducted to discuss the impact of caring for an adolescent with chronic pain on the parent/carer. Transcripts were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Findings: Data analysis revealed two superordinate themes that captured the extensive, and largely negative, impact of being a parent of an adolescent with chronic pain. These themes were labelled 'struggle for control and coherence' and 'a very different life'. Both themes represent a fundamental parental struggle to adapt to a life very different than expected, a life fraught with uncertainty, fear, distress and loss. Conclusions: Parents who are unable to achieve the relief of their adolescent's chronic pain and suffering report significant personal distress that is exemplified by the repetitive search for legitimacy of their child's pain in 'diagnosis'. In the absence of diagnosis parents reported an unwelcome suspension in an unusual pattern of parenting, resembling the infant phase of parenting. © 2006 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.",Adolescent; Chronic pain; Interpretative phenomenological analysis; Parent; Qualitative,"Jordan, Abbie L.; Eccleston, Christopher; Osborn, Mike",2007,10.1016/j.ejpain.2005.12.012,0,205
217,Persistence and compliance of deferoxamine versus deferasirox in Medicaid patients with sickle-cell disease,"What is known and Objective: Patients with sickle-cell disease (SCD) receiving chronic transfusions of red blood cells are at risk of developing serious adverse effects. Iron chelation therapy (ICT) helps eliminate iron overload by binding with plasma iron to form a non-toxic conjugate that can be safely excreted from the body. Two iron chelating agents are currently available in the United States: Deferoxamine (DFO) is an injectable formulation, and deferasirox (Exjade®) is an oral suspension. This study compared the frequency of hospitalizations, persistence and compliance of patients with SCD from Medicaid programmes treated with DFO vs. deferasirox. Methods: Health care claims from Medicaid Florida (1998-2007), Missouri (1993-2008) and New Jersey (1996-2008) were analysed. Patients with continuous enrolment for ≥6 months prior to ICT initiation and ≥1 SCD diagnosis were included in the analysis. Patients were divided into four cohorts: patients treated with DFO (any-DFO group) and patients treated with deferasirox (any-deferasirox group); the latter was further divided into patients initiated on DFO and then switched to deferasirox (deferasirox switchers), and patients treated with deferasirox-only (deferasirox-only group). Frequency of hospitalization for crisis conditions related to SCD as well as length of stay pre- and post-ICT treatment initiation were assessed. Persistence was defined as time to drug discontinuation with ≥1 Rx gap, using Kaplan-Meier approach. Compliance was estimated using a medication possession ratio (MPR) based on the drug exposure approach. Adjusted analyses of persistence and compliance were also conducted. Results: A total of 217 (mean age: 19.4 years, 39.2 men), 275 (20.1 years, 41.5% men), 105 (19.4 years, 42.9% men) and 166 (20.4 years, 41.6% men) patients were included in the any-DFO, any-deferasirox, deferasirox switchers and deferasirox-only groups, respectively. After ICT initiation, the anydeferasirox and deferasirox-only groups experienced a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of hospitalizations relative to pretreatment [any-deferasirox: from 0.09 to 0.06 hospitalizations per patient per month (pmpm), P = 0.0105; deferasirox-only: from 0.11 to 0.07 hospitalizations pmpm, P = 0.0188], whereas it remained stable in the any-DFO group at 0.08 hospitalizations pmpm (P = 0.9483). The Kaplan-Meier rates of medication persistence assessed at 6 and 12 months of follow-up were significantly lower for DFO patients (6 months: 0.34, 12 months: 0.21) as compared to all deferasirox (0.51, 0.29, P = 0.0002), deferasirox switchers (0.56, 0.37, P = 0.0002) and deferasirox-only (0.47, 0.24, P = 0.0176) patients. Similarly, compliance to treatment was significantly lower for patients treated with DFO (mean MPR: 0.64) compared with any-deferasirox (0.78, P < 0.0001), deferasirox switchers (0.75, P = 0.0002) and deferasirox-only (0.80, P < 0.0001) patients. Adjusted analyses of persistence and compliance yielded similar results. What is new and Conclusions: Based on a Medicaid population, patients treated with deferasirox were more compliant and persistent with their treatment than those treated with DFO. Frequency of hospitalizations was significantly reduced after treatment initiation for the any-deferasirox and deferasirox- only groups. Prospective studies controlling for potential clinical and treatment pattern differences between deferasirox and DFO patients are needed to assess whether the decreased hospitalizations after initiation of deferasirox are related to better treatment compliance. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Compliance; Deferasirox; Deferoxamine; Persistence; Sickle-cell disease,"Jordan, L.

218,Age variation in life events and their relationship with common mental disorders in a national survey population,"Background: Life events (LEs) are recognised to be important risk factors for common mental disorders (CMD). Their prominence may vary across age groups but this issue has received little systematic investigation. Method: Data were analysed from the 2000 UK National Survey of Psychiatric Morbidity comprising 8,580 participants aged 16-74 years. A history of recent life events pertaining to health threats, bereavement, interpersonal problems and redundancy was established for the preceding six months. Participants were also asked about earlier lifetime stressors including sexual abuse and expulsion from school. CMD, depression and generalised anxiety disorder were ascertained through the revised Clinical Interview Schedule. Results: The strongest associations between LEs and CMD were for recent threats to health, recent interpersonal problems and lifetime stressors. Recent LEs were more strongly associated with depression than anxiety whereas the associations for lifetime stressors were similar in strength. The strength of association between recent LEs and CMD increased steadily up to the 45-54 years age group and then declined. In the 65-74 year age range, CMD was not significantly associated with any recent LE but instead was associated with the following lifetime stressors: bullying, sexual abuse, running away from home, and institutional care in childhood. Conclusions: Recent life events were most strongly associated with CMD in mid-rather than early or late adult life. In later life, stronger associations were found with lifetime stressors than recent events. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",Anxiety; Common mental disorders; Depression; Life events,"Jordanova, Vesna; Stewart, Robert; Goldberg, David; Bebbington, Paul E.; Brugha, Traolach; Singleton, Nicola; Lindesay, James E.B.; Jenkins, Rachel; Prince, Martin; Meltzer, Howard",2007,10.1007/s00127-007-0209-9,0,207
219,Expanding medical abortion: Can medical abortion be effectively provided without the routine use of ultrasound?,"Medical abortion studies have traditionally relied on ultrasound to confirm gestational age, intrauterine location and abortion completion. However, the routine dependence on ultrasound can limit access to safe services for women living in low resource settings that are often most in need of safe abortion care. This review discusses the literature surrounding the safe provision of medical abortion without the routine use of ultrasonography and concludes that clinicians can use the reported last menstrual period (LMP) and physical examination to reasonably estimate gestational age. Completed pregnancy expulsion can be confirmed primarily through history and physical examination with some studies indicating that urine pregnancy tests may also play a limited role. Central to the discussion of whether medical abortion can be provided in most low resource settings without the routine use of ultrasonography is the fact that the mifepristone-misoprostol regimen is a highly effective procedure for pregnancy termination through 63 days' gestation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

220,School-Based Mental Health Program Evaluation: Children's School Outcomes and Acute Mental Health Service Use,"BACKGROUND: This study examined the impact of school-based mental health programs on children's school outcomes and the utilization of acute mental health services. METHODS: The study sample included 468 Medicaid-enrolled children aged 6 to 17 years who were enrolled 1 of 2 school-based mental health programs (SBMHs) in a metropolitan area sometime during school year 2006-2007. A multilevel analysis examined the relative effects of SBMHs on children's absence, suspension, grade promotion, use of acute mental health services, as well as the association of child and school-level factors on the outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Little change in average number of days absent per month and no significant change in the use of acute mental health services were found. The mean number of days suspended per month out-of-school decreased from 0.100 to 0.003 days (p < .001). The percentage of children promoted to the next grade increased almost 13% after program enrollment (p < .01). Program type did not predict outcome changes except grade promotion. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the positive effect of school-based mental health programs on some school outcomes, the lack of difference between programs suggests the need to identify active mechanisms associated with outcome to make the delivery of care more efficient. © 2013, American School Health Association.",Acute mental health service; School context; School outcomes; School-based mental health program,"Kang-Yi, Christina D.; Mandell, David S.; Hadley, Trevor",2013,10.1111/josh.12053,0,209

Students in special education made disproportionately more threats, as well as more severe threats, than peers in general education. Students classified as emotionally disturbed (ED) exhibited the highest threat rates. Nevertheless, use of school suspension as a disciplinary consequence for threats was consistent for students in special and general education, and few students were expelled. Our findings support the use of threat assessment to manage threats of violence by students in special education.",,"Kaplan, Sebastian G.; Cornell, Dewey G.",2005,10.1177/019874290503100102,0,210
223,The impact of direct laryngoscopy on PET/CT scan results in newly diagnosed head and neck cancer,"Objective: Direct laryngoscopy (DL) with a biopsy, followed by positron emission tomography (PET) is an established staging protocol for newly-diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, inflammation and trauma from the DL could lead to false-positive PET and computed tomography (CT) interpretations. Therefore, we sought to determine the rate of false-positive findings on staging PET/CT scans perfonned soon after DL. Methodology: We reviewed all initial staging PET/CT scans performed at a tertiary care hospital over a one-year period for newly-diagnosed HNSCC. Index cases had PET/CT scans performed within two weeks after a DL. We selected controls with matched tumor locations that underwent PET/CT without a DL in the preceding two weeks. Results: We identified 17 patients with newly-diagnosed HNSCC that underwent a PET/CT scan within 14 days after a DL and biopsy. Scans were performed an average of 6 days (Range:1 -13) after the procedure. False-positive PET scan interpretations were observed in 53% of index patients, compared to 18% of matched controls. The odds ratio for a false positive PET scan finding was 5.6 (p=0.028) for index patients compared to controls. Conclusions: Performing a staging PET/CT shortly after a DL and biopsy can increase the rate of false-positive interpretations. Radiologists/nuclear medicine physicians and otolaryngologists should be aware of this possibility and communicate with each other to avoid misdiagnosis.",,"Karatayli-Ozgursoy, S; Ahn, J; Subramaniam, R M; Best, S.

224,The relationship between psychological distress and adolescent polydrug use,"Polydrug use is relatively common among adolescents. Psychological distress is associated with the use of specific drugs, and may be uniquely associated with polydrug use. The purpose of this study was to test the association of psychological distress with polydrug use using a large adolescent sample. The sample consisted of 10,273 students aged 12-17 years from the State of Victoria, Australia. Participants completed frequency measures of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, inhalant, and other drug use in the past 30 days, and psychological distress. Control variables included age, gender, family socioeconomic status, school suspensions, academic failure, cultural background, and peer drug use. Drug-use classes were derived using latent-class analysis, then the association of psychological distress and controls with drug-use classes was modeled using multinomial ordinal regression. There were 3 distinct classes of drug use: no drug use (47.7%), mainly alcohol use (44.1%), and polydrug use (8.2%). Independent of all controls, psychological distress was higher in polydrug users and alcohol users, relative to nondrug users, and polydrug users reported more psychological distress than alcohol users. Psychological distress was most characteristic of polydrug users, and targeted prevention outcomes may be enhanced by a collateral focus on polydrug use and depression and/or anxiety.",adolescent; alcohol; cannabis; polydrug; psychological distress,"Kelly, Adrian B.; Chan, Gary C.K.; Mason, W.

226,Study designs and challenges in clinical studies conducted in infants and children with asthma,"Because of the challenges associated with conducting clinical trials in pediatric patients, most drugs have not been adequately tested in this patient population. Insufficient testing frequently results in product labeling that fails to provide instructions for safe and effective use in pediatric patients. The most prevalent chronic disease in children is asthma; however, very few asthma medications have been evaluated in infants and young children. Budesonide inhalation suspension is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid administered by nebulization that requires only passive inhalation and is therefore suitable for infants and young children who are unable to use currently available inhalation devices for the administration of asthma medications. The efficacy of budesonide inhalation suspension was evaluated in 3 US clinical trials. All 3 trials were randomized, controlled, double-blind, 12-week studies in children (6 months-8 years of age) with a primary diagnosis of chronic persistent asthma. Symptom assessments conducted in both the morning and evening were the primary efficacy variables. Although the children were young, secondary efficacy evaluations included spirometry and peak expiratory flow collected in both the morning and evening (in a subset of patients capable of performing these maneuvers). Patients who completed or were discontinued from the 12-week double-blind treatment phase were eligible to enter 52-week, open-label extension studies. The design of these 3 studies confirms the feasibility of the performance of placebo-controlled clinical trials of asthma medications in pediatric patients and allows for efficacy evaluations based on symptom assessments together with pulmonary function testing.

227,Once-daily budesonide inhalation suspension for the treatment of persistent asthma in infants and young children,"Background: Inhaled glucocorticosteroids (GCS) are the most effective long-term controller medications for the treatment of persistent asthma. Currently, however, available delivery devices limit their use in young children. A nebulized formulation of budesonide has been developed to address the needs of infants and young children. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily budesonide inhalation suspension in children 6 months to 8 years old with mild persistent asthma not on inhaled GCS. Methods: Three hundred fifty-nine children were randomized to receive once- daily budesonide inhalation suspension (0.25 mg, 0.50 mg, or 1.0 mg) or placebo via a Pari LC-Jet Plus(TM) nebulizer for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included nighttime/daytime asthma symptoms, pulmonary function (subset of patients), rescue medication use, and treatment discontinuations. Safety was based on adverse events and assessment of HPA-axis function. Results: Demographics, baseline characteristics, asthma symptoms, and pulmonary function were similar across treatment groups. Mean nighttime/daytime asthma symptom scores were 1.19 ± 0.63 and 1.34 ± 0.53, respectively. Mean duration of asthma was 36.3 months and mean FEV1 was 81.3% of predicted with 27.7% reversibility. Following 12 weeks of treatment, all budesonide inhalation suspension doses produced significant improvements in nighttime/daytime symptoms (P ≤ .049) and significant decreases in rescue medication use (P ≤ .038) compared with placebo. Significant improvements (P ≤ .044) in FEV1 were observed in the 0.5- and 1.0-mg budesonide inhalation suspension groups. There were no differences between doses of budesonide inhalation suspension. Adverse events and basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels were similar among all groups. Conclusion: Once-daily administration of budesonide inhalation suspension was well tolerated and effective for the treatment of mild persistent asthma in infants and young children not adequately controlled with bronchodilators or non-GCS antiinflammatory treatments.",,"Kemp, James P.; Skoner, David P.; Szefler, Stanley J.; Walton-Bowen, Karen; Cruz-Rivera, Mario; Smith, Joseph A.",1999,10.1016/S1081-1206(10)62646-4,0,214
228,The effects of neglect on academic achievement and disciplinary problems: A developmental perspective,"The present study examines the effect of child neglect, alone and in combination with abuse, on academic achievement and school disciplinary problems for elementary, junior high, and senior high students. The sample included 324 neglected children and adolescents, and a matched nonmaltreated sample of 420 children and adolescents. All subjects were in grades K through 12 in a small city in New York state. The results revealed that neglected children did perform more poorly than their nonmaltreated counterparts, having lower grades, more suspensions, more disciplinary referrals, and more grade repetitions, even when controlling for gender of child and SES. Neglect alone and neglect in combination with physical or sexual abuse was related to lower grades and more suspensions. The combination of abuse and neglect had a particularly strong effect on the number of disciplinary referrals and grade repetitions. Abused/neglected students in junior high had the highest number of grade repetitions. The number of disciplinary referrals continued to increase through senior high for both neglected and abused/neglected students. Interestingly, the academic performance of all subjects dropped during junior high. Neglect and neglect in combination with abuse appeared to exacerbate a decline in academic performance that occurs as children enter junior high school.",Discipline problems; Grades; Neglect; School achievement,"Kendall-Tackett, Kathleen A.; Eckenrode, John",1996,10.1016/S0145-2134(95)00139-5,0,215
229,Home abortion - Experiences of male involvement,"Objective To gain knowledge about the male partner's experience of being present during an induced home abortion. Methods Twenty-three couples, whose male partner had been present when the woman aborted at home, were interviewed one to two weeks post-abortion. Results Each of the men supported his partner in her decision to have a home abortion, as this gave him the possibility of being near and of caring for her needs on the expulsion day. All the men were present and all their partners confirmed that they had been supportive. Half the men had been anxious prior to the expulsion, but most considered that their experiences during the expulsion had been 'easier than expected' and their dominant feeling was one of relief. Conclusions Abortion is an important life event. When taking place at home, it increases the possibility for the couple to share the experience. Sharing an abortion may have a positive impact on those men who lack a sense of responsibility regarding reproductive issues, such as contraceptive use. This could facilitate society's efforts to involve men as a target group in this field.

230,Home abortion implies radical changes for women,"Objective To gain knowledge about women's experiences, views and reactions regarding having a home abortion (medical abortion with the use of misoprostol at home). Methods One hundred women were interviewed one week post-abortion; this yielded both quantitative and qualitative data. Results The overwhelming majority of the women experienced wellbeing and were satisfied with their choice of abortion method. They appreciated the privacy and the comfort of being at home which also allowed the presence of a partner. The intake of mifepristone at the clinic was described by many in existential terms as an emotionally charged act, experienced by some as more difficult than expulsion at home. However, relief was the predominant emotional feeling during the expulsion day. Most women did not find it especially dramatic to see and handle the products of conception although some felt uncomfortable at the sight. Conclusion Given that they choose this method themselves and are well informed, women are able to handle the abortion process by themselves outside a clinical setting. The option to choose home abortion implies a radical change in empowerment for women. Also allowing them the possibility to take mifepristone at home would increase their privacy and personal integrity even more. © 2009 European Society of Contraception and Reproductive Health.",Existential moment; Home abortion; Medical abortion; Products of conception; Relief,"Kero, Anneli; Wulff, Marianne; Lalos, Ann",2009,10.3109/13625180903128609,0,217
231,Maternal care differs in mice bred for high vs. low trait anxiety: Impact of brain vasopressin and cross-fostering,"Brain arginine vasopressin (AVP) not only regulates male social behavior and emotionality, but also promotes maternal behavior, as has been shown in rats. In our CD1 mice breed for high (HAB) or low (LAB) anxietyrelated behavior, LAB mice have markedly less AVP mRNA expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus compared with HAB mice. Together these findings suggest that HAB and LAB mice represent a good model to assess the role of AVP in mouse maternal behavior. Therefore, we studied maternal care of HAB and LAB mouse dams and investigated the impact of maternal care on the offspring's anxiety in a cross-fostering paradigm. In comparison with HAB dams, LABs displayed less maternal care. Daily acute intracerebroventricular infusions of AVP in early lactation increased maternal care of LAB dams and acted anxiogenically. Cross-fostering on postnatal day 5 did not alter separation-induced high and low ultrasonic vocalization calling frequency, a measure of inborn anxiety, in HAB and LAB offspring, respectively. However, adult cross-fostered HAB mice displayed a trend towards decreased anxiety on the elevated plus-maze, which was still significantly higher compared with LAB mice. The low levels of depressive-like behavior, stress-reactivity, and hypothalamic AVP mRNA expression in adult LAB offspring were found to be independent of cross-fostering. In conclusion, the HAB/LAB differences in maternal care and anxiety are robust and strongly depend on differences in the AVP system. The seemingly rigid genetic predisposition to hyperanxiety can only be moderately attenuated by the received nurturing. © 2010 Psychology Press.",Anxiety; Arched back nursing; AVP; Depression; Genetic predisposition,"Kessler, Melanie S.; Bosch, Oliver J.; Bunck, Mirjam; Landgraf, Rainer; Neumann, Inga D.",2011,10.1080/17470919.2010.495567,0,218
232,The effects of temporally secondary co-morbid mental disorders on the associations of DSM-IV ADHD with adverse outcomes in the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A),"Background Although DSM-IV attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is known to be associated with numerous adverse outcomes, uncertainties exist about how much these associations are mediated temporally by secondary co-morbid disorders. Method The US National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A), a national survey of adolescents aged 13-17 years (n = 6483 adolescent-parent pairs), assessed DSM-IV disorders with the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Statistical decomposition was used to compare direct effects of ADHD with indirect effects of ADHD through temporally secondary mental disorders (anxiety, mood, disruptive behavior, substance disorders) in predicting poor educational performance (suspension, repeating a grade, below-average grades), suicidality (ideation, plans, attempts) and parent perceptions of adolescent functioning (physical and mental health, interference with role functioning and distress due to emotional problems). Results ADHD had significant gross associations with all outcomes. Direct effects of ADHD explained most (51.9-67.6%) of these associations with repeating a grade in school, perceived physical and mental health (only girls), interference with role functioning and distress, and significant components (34.5-44.6%) of the associations with school suspension and perceived mental health (only boys). Indirect effects of ADHD on educational outcomes were predominantly through disruptive behavior disorders (26.9-52.5%) whereas indirect effects on suicidality were predominantly through mood disorders (42.8-59.1%). Indirect effects on most other outcomes were through both mood (19.8-31.2%) and disruptive behavior (20.1-24.5%) disorders, with anxiety and substance disorders less consistently important. Most associations were comparable for girls and boys. Conclusions Interventions aimed at reducing the adverse effects of ADHD might profitably target prevention or treatment of temporally secondary co-morbid disorders.

233,"A multicenter, randomized, open label comparison of azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate in acute otitis media among children attending day care or school","OBJECTIVE This multicenter, randomized, open label study compared the efficacy and safety of azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate for the treatment of acute otitis media among children who were attending a day-care facility or school. METHODS Eligible children with acute otitis media from 21 US centers were randomized to treatment with 10 mg/kg of azithromycin oral suspension on Day 1, followed by 5 mg/kg once daily for the next 4 days or approximately 40 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin/clavulanate suspension in 3 divided doses for 10 days. Clinical efficacy was evaluated on Days 14, 30 and 45. Acceptance and convenience of the medications were assessed on Day 14 by parent interviews with a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS Of the 263 children enrolled in the study, 233 were evaluable at the primary evaluation 45 days after the start of treatment. Satisfactory clinical response rates (cure, delayed cure and improvement) were 60.5% in patients treated with azithromycin and 64.9% in patients treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate. Satisfactory clinical response rates at secondary evaluations were also comparable: 92.2% vs. 90.0% at Day 14 and 66.7% vs. 72.7% at Day 30 in patients treated with azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate, respectively. No significant differences in treatment failures, relapses or recurrences were noted with either medication. Azithromycin was significantly better tolerated and caused fewer treatment-related adverse events (7.2%) than amoxicillin/clavulanate (17.1%) (P < 0.001). In response to the interview and questionnaire, parents of children treated with azithromycin noted less need for special arrangements to give medication (2.0% vs. 14.9%). Children liked the taste of azithromycin (89.2%) and did not have to be forced to take the medication (2.4%). Parents of children receiving amoxicillin/clavulanate noted that 61.8% liked the medication and 19.4% of children had to be forced to take it. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that azithromycin was comparable to amoxicillin/clavulanate in achieving satisfactory clinical response rates in children with acute otitis media attending day care or school. Azithromycin was significantly better tolerated than amoxicillin/ clavulanate. Parents considered azithromycin to be significantly more convenient to administer and more acceptable to children.",,"KHURANA, CHANDRA MOHINI",1996,10.1097/00006454-199609009-00005,0,220
234,Making schools safe: A system-wide school intervention to increase student prosocial behaviors and enhance school climate,"The purpose of this investigation was to study how an intervention decreased violence, and created and maintained a positive school environment, and safe school building. Also, this investigation considered how an intervention impacted student learning and academic progress, and positive and appropriate student relating and problem solving among peers and with adults. A school-wide, prosocial behavior management system, The Project ACHIEVE Social Skills Program (Knoff, 2000), was used and the value of the program was determined using behavioral, observational, self-report, quantitative, and qualitative measures. Participants in the study were all school personnel, students in grades 3-6, and their parents/guardians in an elementary public school in an ethnically diverse school district. A similar elementary school in the district provided some comparison data. Pre- and post-intervention data suggested that the school-wide intervention was effective in improving prosocial behavior, in increasing students' appropriate and positive behavioral choices, in decreasing student disruptiveness in classrooms and common areas, and in decreasing disciplinary office referrals and suspensions. Implications of this field-based study are discussed in terms of applied school practice. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

235,Significant Improvement of Mobility Recovery in Acute Care Patients After Total Knee Arthroplasty With Liposomal Bupivacaine Injectable Suspension,"Purpose: The study objective was to compare the walking distance after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) between patients who received liposomal bupivacaine (LB) or a femoral knee block (control group) for pain control in the acute care setting and explore clinical and patient factors related to walking distance. Methods: This study included patients with a TKA between October 2011 and April 2014. The LB group was determined and matched to a control group using propensity scores. Clinical and patient factors were also evaluated in multivariable modeling. Results: A total of 268 patients received 1520 physical therapy visits. Compared with the control group, the LB group had 98 fewer physical therapy visits, had a significantly shorter hospital length of stay (mean, 3.1; standard deviation, 1.7; vs mean, 3.6; standard deviation, 1.6; P < .05), on the day of surgery had 7 times more patients walked and walked a farther distance (4.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-7.5 m; vs 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-4.4 m; P < .01).

The legal and ethical requirements for physicians reporting impaired pilots are discussed as well as practical recommendations for handling such situations. The argument is made that a physician's obligation to honor patient confidentiality should not take precedence over his or her duty to protect the safety and well-being of the airplane passengers and the general public.

237,Parental Perceptions of Adopted Children's Educational Outcomes,"This study looks at the educational outcomes of adopted children as perceived by their parents. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were performed using data from the 2007-2008 National Survey of Adoptive Parents. Our findings suggest that adoptive parents believe math and reading performance to be affected by special health care needs and household income. The odds of truancy and suspension are also believed to be affected by special heath care needs and gender. Though educational disruptions are infrequent, few adopted children perform at or above average in reading or math. These findings can be used to inform policy makers about post-adoption services. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",adoptees; education; outcomes; special health care needs; survey,"Knapp, Caprice A.; Woodworth, Lindsey; Ranka, Mehda",2013,10.1080/10926755.2013.787480,0,224
238,School-based health centers to advance health equity: A community guide systematic review,"Context Children from low-income and racial or ethnic minority populations in the U.S. are less likely to have a conventional source of medical care and more likely to develop chronic health problems than are more-affluent and non-Hispanic white children. They are more often chronically stressed, tired, and hungry, and more likely to have impaired vision and hearing - obstacles to lifetime educational achievement and predictors of adult morbidity and premature mortality. If school-based health centers (SBHCs) can overcome educational obstacles and increase receipt of needed medical services in disadvantaged populations, they can advance health equity. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature search was conducted for papers published through July 2014. Using Community Guide systematic review methods, reviewers identified, abstracted, and summarized available evidence of the effectiveness of SBHCs on educational and health-related outcomes. Analyses were conducted in 2014-2015. Evidence synthesis Most of the 46 studies included in the review evaluated onsite clinics serving urban, low-income, and racial or ethnic minority high school students. The presence and use of SBHCs were associated with improved educational (i.e., grade point average, grade promotion, suspension, and non-completion rates) and health-related outcomes (i.e., vaccination and other preventive services, asthma morbidity, emergency department use and hospital admissions, contraceptive use among females, prenatal care, birth weight, illegal substance use, and alcohol consumption). More services and more hours of availability were associated with greater reductions in emergency department overuse. Conclusions Because SBHCs improve educational and health-related outcomes in disadvantaged students, they can be effective in advancing health equity.",,"Knopf, John A.; Finnie, Ramona K.C.; Peng, Yinan; Hahn, Robert A.; Truman, Benedict I.; Vernon-Smiley, Mary; Johnson, Veda C.; Johnson, Robert L.; Fielding, Jonathan E.; Muntaner, Carles; Hunt, Pete C.; Phyllis Jones, Camara; Fullilove, Mindy T.",2016,10.1016/j.amepre.2016.01.009,0,225
239,"Montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, for the treatment of persistent asthma in children aged 2 to 5 years.","BACKGROUND: The greatest prevalence of asthma is in preschool children; however, the clinical utility of asthma therapy for this age group is limited by a narrow therapeutic index, long-term tolerability, and frequency and/or difficulty of administration. Inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled cromolyn are the most commonly prescribed controller therapies for young children with persistent asthma, although very young patients may have difficulty using inhalers, and dose delivery can be variable. Moreover, reduced compliance with inhaled therapy relative to orally administered therapy has been reported. One potential advantage of montelukast is the ease of administering a once-daily chewable tablet; additionally, no tachyphylaxis or change in the safety profile has been evidenced after up to 140 and 80 weeks of montelukast therapy in adults and pediatric patients aged 6 to 14 years, respectively. To our knowledge, this represents the first large, multicenter study to address the effects of a leukotriene receptor antagonist in children younger than 5 years of age with persistent asthma, as well as one of the few asthma studies that incorporated end points validated for use in preschool children. OBJECTIVE: Our primary objective was to determine the safety profile of montelukast, an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist, in preschool children with persistent asthma. Secondarily, the effect of montelukast on exploratory measures of asthma control was also studied. DESIGN AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We conducted a double-blind, multicenter, multinational study at 93 centers worldwide: including 56 in the United States, and 21 in countries in Africa, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. In this study, we randomly assigned 689 patients (aged 2-5 years) to 12 weeks of treatment with placebo (228 patients) or 4 mg of montelukast as a chewable tablet (461 patients) after a 2-week placebo baseline period. Patients had a history of physician-diagnosed asthma requiring use of beta-agonist and a predefined level of daytime asthma symptoms. Caregivers answered questions twice daily on a validated, asthma-specific diary card and, at specified times during the study, completed a validated asthma-specific quality-of-life questionnaire. Physicians and caregivers completed a global evaluation of asthma control at the end of the study. Efficacy end points included: daytime and overnight asthma symptoms, daily use of beta-agonist, days without asthma, frequency of asthma attacks, number of patients discontinued because of asthma, need for rescue medication, physician and caregiver global evaluations of change, asthma-specific caregiver quality of life, and peripheral blood eosinophil counts. Although exploratory, the efficacy end points were predefined and their analyses were written in a data analysis plan before study unblinding. At screening and at study completion, a complete physical examination was performed. Routine laboratory tests were drawn at screening and weeks 6 and 12, and submitted to a central laboratory for analysis. Adverse effects were collected from caregivers at each clinic visit. An intention-to-treat approach, including all patients with a baseline measurement and at least 1 postrandomization measurement, was performed for all efficacy end points. An analysis-of-variance model with terms for treatment, study center and stratum (inhaled/nebulized corticosteroid use, cromolyn use, or none) was used to estimate treatment group means and between-group differences and to construct 95% confidence intervals. Treatment-by-age, -sex, -race, -radioallergosorbent test, -stratum, and -study center interactions were evaluated by including each term separately. Fisher's exact test was used for between-group comparisons of the frequency of asthma attacks, discontinuations from the study because of worsening asthma, need for rescue medication, and the frequencies of adverse effects. Because of an imbalance in baseline values for eosinophil counts for the 2 treatment groups, an analysis of covariance was performed on the eosinophil change from baseline with the patient's baseline as covariate. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Of the 689 patients enrolled, approximately 60% were boys and 60% were white. Patients were relatively evenly divided by age: 21%, 24%, 30%, and 23% were aged 2, 3, 4, and 5 years, respectively. For 77% of the patients, asthma symptoms first developed during the first 3 years of life. During the placebo baseline period, patients had asthma symptoms on 6.1 days/week and used beta-agonist on 6.0 days/week. RESULTS: In over 12 weeks of treatment of patients aged 2 to 5 years, montelukast administered as a 4-mg chewable tablet produced significant improvements compared with placebo in multiple parameters of asthma control including: daytime asthma symptoms (cough, wheeze, trouble breathing, and activity limitation); overnight asthma symptoms (cough); the percentage of days with asthma symptoms; the percentage of days without asthma; the need for beta-agonist or oral corticosteroids; physician global evaluations; and peripheral blood eosinophils. The clinical benefit of montelukast was evident within 1 day of starting therapy. Improvements in asthma control were consistent across age, sex, race, and study center, and whether or not patients had a positive radioallergosorbent test. Montelukast demonstrated a consistent effect regardless of concomitant use of inhaled/nebulized corticosteroid or cromolyn therapy. Caregiver global evaluations, the percentage of patients experiencing asthma attacks, and improvements in quality-of-life scores favored montelukast, but were not significantly different from placebo. There were no clinically meaningful differences between treatment groups in overall frequency of adverse effects or of individual adverse effects, with the exception of asthma, which occurred significantly more frequently in the placebo group. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the frequency of laboratory adverse effects or in the frequency of elevated serum transaminase levels. Approximately 90% of the patients completed the study. CONCLUSIONS: Oral montelukast (4-mg chewable tablet) administered once daily is effective therapy for asthma in children aged 2 to 5 years and is generally well tolerated without clinically important adverse effects. Similarly, in adults and children aged 6 to 14 years, montelukast improves multiple parameters of asthma control. Thus, this study confirms and extends the benefit of montelukast to younger children with persistent asthma.",,"Knorr, B.; Franchi, L. M.; Bisgaard, H.; Vermeulen, J.

Sixty-four percent of the mothers reported using psychoactive drugs during their pregnancies. Eighty percent of parents reported an arrest during the time the child was growing up, 34% reported receiving treatment for an emotional disorder, and 14% were hospitalized. Four percent of the parents reported that their children had been placed in adoptive care, 9% in foster care, and 1 % had a child in a group home. Forty-one percent of the parents reported that at least one of their children repeated a grade in school, 19% were involved in truancy, and 30% had been suspended from school. Twenty percent of parents reported their children's involvement with the law, and 17% reported drug or alcohol use. Problems with the law correlated highly with 1) being held back a grade, 2) truancy, 3) suspension from school, 4) expulsion from school, and 5) treatment for alcohol or drug abuse. © 1994 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",,"Kolar, Anne F.; Brown, Barry S.; Haertzen, Charles A.; Michaelson, Barry S.",1994,,0,227
241,Clinical observations of nebulized flunisolide in infants and young children with asthma and bronchopulmonary dysplasia,"Severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is frequently associated with asthma. The combination is often severe enough to necessitate corticosteroid therapy. There are no commercially available nebulizer solutions of corticosteroids for use in infants and young children. Seven infants and small children with very severe BPD and asthma aged 6–24 months, were treated with flunisolide, 187–250 μg q.i.d. in the form of nasal spray delivered by nebulizer. After treatment for 2.5–20 months, four patients showed clinical improvement, one initially improved but later deteriorated and died of cardiac failure, and two patients showed no improvement and died within 3 months. The number of days of hospitalization was significantly reduced from 8.4/month to 2.5/month (P < 0.05). No side‐effects were detected and it was felt that the three patients who died, did so as a consequence of very severe BPD and its cardiac consequences. The suspension remained stable for 80 min when mixed with normal saline, cromolyn sodium, albuterol, or acetylcysteine. It is concluded that nebulized flunisolide is a potentially useful treatment for infants and young children with asthma and BPD. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

242,A longitudinal analysis of school discipline events among youth in foster care,"Youth in foster care experience major deficits on standardized measures of academic functioning, are at high risk of academic failure, and are more likely than their non-foster peers to be disciplined at school. School discipline-related problems increase risk of problematic educational and behavioral outcomes including dropping out of school, repeating a grade, and engagement in delinquent and criminal behavior. Identifying which youth are at greatest risk for experiencing school discipline is needed in order to improve the educational experiences of youth in foster care. The current investigation examined the effects of youth and contextual characteristics on school discipline events among 315 youth in foster care. Results revealed that being male, in a higher-grade, and a student of color, living apart from one's sibling, and school mobility significantly predicted discipline events. An additional statistical model divided youth into groups based on race, sex, and disability status taking into account the multiple identities youth have. These results suggest that gender, race, and disability status cumulatively inform school discipline experienced among youth in foster care.",Child welfare; Foster Care; School discipline,"Kothari, Brianne H.; Godlewski, Bethany; McBeath, Bowen; McGee, Marjorie; Waid, Jeff; Lipscomb, Shannon; Bank, Lew",2018,10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.07.017,0,229
243,Validation of prescriber risk indicators obtained from prescription drug monitoring program data,"Background Prescription opioids are commonly overprescribed. However, validated measures of inappropriate controlled substance prescribing are lacking. This study examined associations between prescriber risk indicators developed as part of a public health surveillance project and medical board disciplinary actions against prescribers. Methods We compiled 12 prescriber risk indicators using data from the Maine prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) for 2010. We used logistic regression models to assess the relative likelihood of the top 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% of prescribers on each risk indicator having been subject to medical board disciplinary actions, those citing inappropriate prescribing, or those involving license suspension or revocation, during 2010–2014, controlling for prescriber medical specialty and gender. Results The top 1% of prescribers for number of patients, opioid prescriptions per day, and opioid dosage prescribed per day had a greater likelihood of medical board disciplinary actions citing inappropriate prescribing, relative to a matched sample of other (non-top 1%) prescribers. Of the 56 prescribers in the top 1% for opioid prescriptions per day, nine (16.1%) were sanctioned for inappropriate prescribing, compared with 11 of 224 (0.5%) in the comparison group. The top 2% of prescribers for opioid dosage per day, and average distance patients travel to prescriber, had a greater likelihood of actions involving license suspension, revocation, or denial for renewal. Conclusions Measures derived from PDMP data may be useful in assessing levels of inappropriate prescribing of controlled substances in a population of prescribers, and in evaluating changes associated with efforts to influence prescriber behavior.",Inappropriate prescribing indicators; Medical board disciplinary actions; Prescription drug monitoring; Prescription opioids,"Kreiner, Peter W.; Strickler, Gail K.; Undurraga, Eduardo A.; Torres, Maria E.; Nikitin, Ruslan V.; Rogers, Anne",2017,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2016.11.020,0,230
244,Reasons for premature termination of dialectical behavior therapy for inpatients with borderline personality disorder,"Although one of the main aims of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) for borderline personality disorder (BPD) is to increase the retention rates, premature termination rates for DBT inpatient programs were found to be over 30%. The aim of the study was to identify the reasons for, and to analyze, patient characteristics that are associated with premature termination. We studied 541 inpatients with BPD, who were consecutively admitted for an open-door 3-month DBT inpatient treatment in Berlin, Germany. All participants completed several self-rating measures and participated in clinical interviews. Fourteen percent, who did not complete the full 84 days of assigned treatment, were expelled, mainly due to treatment-disturbing behaviors, or substance abuse or possession. Nearly 19% dropped out of treatment, mostly due to lack of motivation, arguments with others, and poor tolerance of emotional distress. Using non-parametric conditional inference trees, expulsion was associated with anorexia nervosa and alcohol abuse, whereas more than 9 suicide attempts, antisocial personality disorders, and more than 86 weeks in a psychiatric hospital were risk factors for dropout. We discussed measures and interventions that might lead to an adaptation of DBT inpatient programs. Future research should examine the symptom course and utilization of health-care services of non-completers. © 2014 .",Borderline personality disorder; Comorbidity; Dialectical behavior therapy; Dropout; Inpatient treatment,"Kröger, Christoph; Röpke, Stefan; Kliem, Sören",2014,10.1016/j.brat.2014.07.001,0,231
245,How to Identify Students for School-Based Depression Intervention: Can School Record Review Be Substituted for Universal Depression Screening?,"Problem: Early identification and intervention are critical for reducing the adverse effects of depression on academic and occupational performance. Cost-effective approaches are needed for identifying adolescents at high depression risk. This study evaluated the utility of school record review versus universal school-based depression screening for determining eligibility for an indicated depression intervention program implemented in the middle school setting. Methods: Algorithms derived from grades, attendance, suspensions, and basic demographic information were evaluated with regard to their ability to predict students' depression screening scores. Findings: The school information-based algorithms proved poor proxies for individual students' depression screening results. However, school records showed promise for identifying low, medium, and high-yield subgroups on the basis of which efficient screening targeting decisions could be made. Conclusions: Study results will help to guide school nurses who coordinate indicated depression intervention programs in school settings as they evaluate options of approaches for determining which students are eligible for participation. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Depression screening; Indicated intervention; School-based,"Kuo, Elena S.; Vander Stoep, Ann; Herting, Jerald R.; Grupp, Katherine; Mccauley, Elizabeth",2013,10.1111/jcap.12010,0,232
246,Developmental Hazards Among Young Alcohol Intoxicated Patients,"Purpose The rising numbers of alcohol intoxicated adolescents (AIA) treated in emergency care units in several European countries have drawn attention to this target group for prevention. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess a broad array of developmental hazards and their stability in AIA and to compare their distribution with representative samples (RS). Methods A multisite cohort study of AIA aged 13–17 years assessed, in the hospital (t0) and 6 months later (t1), (family) violence, cannabis and alcohol use, school problems, delinquency, homelessness, depression, and suicidality, using items from representative German surveys: Children and Adolescent Health Survey (KiGGS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and Communities That Care Youth Survey. We calculated the differences between AIA and RS and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. For AIA respondents who completed t0 and t1 information, we calculated prevalence/persistence/incidence of developmental hazards and corresponding 95% confidence interval. Results A total of 342 AIA participated at t0, 228 at t1 (67%). AIA had a significantly higher burden of concomitant risks regarding physical and emotional family abuse, (sexual) victimization, cannabis use, binge drinking, school expulsion, police arrest, gang membership, and being violent. Six months after hospitalization, emotional family abuse (34.1%), cannabis use (23.5%), depression (14.8%), and being violent (13.2%) were especially prevalent. Conclusions Developmental hazards are up to six times more prevalent in AIA than in RS. Therefore, when assessing the risk profile of AIA, it is important to consider developmental hazards as well as detrimental alcohol use.",Acute alcohol intoxication; Adolescents; CTC; CTQ; Developmental hazards; KiGGS,"Kuttler, Heidi; Schwendemann, Hanna; Reis, Olaf; Bitzer, Eva Maria",2016,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.03.022,0,233

249,"Health care financing administration's new proficiency testing rules: Use of a statistical approach to predict long-term performance using the categories 'successful,' 'probation,' and 'suspended'","Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 (CLIA-67) and the Medicare Act, the Health Care Financing Administration's proficiency testing rules apply uniformly to all hospital and reference laboratories. We examined the relationship between internal laboratory performance as characterized by bias and coefficient of variation and proficiency testing performance, categorized as 'successful,' 'probation,' and 'suspended.' Under the March 14, 1990, final rule, a laboratory with suspended testing for even one analyte may be required to cease testing in the entire subspecialty, eg, routine chemistry, unless it ceases testing for that analyte. Analyzing this regimen as a Markov process, we obtained the steady-state solution for performance for one to 27 analytes. While 1.1% of laboratories testing for five analytes with internal or day-to-day coefficients of variation at 50% of the CLIA-67 proficiency testing limit would be suspended, 19.5% of laboratories having biases of 50% and coefficients of variation of 33% would be suspended. We conclude that after eight events, there will be an unacceptably high rate of suspensions.",,"Laessig, R. H.; Ehrmeyer, S. S.; Leinweber, J. E.",1992,,0,236
250,A logic model for educator-level intervention research to reduce racial disparities in student suspension and expulsion.,"Disproportionate rates of suspension and expulsion, evident from early childhood, for students of color relative to White peers are a significant racial equity issue in the U.S. education system, with far-reaching effects. In this article, we present a logic model for educator-level interventions that have the potential to reduce disparate discipline practices and ultimately work toward a more equitable school climate. We describe how an integrated approach to supporting all children’s constitutional right to a free public education, which is prevented by exclusionary discipline practices, must purposefully integrate social and emotional learning, classroom management, cultural competence, and racial equity approaches that target educators. Together, the integration of these approaches has the potential to impact initial, intermediate, and long-term education outcomes by enhancing educators’ practices and raising awareness of their internal and interpersonal biases and role in perpetuating institutional racism in education. We conclude with recommendations for how this logic model can be used to guide future research to further our knowledge in this area to support educators in their practice and inform educational policy.

251,"Parents as Teachers (PAT) home-visiting intervention: A path to improved academic outcomes, school behavior, and parenting skills","The time from conception to young childhood is crucial in terms of brain-, social-, emotional-, and cognitive-development. Given the impact that parenting has on child developmental outcomes, home-visiting programs may be a viable means of improving parenting and thus increasing positive child developmental outcomes. Parents as Teachers (PAT) is a home visitation program that promotes parenting skills and abilities to improve parenting skills and child development outcomes. The current study used a matched comparison group quasi-experimental design and assessed three years of academic and school disciplinary data from a school district in Arizona to determine the impact of PAT on student reading, math, and English Language skills as well as absence rates and school suspension rates relative to a non-PAT group of students. Further, the study examined whether the program influenced parenting behavior. Findings indicated that compared to the non-PAT control group, the PAT student group performed better in terms of reading and math achievement and had a significantly lower rate of absenteeism, in-school-suspensions, and out-of-school-suspension. Further, PAT parents showed increased scores on parenting measures at post-test relative to pre-test. Taken together, findings indicate that participation in the PAT program is a viable means for improving child academic outcomes and school behavior and improving parenting behavior.

252,Pharmacokinetics of Phenobarbital in Microenema Via Macy Catheter Versus Suppository,"Context The oral route is compromised for nearly all patients approaching death. When agitation, seizures, or other intractable symptoms occur, a quick, discreet, comfortable, and effective alternate route for medication delivery that is easy to administer in the home setting is highly desirable. Objectives To characterize the early absorption profile, variability, and comfort of phenobarbital given in microenema suspensions delivered via the Macy Catheter® (MC) vs. the same dose given via suppository. Methods This was a randomized, open-label, crossover study comparing the early absorption profile of equal doses of phenobarbital administered rectally in three treatment phases: phenobarbital suppository and two different microenemas with phenobarbital tablets crushed and suspended in 6 mL (MC-6) or 20 mL (MC-20) of tap water. Results Mean plasma phenobarbital concentrations at 10 minutes were 12× higher for MC-20 and 8× higher for MC-6 compared to suppository. Concentrations achieved in 30 minutes via MC-20 took almost three hours to achieve with suppository. Mean AUC values were higher for MC-20 and MC-6 (82% and 46%, respectively) vs. suppository (P < 0.05). There was less variability in absorption for MC-20 and MC-6 (1.4- to 1.9-fold difference) compared to a 4.4-fold difference via suppository. MC administrations were reported as ""not uncomfortable"" compared to suppositories, which were reported as ""mildly uncomfortable"" (P < 0.05). Conclusion These results suggest phenobarbital oral tablets crushed and suspended in water and administered via the MC is superior to suppository in delivering the medication reliably and rapidly.",hospice care; phenobarbital; Rectal administration; suppository,"Lam, Y.

Previous research substantiates that the mental health needs of this population are significant, yet often go unaddressed in school settings. Preliminary outcomes for a sample of 61 children ages 4–22 suggest improvements in important school indicators, such as suspensions and absences during the year of program implementation, as well as positive changes in parent-reported mental health functioning. Lastly, parent satisfaction regarding these services and supports was high.

Methods: Prospective, evaluative study in a Level I trauma center. Mechanically ventilated trauma patients admitted with at least one additional risk factor for stress ulcer development received SOS for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Results: Sixty trauma patients were enrolled. The mean Injury Severity Score was 27.3. After starting SOS, there were no cases of clinically significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding related to stress ulceration. Baseline pH was 3.3, and mean gastric pH after SOS was increased to 6.7 (p < 0.005). There were no adverse effects thought to be related to omeprazole suspension. Incidence of nosocomial pneumonia after beginning SOS was 28.3%. The cost of acquisition plus administration of SOS was $13.13 per day, whereas the cost of drug acquisition alone was $3.83 per day. Conclusion: In a prospective, evaluative study of 60 trauma patients who required mechanical ventilation and had at least one additional risk factor for stress ulcer development, omeprazole suspension prevented clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding, maintained excellent control of gastric pH, produced no toxicity, and was the least costly medication alternative.",Omeprazole; Stress ulcer; Trauma,"Lasky, Michael R.; Metzler, Michael H.; Phillips, Jeffrey O.",1998,,0,241
255,Taxonomy of clinical encounters during the first 90 days post-delivery of an initial lower limb prosthesis,"Background: The incidence and etiology of prosthetic services utilization is poorly understood during the first 90 days post-delivery of the initial lower limb prosthesis. This period is of critical importance, as prevailing policy dictates limits on the reimbursement for certain services provided during this time period. The first step in understanding the financial ramifications of such policy is to examine the taxonomy behind clinical encounters during this tenuous time period. Objectives: Quantify and categorize clinical encounters by incidence and etiology. Study design: Retrospective chart review. Methods: A central database containing data on prosthetic services was examined. Incidence and etiology were extracted through independent review of each patient chart. Results: A total of 537 unique patients were identified, with 109 meeting the inclusion criteria. Chi-square testing showed that comfort (p < 0.05), cosmesis (p < 0.01), and mechanical failure (p < 0.001) yielded statistical significance in scheduled versus unscheduled visits. Stepwise regression analysis demonstrated that both sex and K-level were important predictors of unscheduled visits. Conclusion: Taxonomization of clinical encounters experienced during the first 90 days provides a framework for future studies to be conducted. The data provided can serve as a basis for informing reimbursement policy, workforce planning, and advocacy. Clinical relevance: Comfort is the most frequent reason for a clinical encounter during the first 90 days after delivering a lower limb prosthesis. The data on the taxonomy behind the clinical encounters can be used to guide workforce planning and advocate for just reimbursement policy that better reflect patient’s needs.",advocacy; Health policy; Medicare; prosthetics; reimbursement,"Lee, Daniel Joseph; Wininger, Michael; Mahler, David; Parisi, Mark",2018,10.1177/0309364618774053,0,242
256,"Correlation patterns between pretend play and playfulness in children with autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, and typical development","This study aims to explore the relationships between pretend play and playfulness in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), children with developmental delay (DD), and typically developing (TD) children. Twenty children with ASD, 20 children with DD, and 20 TD children aged 3-7 years 11 months entered the play conditions for the assessments of pretend play and playfulness. Data were analyzed using the Pearson correlation coefficient and a regression analysis. Results revealed that the play patterns of the ASD group indicated greater reliance on others to generate novel ideas of how to play. The number of imitated actions and amount of elaborate pretend play were positively associated with the suspension of reality and framing dimensions of playfulness, respectively. In the DD group, pretend play performance was more closely related to the internal locus of control of playfulness. The play patterns for the TD group, as expected, involved more symbolic play and internal control. The results of this study provide further understanding of the relationships between pretend play and playfulness in children with ASD, children with DD, and TD children. Assisting children with ASD to engage in elaborate pretend play through adult facilitation may help improve the framing and suspension of reality dimensions of their playfulness.",Autism spectrum disorder; Playfulness; Pretend play,"Lee, Ya Chen; Chan, Ping Chen; Lin, Shu Kai; Chen, Cheng Te; Huang, Chien Yu; Chen, Kuan Lin",2016,10.1016/j.rasd.2016.01.006,0,243

Data on school-age children (mean age = 11.79 years, SD = 3.26) were obtained from standardized assessments and parent and adolescent interviews during the New York City site's 3-year follow-up evaluation (N = 588). Moving to low-poverty neighborhoods had positive effects on 11-18-year-old boys' achievement scores compared with those of their peers in high-poverty neighborhoods. These male adolescents' scores were comparable to females' scores, whereas male adolescents in high-poverty neighborhoods scored 10 points lower than female peers. Homework time and school safety partially accounted for program effects.

261,Systemic inflammatory response syndrome treatment by powdered sorbent pheresis: The biologic-detoxification plasma filtration system,"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is one of the most common causes of death in intensive care unit patients. The detoxification plasma filtration (DTPF) system (HemoCleanse, Inc., West Lafayette, IN) combines the DT hemodiabsorption system in series with a push-pull pheresis PF system (a suspension of powdered sorbents surrounding 0.5 μm plasma filter membranes). Bidirectional plasma flow (at 80-100 ml/min) across the PF membranes provides direct contact between plasma proteins and powdered sorbents, as well as clearance of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6) at a rate of 15-25 ml/min, without evidence of saturation for 90 minutes. In a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved study we treated eight patients with SIRS and organ failure with a single DTPF treatment, using powdered charcoal as sorbent in four patients and powdered charcoal and silica in four patients. Treatments proceeded for 6 hours with proper heparin anticoagulation (activated clotting time 250-300 sec) and appeared safe. All patients improved during the treatments and each had increased blood pressure and decreased need for pressor agents. Plasma cytokine levels stabilized or decreased during treatment and were significantly lower the morning after treatment.

262,Salicylate toxicity associated with administration of Percy Medicine in an infant,"Percy Medicine is a nonprescription gastrointestinal suspension containing bismuth subsalicylate as the active ingredient (1050 mg/10-ml dose). A 3-month-old infant with colic developed salicylate toxicity requiring hospitalization in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) as a result of continued administration of this medicine. Bismuth subsalicylate has an aspirin equivalency conversion factor of 0.479 (approximately half the strength of aspirin). For 3.5 weeks the infant's parents administered the medicine, which provided the equivalent of aspirin 57-84 mg/kg/day with no reported problems. However, on the day of admission the baby presented with central nervous system depression and respiratory distress. Assessment at a local emergency facility revealed metabolic acidosis; his serum salicylate concentration was 747 mg/L. After acute management, the patient was transferred to our hospital, where he was treated with whole bowel irrigation and alkalinization therapy. Subsequently, the baby required 4 days of management in the PICU and 2 additional days of observation in a general nursing unit before he was discharged home without incident. The parents had chosen Percy Medicine based on the picture of a baby on the front of the package and because of its placement on the shelf next to a drug their family physician had recommended previously. Salicylate-containing products are not routinely recommended for children aged 1 year or younger.

264,Real-time subglottic stenosis imaging using optical coherence tomography in the rabbit,"Importance: Subglottic stenosis (SGS) is a severe, acquired, potentially life-threatening disease that can be caused by endotracheal tube intubation. Newborns and neonates are particularly susceptible to SGS owing to the small caliber of their airway. Objective: To demonstrate optical coherence tomography (OCT) capabilities in detecting injury and scar formation using a rabbit model. Optical coherence tomography may provide a noninvasive, bedside or intensive care unit modality for the identification of early airway trauma with the intention of preventing progression to SGS and can image the upper airway through an existing endotracheal tube coupled with a small fiber-optic probe. Design : Rabbits underwent suspension laryngoscopy with induction of of SGS via epithelial injury. This model was used to test and develop our advanced, high-speed, high-resolution OCT imaging system using a 3-dimensional microelectromechanical systems-based scanning device integrated with a fiber-optic probe to acquire high-resolution anatomic images of the subglottic epithelium and lamina propria. Setting: All experiments were performed at the Beckman Laser Institute animal operating room. Intervention or Exposure: Optical coherence tomography and endoscopy was performed with suspension laryngoscopy at 6 different time intervals and compared with conventional digital endoscopic images and histologic sections. Fifteen rabbits were killed at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 42 days after the induction of SGS. The laryngotracheal complexes were serially sectioned for histologic analysis. Main Outcome and Measure: Histologic sections, endoscopic images, andOCTimages were compared with one another to determine if OCT could accurately delineate the degree of SGS achieved. Results: The rabbit model was able to reliably and reproducibly achieve grade I SGS. The real-time OCT imaging system was able to (1) identify multiple structures in the airway; (2) delineate different tissue planes, such as the epithelium, basement membrane, lamina propria, and cartilage; and (3) detect changes in each tissue plane produced by trauma. Optical coherence tomography was also able demonstrate a clear picture of airway injury that correlated with the endoscopic and histologic images. With subjective review, 3 patients had high correlation between OCT and histologic images, 10 demonstrated some correlation with histologic images, and 2 showed little to no correlation with histologic images. Conclusions and Relevance: Optical coherence tomography, coupled with a fiber-optic probe, identifies subglottic scarring and can detect tissue changes in the rabbit airway to a depth of 1 mm. This technology brings us 1 step closer to minimally invasive subglottic airway monitoring in the intubated neonate, with the ultimate goal of preventing SGS and better managing the airway. ©2013 American Medical Association.

265,Academic and educational outcomes of children with ADHD,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with poor grades, poor reading and math standardized test scores, and increased grade retention. ADHD is also associated with increased use of school-based services, increased rates of detention and expulsion, and ultimately with relatively low rates of high school graduation and postsecondary education. Children in community samples who show symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity with or without formal diagnoses of ADHD also show poor academic and educational outcomes. Pharmacologic treatment and behavior management are associated with reduction of the core symptoms of ADHD and increased academic productivity, but not with improved standardized test scores or ultimate educational attainment. Future research must use conceptually based outcome measures in prospective, longitudinal, and community-based studies to determine which pharmacologic, behavioral, and educational interventions can improve academic and educational outcomes of children with ADHD.

266,Medical Expulsive Therapy is Underused for the Management of Renal Colic in the Emergency Setting,"Purpose Although the 2007 AUA (American Urological Association) guidelines established it as first line therapy for ureteral stones less than 10 mm, widespread adoption of medical expulsive therapy has been low. We determined the current penetrance of medical expulsive therapy guideline recommendations and the efficacy of medical expulsive therapy in reducing the requirement for urological procedures after emergency department visits for ureteral stones. Materials and Methods In a retrospective analysis of patients seen in the emergency department we included 2,105 emergency department visits associated with an ICD-9 diagnosis of urolithiasis in which computerized tomography abdomen/pelvis scan was performed. Outcomes were reviewed for spontaneous passage or required urological procedure. Results Ureteral stones were found in 48.8% of patients, including 50.0% in whom medical expulsive therapy was prescribed. There was no significant difference between patients who did and did not receive medical expulsive therapy. Within 12 weeks of the initial emergency department visit there was no difference in the rate of urological procedures performed in those who received medical expulsive therapy or in the rate of return to the emergency department. Patients treated with medical expulsive therapy experienced a shorter time to spontaneous expulsion (7.1 vs 12.8 days, p = 0.048). Conclusions Medical expulsive therapy for renal colic in the emergency setting remains underused. Half of the patients who met criteria for medical expulsive therapy in this study did not receive the standard of care. Patients treated with medical expulsive therapy achieved spontaneous passage more quickly but there was no difference in the requirement for a urological procedure. These results highlight the need for personnel at emergency departments to better standardize care for patients with ureteral stones.","emergency service, hospital; kidney; standard of care; ureter; urolithiasis","Loftus, Christopher; Nyame, Yaw; Hinck, Bryan; Greene, Daniel; Chaparala, Hemant; Alazem, Kareem; Monga, Manoj",2016,10.1016/j.juro.2015.11.026,0,252
267,Phase III controlled evaluation of sucralfate to alleviate stomatitis in patients receiving fluorouracil-based chemotherapy,"Purpose: Stomatitis is a major dose-limiting toxicity of bolus fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemotherapy regimens, despite the use of oral cryotherapy. Pursuant to preliminary data that suggested a sucralfate oral solution could alleviate chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis, we developed a prospective trial to test this contention. Patients and Methods: A phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed. Patients were entered onto the study at the time of the first cycle of 5FU-based chemotherapy. All patients received oral cryotherapy for 30 minutes with each dose of 5FU. In addition, each patient was randomized to receive either a sucralfate solution or a placebo solution to be used if they developed mouth tenderness or mouth sores. The study solution was to be used four times daily for 7 days starting on the first day of mouth tenderness or mouth sores. Stomatitis scores were determined by health care providers and by patients themselves. Results: There was a total of 131 assessable patients entered onto this trial, 50 of whom developed mucositis and used the study medication (27 sucralfate and 23 placebo). There was no suggestion of any difference in stomatitis severity or duration on either protocol arm. Conclusion: The resultant data from this clinical trial did not support the prestudy hypothesis that sucralfate would be beneficial for the treatment of 5FU- induced stomatitis.",,"Loprinzi, C.

Establishing effective discipline practices is critical to ensure academic success and to provide a safe learning environment. In this article, we describe the effects of whole-school positive behaviour support on discipline problems and academic outcomes of students enrolled in an urban elementary school. The whole-school model was designed through technical assistance consultation with teachers that emphasized: (1) improving instructional methods; (2) formulating behavioural expectations; (3) increasing classroom activity engagement; (4) reinforcing positive performance; and (5) monitoring efficacy through data-based evaluation. As compared to a pre-intervention phase, the whole-school intervention was associated with decreased discipline problems (office referrals and school suspensions) over the course of several academic years. Student academic performance, as measured by standardized tests of reading and mathematics skills, improved contemporaneously with intervention. Issues related to whole-school approaches to student discipline and the contributions of positive behaviour support are discussed.",,"Luiselli, James K.; Putnam, Robert F.; Handler, Marcie W.; Feinberg, Adam B.",2005,10.1080/0144341042000301265,1,254
269,School-wide discipline and the intransigency of exclusion,"School-wide discipline programs have existed for over 60. years. A commonality among most school-wide discipline programs is the use of exclusionary practices. Some programs use exclusions as a last resort while others use them as a first-line strategy. The exclusionary aspects of discipline programs became more popular in the 1990s with increasing school violence and Zero Tolerance. However, exclusionary practices such as suspensions and expulsions are often administered idiosyncratically, unfairly, and in an increasingly peculiar fashion. The purpose of this article is to provide an analysis and critique of school-wide discipline programs that employ exclusionary practices. Specifically, the research will be reviewed focusing both on the effectiveness of school-wide disciplinary programs and their impact on student and teacher behavior. Reasons for their widespread use will be proffered including the purposes and interests they serve for both teachers and administrators. Finally, recommendations for schools moving beyond the intransigency of exclusion and toward positive supports will be presented. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Exclusion; School-wide discipline; Suspension and expulsion,"Maag, John W.",2012,10.1016/j.childyouth.2012.07.005,1,255
270,Cost-effectiveness of histamine receptor-2 antagonist versus proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis in critically ill patients,"Objective: To examine the cost-effectiveness of using histamine receptor-2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Design: Decision analysis model examining costs and effectiveness of using histamine receptor-2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Costs were expressed in 2012 U.S. dollars from the perspective of the institution and included drug regimens and the following outcomes: clinically significant stress-related mucosal bleed, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile infection. Effectiveness was the mortality risk associated with these outcomes and represented by survival. Costs, occurrence rates, and mortality probabilities were extracted from published data. Setting: A simulation model. Patients: A mixed adult ICU population. Interventions: Histamine receptor-2 antagonist or proton pump inhibitor for 9 days of stress ulcer prophylaxis therapy. MAIN MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Output variables were expected costs, expected survival rates, incremental cost, and incremental survival rate. Univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the drivers of incremental cost and incremental survival. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted using second-order Monte Carlo simulation. For the base case analysis, the expected cost of providing stress ulcer prophylaxis was $6,707 with histamine receptor-2 antagonist and $7,802 with proton pump inhibitor, resulting in a cost saving of $1,095 with histamine receptor-2 antagonist. The associated mortality probabilities were 3.819% and 3.825%, respectively, resulting in an absolute survival benefit of 0.006% with histamine receptor-2 antagonist. The primary drivers of incremental cost and survival were the assumptions surrounding ventilator-associated pneumonia and bleed. The probabilities that histamine receptor-2 antagonist was less costly and provided favorable survival were 89.4% and 55.7%, respectively. A secondary analysis assuming equal rates of C. difficile infection showed a cost saving of $908 with histamine receptor-2 antagonists, but the survival benefit of 0.0167% favored proton pump inhibitors. Conclusions: Histamine receptor-2 antagonist therapy appears to reduce costs with survival benefit comparable to proton pump inhibitor therapy for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

271,The national practitioner data bank: Issues in plastic surgery,"Background: The purpose of this article is to increase awareness among plastic surgeons of the applications and implications of the National Practitioner Data Bank. Methods: A literature review using PubMed and Google was conducted regarding the history, function, and outcomes of the National Practitioner Data Bank, a federally maintained database of malpractice payments and disciplinary actions involving licensed healthcare providers. Particular attention was paid to institutional reporting requirements, the process of querying the data bank, and controversies regarding the effectiveness of the data bank as they apply to physicians. Results: Many physicians in practice and training remain unaware of the requirements of the data bank. Specifically, situations in which an institution must report to the National Practitioner Data Bank on a physician's behalf can be surprising, such as payment to a patient in settlement of written claim without the suggestion of malpractice, denial of additional credentialing, and suspension of privileges for greater than 30 days. Mandatory and voluntary querying of the National Practitioner Data Bank also varies among entities. A listing with the National Practitioner Data Bank can have consequences for licensure and credentialing throughout a physician's career, and reporting requirements begin as an intern. Lastly, it is not clear that the existence of the National Practitioner Data Bank has improved the quality of health care in the United States. Conclusion: Knowledge of the requirements and limitations of the NationalC Practitioner Data Bank is useful for plastic surgeons because of the diverse implications of its contents for their current and future practices. © 2010 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.",,"Mahajan, Ashish Y.; Stacey, D.

272,"Severe Sanctions, Easy Choice? Investigating The Role Of School Sanctions In Preventing Adolescent Violent Offending","Although schools in the United States adopted harsher disciplinary policies in the early 1990s, to date, there is little evidence showing whether severe school sanctions against student misconduct prevent crime. Drawing on both deterrence and rational choice theories, we test the proposition that harsh school-based policies against violence reduce students' involvement in violent behavior. However, in contrast to prior research that explores the direct link between sanctions and student behavior, we emphasize the role of school sanctions in adolescent cognitive decision-making processes, hypothesizing that school sanctions against violence condition the effect of thoughtfully reflective decision making (TRDM) on adolescent involvement in violent behavior. We use data from the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to test our research hypotheses. The results from a series of multilevel models show that more severe school sanctions against violence (i.e., home suspension and expulsion) disarm the process of cognitive reflection and attenuate the effect of low TRDM on violent offending. © 2012 American Society of Criminology.",Adolescents; School sanctions; Thoughtfully reflective decision making (TRDM); Violence,"Maimon, David; Antonaccio, Olena; French, Michael T.",2012,10.1111/j.1745-9125.2011.00268.x,0,258
273,Putting the Pieces of the Puzzle Together: A Mentalization-Based Approach to Early Intervention in Primary Schools,"An integrative psychotherapeutic approach which aimed to reduce the number of early school suspensions in children ages 3–7 is described. The Primary Years Project, a collaborative effort between the Anna Freud Centre and five public primary schools in London, England, seek to provide a comprehensive approach to early emotional and behavioral difficulties within the school environment. Several modalities of treatment were developed in order to accommodate the needs of young children and their caregivers. A vital component of the project was the emphasis on involvement and support of school personnel during the process of referral, assessment and intervention. A developmental psychodynamic approach framed all interventions with an emphasis on providing an ego strengthening experience. The use of the psychotherapist as a new developmental object was vital for the application of mentalization based interventions with children, parents and teachers. By focusing on the relational dynamics in the context of children's challenging behaviors, the project seek to activate participants' reflective functioning, thus promoting a more collaborative and mentalizing system around the child.

274,Maternal perceptions of pneumonia and pneumonia signs in Pakistani children,"Fifty mothers of children attending a hospital outpatient clinic with non-severe pneumonia (fast breathing but no chest indrawing) were interviewed in depth. Maternal perceptions and practices with clinical significance were documented. Results showed that most mothers initially tried ""heat-producing"" home remedies designed to counter the ""coldness"" of the disease, allowed only 2 days for any particular allopathic medicine to work, and did not go to the same practitioner twice. When mothers were asked what had alarmed them enough to come to the hospital, the symptoms named most frequently were persistent severe cough and high fever, inability to sleep and excessive crying. Fast breathing was spontaneously mentioned by only a few, although when questioned, 32/50 said that they had noticed it. The mothers who had prior experience with child pneumonia were more likely to notice fast breathing and also came to the hospital earlier than those who were inexperienced. Relatively higher levels of maternal education and income were suggestively associated with bringing a female child rather than a male child for pneumonia treatment. Fewer than half of the mothers knew where air goes when a person breathes in and where the lungs are located. Most held treatment preferences at odds with the protocols proposed for the national ARI program currently being initiated in Pakistan, e.g. they said that a doctor should use a stethoscope, should prescribe suspensions rather than tablets and should give injections. This study provides baseline data on attitudes and behaviors that can either be built on in that program or addressed through public education campaigns. © 1993.",Pakistan; patterns of resort; pneumonia; son preference,"Malik Kundi, M.

275,Individualized strategy for clopidogrel suspension in patients undergoing off-pump coronary surgery for acute coronary syndrome: A case-control study,"Objective: An increasing number of patients presenting for urgent coronary surgery have been exposed to clopidogrel, which constitutes a risk of bleeding and related events. Based on the wide variability in clopidogrel response and platelet function recovery after cessation, we evaluated the role of point-of-care platelet function testing to define the optimal time for off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in a case-control study. Methods: Three equally matched groups (300 patients in total) undergoing isolated off-pump CABG for acute coronary syndrome were compared. Group Awere treated with clopidogrel and prospectively underwent a strategy guided by platelet function testing. Outcomes were compared with 2 propensity score matched groups: group B underwent CABG after the currently recommended 5 days without clopidogrel; group C were never exposed to clopidogrel. Results: Patients in group A had reduced postoperative bleeding compared with those in group B (523-202 mL vs 851 ± 605 mL; P < .001) and a lower number of units packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfused during the postoperative hospital stay (1.2 ± 1.6 units vs 1.9 ± 1.8 units; P = .004). Postoperative bleeding and the number of units of PRBCs transfused were similar in group A and group C. There was no difference in blood-derived products and platelet consumption, mortality, or the need for reoperation among the groups. Patients in group A waited 3.6 ± 1.7 days for surgery. The strategy used for group A saved 280 days of hospital stay in total. Conclusions: The strategy guided by platelet function testing for off-pump CABG offers improved guidance for optimal timing of CABG in patients treated with clopidogrel. This strategy significantly reduces postoperative bleeding and blood consumption, and has a shorter waiting time for surgery than current clinical practice.",,"Mannacio, Vito; Meier, Pascal; Antignano, Anita; Di Tommaso, Luigi; De Amicis, Vincenzo; Vosa, Carlo",2014,10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.12.011,0,261
276,Central American mothers report family history of depression and alcohol abuse as a predictor of teenage health risk behaviors,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships of family history of depression and alcohol abuse as a predictor of health risk behaviors among Central American teenagers. Data sources: Demographic data were collected from a convenience sample of 101 Central American mothers with a teenage daughter ages 12-17 years who were living in Northern Virginia. The research questions assessed the family history of depression, alcohol abuse, and maternal depression. Scores were calculated to predict risk of teenage health risk behaviors. Conclusions: The Hispanic mothers in this study reported that their teenagers had significant health risk behaviors, including school dropout and expulsion, alcohol and substance use, pregnancy, and gang membership. Family history of depression and alcohol abuse in a first degree relative predicted teenage risk behavior 71% of the time. Clinical Implications: There is no consensus on a standard screening approach for depression in teenagers. Developing a standardized approach to gathering information from teenagers that includes genetic family traits may have significant effects on interventions for teenage health risk behavior and ways to provide the best services for vulnerable teenagers. The results of this study have implications for nurse practitioners caring for teenagers. © 2010 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2010 American Academy of Nurse Practitioners.",Acculturation; Alcohol abuse; Central American teenagers; Depression; Health risk behaviors; Hispanic; Latino,"Maradiegue, Ann",2010,,0,262
277,Family instability during early and middle adolescence,"Two studies investigated associations between family instability (changes in parents' intimate partners, work hours, residence, children's schools) and adolescent adjustment. In Study 1 (N = 141, M age = 15.23 years), instability was associated with increased caregiver-reported externalizing and internalizing behaviors (including youth-reported cigarette use), reduced teacher-reported frustration tolerance, social skills, task orientation, and lower academic grades. Logistic regression results for instability exposure showed an increased risk for school suspensions, Person in Need of Supervision status, binge drinking, and marijuana use. In Study 2 (N = 225, M age = 13.37 years), instability was linked to adolescent-reported externalizing and internalizing behaviors, teacher-reported disruptions, and lower English and math grades. Key sociodemographic factors and negative life events were statistically controlled in regression analyses. Results indicate that a more theoretically coherent measure of family instability, which is distinct from negative life events, may prove valuable in understanding the potentially adverse influence of instability on youth. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This in-depth qualitative analysis of 30 childcare providers’ accounts of expulsion finds a patterned process to expulsion: Teachers search for causes and solutions to challenging behaviours. When interventions fail, overwhelmed teachers shift their focus from ‘struggling’ children to ‘bad families’. Once the explanation of behaviour changes from within to outside of the child, expulsion is imminent. Interventions in teachers’ understandings, not only in children's behaviours, are discussed as a possible way to reduce expulsion.",childcare; preschool children; qualitative methods,"Martin, Karin A.; Bosk, Emily; Bailey, Denise",2018,10.1111/chso.12228,1,264
279,Vancomycin MICs for Staphylococcus aureus vary by detection method and have subtly increased in a pediatric population since 2005,"Vancomycin MICs for Staphylococcus aureus isolates in a pediatric hospital with a high rate of staphylococcal infections were examined for any increase over a 7-year period. A broth microdilution scheme allowed direct comparison of the MICs generated by this method to MICs generated by Etest. MICs generated by both methods were determined with the same inoculum suspension. One hundred sixty-five S. aureus isolates were selected on the basis of the patients having been bacteremic or having received vancomycin as the definitive therapy for their infections. Of the 165 isolates, 117 were methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 48 were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Forty-seven were acquired in the hospital (nosocomial), 56 were community acquired, and 62 were community onset-health care associated. All but one isolate tested by broth microdilution had MICs of <1.0 μg/ml, while 96% of these same isolates tested by Etest had MICs of ≥1 μg/ml. A significant increase in MICs that occurred after study year 4 (2004 to 2005) was demonstrated by the Etest (P < 0.00007) but not by broth microdilution. MICs were not different for isolates of community or health care origin, regardless of methodology. The proportion of isolates with Etest MICs of <1 and ≥1 μg/ml between children with bacteremia for ≤5 days and >5 days (P = 0.3) was not different. We conclude that MICs for pediatric isolates have increased slightly since 2005 and therapeutic decisions based on vancomycin MICs need to be made by considering the methodology used.

280,School violence interventions in the safe schools/healthy students initiative: Evaluation of two early intervention programs,"The Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative was designed to encourage collaboration among school districts and local community service providers in the provision of behavioral health prevention and early intervention efforts. These efforts would address the physical safety of students as well as provide mental health, violence prevention, and social skills services. One local SS/HS Initiative brought together community and school collaborators in an ambitious agenda that included 14 distinct programs that addressed the needs of over 110,000 students in a large school district. The purpose of the current paper is to report the results of the evaluation of two of the programs designed to reduce violent and disruptive behavior in schools. The programs include a school-based anger management program and a community-based, alternative-to-suspension program. Working in cooperation with program staff and the school district, quasi-experimental designs were used to measure change over time for students. The two studies demonstrate the application of multiple methodologies in evaluating the effectiveness of prevention and early intervention efforts with the aim of providing data to support program improvement and sustainability. © The Haworth Press, Inc.

281,DUI histories in intoxicated injured bicyclists,"INTRODUCTION It has been well documented that the use of alcohol correlates with injury risk, especially in DUI (driving under the influence) and DWI (driving while intoxicated). Consumption of alcohol in patients presenting with bicycle-related injuries is associated with greater injury severity, longer hospitalization, and higher health care costs. We hypothesized that intoxicated patients operating a bicycle with traumatic injuries have previous DUI or DWI convictions and had lost their privilege to drive a motor vehicle, resorted to bicycling, and had continued alcohol consumption despite negative previous consequences. METHODS We retrospectively collected data on injured bicyclists older than 18 years with positive blood alcohol content levels treated from the period January 2009 to June 2014 at a large Level 1 urban trauma center. We then matched each patient by name and date of birth and were able to obtain public criminal records through the Superior Court of California for the local of county. RESULTS A total of 149 injured bicyclists with positive blood alcohol levels were identified. Their average blood alcohol content was 236.0 mg/dL, and their average age was 41 years. Sixty-six (44.2%) of these patients had prior DUI/DWI convictions with suspension of driving privileges. Ninety-five patients in this group (63.8%) had no health insurance, and 51 patients (34.2%) tested positive for other drugs. Intoxicated bicyclists trended toward longer hospital length compared with nonintoxicated bicyclists (4.60 vs. 3.44 days; p = 0.07). Three (0.02%) of 149 patients were charged with bicycling while intoxicated. CONCLUSION Intoxicated bicyclists involved in trauma are more likely to have a previous DUI/DWI, have other drug use, tend to have longer hospital stays, and are less likely to have insurance. Bicycle safety education and behavior modification targeting DUI/DWI offenders are warranted. In order to promote injury prevention, resources to increase awareness of this underestimated public health issue should be promoted.

282,"Design, formulation and evaluation of novel dissolving microarray patches containing a long-acting rilpivirine nanosuspension","One means of combating the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is through the delivery of long-acting, antiretroviral (ARV) drugs for prevention and treatment. The development of a discreet, self-administered and self-disabling delivery vehicle to deliver such ARV drugs could obviate compliance issues with daily oral regimens. Alternatives in development, such as long-acting intramuscular (IM) injections, require regular access to health care facilities and disposal facilities for sharps. Consequently, this proof of concept study was developed to evaluate the use of dissolving microarray patches (MAPs) containing a long-acting (LA) nanosuspension of the candidate ARV drug, rilpivirine (RPV). MAPs were mechanically strong and penetrated skin in vitro, delivering RPV intradermally. In in vivo studies, the mean plasma concentration of RPV in rats (431 ng/ml at the Day 7 time point) was approximately ten-fold greater than the trough concentration observed after a single-dose in previous clinical studies. These results are the first to indicate, by the determination of relative exposures between IM and MAP administration, that larger multi-array dissolving MAPs could potentially be used to effectively deliver human doses of RPV LA. Importantly, RPV was also detected in the lymph nodes, indicating the potential to deliver this ARV agent into one of the primary sites of HIV replication over extended durations. These MAPs could potentially improve patient acceptability and adherence to HIV prevention and treatment regimens and combat instances of needle-stick injury and the transmission of blood-borne diseases, which would have far-reaching benefits, particularly to those in the developing world.",Antiretroviral; HIV; Microarray patch; Rilpivirine,"Mc Crudden, Maelíosa T.C.; Larrañeta, Eneko; Clark, Annie; Jarrahian, Courtney; Rein-Weston, Annie; Lachau-Durand, Sophie; Niemeijer, Nico; Williams, Peter; Haeck, Clement; McCarthy, Helen O.; Zehrung, Darin; Donnelly, Ryan F.",2018,10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.11.002,0,268
283,School-based clinic use and school performance,"School-based health clinics (SBCs) have been promoted as an innovative approach to providing adolescent health care. The present study examined the effect of a SBC on academic success. We studied the effect of clinic registration and use on students' absence, suspension, withdrawal, and graduation or promotion rates in an alternative high school for students who were not able to succeed in traditional educational programs. On average, these 322 high-risk students attended school only 56% of the time; 24% were suspended; and only 26% graduated or were promoted. The 189 (59%) students who were registered to use the clinic and the 159 (49%) who actually used the clinic were as likely to be absent or to be suspended as non-registered students. However, students who used the clinic were significantly more likely to stay in school, and to graduate or be promoted than students who were not registered for the clinic. This relationship was strongest for black males; those who used the clinic were nearly three times [odds ratio = 0.35; 95% confidence interval (CI) = (0.16-0.78)] more likely to stay in school than those who did not use the clinic. In multiple linear regression models predicting school performance, only clinic use and percent of enrolled days absent were significantly associated with graduation/promotion, and these two variables predicted 23% of the variance in promotion status. © 1993.",School-based clinic School performance Adolescent School dropout,"McCord, Marcella T.; Klein, Jonathan D.; Foy, Jane M.; Fothergill, Kate",1993,10.1016/1054-139X(93)90091-3,0,269

Commentators have acknowledged that they constitute a high-risk group to social disaffection and substance abuse. This paper reports on a group of 48 young people living in Belfast aged 13-14 years who are considered to be at a particularly high risk to substance abuse because they are excluded from school. The evidence in this paper suggests that many are already exhibiting potentially high-risk behaviours to problem drug use compared with their contemporaries in mainstream education.

This paper reports on the experiences of 77 young people excluded from school at year 12 when aged 15/16 years. They were participating in the Belfast Youth Development Study during the period immediately prior to the end of compulsory schooling. The findings provide a profile of the lives of these young people as they approach the developmental period referred to as 'youth transitions'. These young people reported high levels of antisocial behaviour and increasing detachment from the norms of mainstream society at a time when most young people are preparing to make the transition from adolescence to adulthood. This raises questions about the impact of targeted initiatives for addressing disaffection with school and their value for preparing young people for the transition to adulthood who may instead enter a period of NEET (Not in Education Employment or Training).",School exclusion; Youth transitions,"McCrystal, Patrick; Percy, Andrew; Higgins, Kathryn",2007,10.1080/17450120701534906,0,271
286,Exclusion and marginalisation in adolescence: The experience of school exclusion on drug use and antisocial behaviour,"Young people excluded from school are a group at an increased risk of drug use and antisocial behaviour during adolescence and later marginalisation and exclusion from society in adulthood. As part of the Belfast Youth Development Study, a longitudinal study of the onset and development of adolescent drug use, young people who entered post-primary school in 2000 (aged 11/12 years) were surveyed annually on four occasions. This paper reports on findings from this survey in relation to a supplementary group of young people who were surveyed because they had been excluded from school. The findings show higher levels of drug use and antisocial behaviour among school excludees, lower levels of communication with their parents/guardians, higher levels of contact with the criminal justice system and increased likelihood of living in communities characterised with neighbourhood disorganisation. This lifestyle perhaps suggests these young people are leading a life that is already taking them towards the margins of society. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",,"McCrystal, Patrick; Percy, Andrew; Higgins, Kathryn",2007,10.1080/13676260701196103,0,272
287,Associations between participation in a Physical Activity-Based Positive Youth Development Program and Academic Outcomes,"Introduction: Physical activity-based positive youth development (PYD) programs offer asset building experiences to foster the overall well-being of youth. These programs have the potential to enhance success in other important contexts for children, such as school. However, rigorous examination of this potential impact is needed. Methods: Propensity score matching was used to compare school outcomes among children who participated in a short, summer physical activity-based PYD program in the USA and children who were from similar backgrounds and from the same school district but did not attend the program. The sample included 149 pairs of students aged 7–12 years (M = 10.11, SD = 1.26) and, in each group, 62% were from ethnically diverse backgrounds, 38% were from primarily Caucasian backgrounds, and 80 were female and 69 were male, and birth years were equally distributed. Ordinal and logistic regression models were used to test for differences between standardized math and language arts test scores, excused and unexcused absences, and total suspensions and expulsions between the two groups. Results: PYD program youth had 55% and 46% greater odds being in the highest math (χ2(1, N = 298) = 4.06, p =.04) and total days attended categories (χ2(1, N = 298) = 5.58, p =.02) respectively. No other significant differences were found. When using a more rigorous quasi-experimental and longitudinal design, participation in a PYD program predicted some but not all academic performance and behaviors.

288,"Safety and efficacy of diaphragm pacing in patients with respiratory insufficiency due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (DiPALS): A multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial","Background: Non-invasive ventilation is part of the standard of care for treatment of respiratory failure in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The NeuRx RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing System has received Humanitarian Device Exemption approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of respiratory failure in patients with ALS. We aimed to establish the safety and efficacy of diaphragm pacing with this system in patients with respiratory muscle weakness due to ALS. Methods: We undertook a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial at seven specialist ALS and respiratory centres in the UK. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older with laboratory supported probable, clinically probable, or clinically definite ALS; stable riluzole treatment for at least 30 days; and respiratory insufficiency. We randomly assigned participants (1:1), via a centralised web-based randomisation system with minimisation that balanced patients for age, sex, forced vital capacity, and bulbar function, to receive either non-invasive ventilation plus pacing with the NeuRx RA/4 Diaphragm Pacing System or non-invasive ventilation alone. Patients, carers, and outcome assessors were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, ISRCTN number 53817913. Findings: Between Dec 5, 2011, and Dec 18, 2013, we randomly assigned 74 participants to receive either non-invasive ventilation alone (n=37) or non-invasive ventilation plus diaphragm pacing (n=37). On Dec 18, 2013, the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) recommended suspension of recruitment on the basis of overall survival figures. Randomly assigned participants continued as per the study protocol until June 23, 2014, when the DMEC advised discontinuation of pacing in all patients. Follow-up assessments continued until the planned end of the study in December, 2014. Survival was shorter in the non-invasive ventilation plus pacing group than in the non-invasive ventilation alone group (median 11·0 months [95% CI 8·3-13·6] vs 22·5 months [13·6-not reached]; adjusted hazard ratio 2·27, 95% CI 1·22-4·25; p=0·009). 28 (76%) patients died in the pacing group and 19 (51%) patients died in the non-invasive ventilation alone group. We recorded 162 adverse events (5·9 events per person-year) in the pacing group, of which 46 events were serious, compared with 81 events (2·5 events per person-year) in the non-invasive ventilation alone group, of which 31 events were serious. Interpretation: Addition of diaphragm pacing to standard care with non-invasive ventilation was associated with decreased survival in patients with ALS. Our results suggest that diaphragmatic pacing should not be used as a routine treatment for patients with ALS in respiratory failure.

289,Understanding the Discipline Gap from an Ecological Perspective,"This study investigated school exclusion's relationships with student characteristics, mother characteristics, parental involvement, school location, and service provision. The researchers examined data from 4,837 students in seventh to 12th grade extracted from a national data set. Multivariate results showed that student's age, gender, race, or ethnicity; mother's receipt of public assistance and full-time employment; meeting guidance counselor; no parental involvement in individualized educational plan; teacher contacts; and receipt of nonschool/ state health care services increased the likelihood of school exclusion. However, mother' s age and education level, non-English speaking, parental participation in school, and parental satisfaction with school reduced such likelihood. Implications for policies and intervention are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",,"McElderry, C. G.; Cheng, T. C.",2014,10.1093/cs/cdu020,1,275

291,Early intervention for preschool-age children with ADHD: A literature review,"Preschool-age children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at-risk for expulsion from preschool settings due to disruptive, noncompliant behavior. Removal from preschool limits the child's exposure to preacademic instruction, socialization opportunities, and the structure of classrooms. In this review, the authors evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological, parent training, and behavioral interventions designed to manage the disruptive behavior of preschool children with ADHD. Twenty-six experimental articles were reviewed. Pharmacological intervention, which has received the most attention, was found to be generally effective, although not without problems due to side effects. Parent-training methods were found to be effective in the home setting, but minimal information has been collected on the generalization of these findings to the school setting. Very little research has been devoted to the use of behavior management in the school setting, but results from those studies that have been done appear promising. Issues regarding future research and the use of these interventions to prepare the preschool-age child with ADHD for kindergarten are discussed.",,"McGoey, Kara E.; Eckert, Tanya L.; DuPaul, George J.",2002,10.1177/106342660201000103,1,277
292,Improving Behavior With Preschool Consultation: A Pilot Study of the TOTS Model,"Preschool children may exhibit a range of problematic behaviors that may impede development and disrupt classroom functioning. As a result, preschool children are often expelled from programs when behavioral issues cannot be adequately addressed. Preschool behavioral consultation serves as a promising alternative to expulsion, as consultants can provide teachers with the expertise and skills they need to manage current and future behavioral challenges. This article presents findings from a pilot study that examined the effect of a preschool behavioral consultation model in reducing inappropriate behaviors and improving prosocial skills in 35 preschoolers. A pretest-posttest design was used. Findings revealed significantly increased positive behaviors as rated by teachers and decreased teacher reports of behavior problems. Implications of these findings and the importance of behavioral consultation in the preschool setting are discussed. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,"McGoey, Kara E.; Rispoli, Kristin; Schneider, Dana L.; Clark, Barbara; Novak, Kandi J.Portz",2013,10.1080/10474412.2013.785180,1,278
293,Disproportionate exposure to early-life adversity and sexual orientation disparities in psychiatric morbidity,"Objectives: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations exhibit elevated rates of psychiatric disorders compared to heterosexuals, and these disparities emerge early in the life course. We examined the role of exposure to early-life victimization and adversity-including physical and sexual abuse, homelessness, and intimate partner violence-in explaining sexual orientation disparities in mental health among adolescents and young adults. Methods: Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, Wave 3 (2001-2002), a nationally representative survey of adolescents. Participants included gay/lesbian (. n=. 227), bisexual (. n=. 245), and heterosexual (. n=. 13,490) youths, ages 18-27. We examined differences in the prevalence of exposure to child physical or sexual abuse, homelessness or expulsion from one's home by caregivers, and physical and sexual intimate partner violence according to sexual orientation. Next we examined the associations of these exposures with symptoms of psychopathology including suicidal ideation and attempts, depression, binge drinking, illicit drug use, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, and drug abuse. Finally, we determined whether exposure to victimization and adversity explained the association between sexual orientation and psychopathology. Results: Gay/lesbian and bisexual respondents had higher levels of psychopathology than heterosexuals across all outcomes. Gay/lesbian respondents had higher odds of exposure to child abuse and housing adversity, and bisexual respondents had higher odds of exposure to child abuse, housing adversity, and intimate partner violence, than heterosexuals. Greater exposure to these adversities explained between 10 and 20% of the relative excess of suicidality, depression, tobacco use, and symptoms of alcohol and drug abuse among LGB youths compared to heterosexuals. Exposure to victimization and adversity experiences in childhood and adolescence significantly mediated the association of both gay/lesbian and bisexual orientation with suicidality, depressive symptoms, tobacco use, and alcohol abuse. Conclusions: Exposure to victimization in early-life family and romantic relationships explains, in part, sexual orientation disparities in a wide range of mental health and substance use outcomes, highlighting novel targets for preventive interventions aimed at reducing these disparities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Childhood adversity; Disparities; LGB; Psychopathology; Sexual orientation; Victimization,"McLaughlin, Katie A.; Hatzenbuehler, Mark L.; Xuan, Ziming; Conron, Kerith J.",2012,10.1016/j.chiabu.2012.07.004,0,279
294,Intramuscular methylprednisolone acetate for the prevention of relapse in acute asthma,"Study objective: To examine the hypothesis that an IM long-acting steroid injection will decrease the relapse rate of asthma patients. Design: A randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: The emergency department of an urban academic medical center. Type of participants: Acute asthma patients aged 18 to 45 years who were treated successfully in the ED. Interventions: Participants received either IM saline placebo or 240 mg methylprednisolone acetate suspension at the time of discharge. Measurements and main outcome: Relapse, defined as the need to seek nonroutine medical care for asthma within seven days of discharge, was the main outcome measure. Of 70 patients entered, 56 (80%) completed follow-up, including 30 in the steroid group and 26 in the placebo group. The groups had similar characteristics and peak expiratory flow values on arrival and at discharge. Relapse occurred in two steroid patients (6.7%) and eight placebo recipients (30.8%) (P < .05). There was one death in the placebo group. Reported side effects were similar.

295,Hyperlexia: Exceptional reading ability in brain-damaged children,"Twelve children who possess outstanding reading ability against the background of severe relamauun m otnci areas arc reported, i ne study involved 11 boys and one girl with ages ranging between five and one-half and nine years. Most of the children showed a lag in development with significantly retarded motor milestones. All showed the behavioral abnormalities of the hyperkinetic syndrome. In all of the children, however, the normal sequence of language development had suffered. In several, verbal language acquisition appeared to be progressing normally only to suffer an abrupt suspension generally as the result of some physical illness, injury, or psychic trauma. More often, however, no appreciable language was apparent until the parents witnessed the sudden emergence of a remarkable talent for reading. This generally occurred before the age of five, with two children demonstrating it before the age of three. Reading was a compulsive, ritualistic exercise, and the material was rendered in a stereotyped rhythm. Meaningful contact could occasionally be established by whiten instructions, suggesting some degree of comprehension. Abnormalities generally involved disturbances of the body image and spatial orientation. All showed severe retardation on psychologic testing, though reevaluation in one instance several years later gave scores within normal range. The results of neurologic examination were consistently abnormal with findings referable to unilateral or bilateral hemispheric dysfunction. This condition would appear to be a relatively unique disturbance of language development. © 1972 American Academy of Neurology.",,"Mehegan, Charles C.; Dreifuss, Fritz E.",1972,10.1212/wnl.22.11.1105,0,281
296,The effect of the essential oil of Eugenia caryophyllata in animal models of depression and locomotor activity,"Objective: The essential oil of Eugenia caryophyllata (clove oil; Family: Myrtaceae) is used in dental care as an antiseptic and analgesic. The present study investigates the effect of clove oil on animal models of depression and locomotion. Methods: Clove oil was administered in doses of 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 ml/kg/day, intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 3 weeks. The forced swim test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST) were used to assess depression. To evaluate locomotor activity, the rota rod test and the photoactometer procedure were performed. Results: In the FST, it was observed that the duration of immobility was significantly decreased (P < 0.01) in animals treated with clove oil (0.05 and 0.1 ml/kg); however, the clove oil dose of 0.025 ml/kg showed an insignificant increase in the immobile period. The TST demonstrated that pretreatment with clove oil decreases (P< 0.01) the immobile period significantly at all the three administered doses. Similarly, the photoactometer procedure showed increased locomotor activity at all the three doses, although significant (P < 0.05) only at 0.1 ml/kg. In addition, the rota rod test showed that animals treated with clove oil (0.1 ml/kg) enhanced muscle coordination as demonstrated by a significant increase (P < 0.05) in the latency to fall from the rota rod as compared to the control. However, the lowest administered dose (0.025 ml/kg, i.p.) decreased the latency to fall from the rota rod significantly (P < 0.05) compared to the control. Clove oil (0.05 ml/kg) also showed a decrease in the latency to fall from the rota rod although the result was not statistically significant. Discussion: Thus, it can be concluded that pretreatment with clove oil decreases depression and enhances locomotor activity similar to that exhibited by psychostimulants. © W. S.

297,Treatment of radiation-induced proctitis with sucralfate enemas,"OBJECTIVE: To report a case of radiation-induced proctitis treated with sucralfate enemas. CASE SUMMARY: A 77-year-old white woman was transferred from an acute care institution to our inpatient rehabilitation unit with impaired mobility and reduced activities of daily living. Her condition was secondary to myopathy and peripheral neuropathy associated with postradiation chemotherapy and metastatic ovarian carcinoma. During her stay, she developed hematochezia and pain secondary to a diagnosis of radiation-induced proctitis. Her hemoglobin had reached a nadir of 7.3 g/dL. The patient received blood transfusions and was started on 10% w/v sucralfate retention enemas 2 g/20 mL daily for 12 consecutive days. She was symptom-free at discharge, with a stable hemoglobin of approximately 10 g/dL. DISCUSSION: Proctitis is a common adverse effect of radiotherapy to the lower abdomen and pelvic area. Sucralfate is an aluminum complex that acts as a local cytoprotective agent against ulceration of the gastrointestinal mucosal lining. Rectal administration of sucralfate, as described in our patient and reported in published case studies, may provide an alternative therapy for patients with radiation-induced proctitis. CONCLUSIONS: Sucralfate suspension enemas provide a viable treatment option in patients who are intolerant of, refractory to, or not candidates for standard therapy for radiation-induced proctitis.",Proctitis; Sucralfate enema,"Melko, George P.; Turco, Thomas F.; Phelan, Thomas F.; Sauers, Nathan M.",1999,10.1345/aph.19065,0,283

299,A systematic literature review of the ‘managed move’ process as an alternative to exclusion in UK schools,"This paper reports the findings from a systematic review of research evidence on the use of managed moves as an alternative to exclusion in UK schools. The review begins by discussing the political landscape of school exclusion, the concept of managed moves and their use with children and young people (CYP) ‘at risk’ of permanent exclusion. During a systematic search nine papers were identified, reviewed and appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. A synthesis of the literature identified the most prominent factors relevant to successful integration of pupils following a managed move using pupil, parent and LA staff perspectives. Despite the paucity of research on the topic, this report finds there are key features associated with successful transition during a managed move. Developing new relationships with both staff and peers is key for CYP, in order that a sense of belonging is created for them in their new environment. Further factors supporting successful reintegration are effective communication between all stakeholders and a personalised and pastoral support plan for the CYP. This review holds relevance for those working in schools who may encounter CYP at risk of exclusion during their practice.",exclusion; Managed moves; pastoral support; successful integration,"Messeter, Tamzin; Soni, Anita",2018,10.1080/13632752.2017.1383676,0,285

Cluster analyses yielded six activity profiles: an uninvolved group ( n = 775, 31.1%), a multiply involved group (n = 247, 9.9%), a sports group (n = 469, 18.8%), a church group (n = 486, 19.5%), a school and community clubs group (n = 278, 11.1%), and a community clubs and sports group (n = 240, 9.6%). These profiles are differentially associated with academic achievement, problem behavior, and adult support. While some form of organized activity is generally associated with more positive outcomes, the school and community and community and sports profiles also report the highest levels of delinquency, drug use, and school suspensions.

Results of a series of multivariate odds-ratio analyses based on self-report from memories of childhood indicate that alcoholic women reported significantly more nightmares, bedwetting, temper tantrums, phobias, bruxism, and nervous problems than nonalcoholic women. They reported significantly more school-related problems including expulsion/suspension, skipping school, trouble with school authorities, and dropping out of high school compared to nonalcoholic women. Feelings of nervousness, loneliness, and embarrassment around peers were reported significantly more often by alcoholic women.

302,Emergency management of adrenal insufficiency in children: Advocating for treatment options in outpatient and field settings,"Adrenal insufficiency (AI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children with 1 in 200 episodes of adrenal crisis resulting in death. The goal of this working group of the Pediatric Endocrine Society Drug and Therapeutics Committee was to raise awareness on the importance of early recognition of AI, to advocate for the availability of hydrocortisone sodium succinate (HSS) on emergency medical service (EMS) ambulances or allow EMS personnel to administer patient's HSS home supply to avoid delay in administration of life-saving stress dosing, and to provide guidance on the emergency management of children in adrenal crisis. Currently, hydrocortisone, or an equivalent synthetic glucocorticoid, is not available on most ambulances for emergency stress dose administration by EMS personnel to a child in adrenal crisis. At the same time, many States have regulations preventing the use of patient's home HSS supply to be used to treat acute adrenal crisis. In children with known AI, parents and care providers must be made familiar with the administration of maintenance and stress dose glucocorticoid therapy to prevent adrenal crises. Patients with known AI and their families should be provided an Adrenal Insufficiency Action Plan, including stress hydrocortisone dose (both oral and intramuscular/intravenous) to be provided immediately to EMS providers and triage personnel in urgent care and emergency departments. Advocacy efforts to increase the availability of stress dose HSS during EMS transport care and add HSS to weight-based dosing tapes are highly encouraged.",adrenal insufficiency; endocrinology; glucocorticoids; pituitary-adrenal system,"Miller, Bradley S.; Spencer, Sandra P.; Geffner, Mitchell E.; Gourgari, Evgenia; Lahoti, Amit; Kamboj, Manmohan K.; Stanley, Takara L.; Uli, Naveen K.; Wicklow, Brandy A.; Sarafoglou, Kyriakie",2020,10.1136/jim-2019-000999,0,288
303,Childhood executive function continues to predict outcomes in young adult females with and without childhood-diagnosed ADHD,"We prospectively followed an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of preadolescent girls with ADHD (n=140) and matched comparison girls (n=88) over a period of 10 years, from middle childhood through late adolescence/young adulthood. Our aim was to examine the ability of childhood measures of executive function (EF) to predict functional outcomes at follow-up. Measures of EF comprised the childhood predictors, with academic, socioemotional, occupational, and global functioning serving as young adult criterion measures. Results indicated that childhood EF - particularly measures of global EF and working memory - predicted academic and occupational functioning across our entire sample (independent of diagnostic group status), but diagnostic status (ADHD versus comparison) moderated the association between (a) working memory and reading achievement and (b) a global EF measure and suspensions/expulsions. That is, in the ADHD group, low working memory predicted poor reading scores and impaired global EF predicted higher suspensions/expulsions, but this was not the case in the comparison group. Overall, these results extend previous findings of associations between EF and adolescent outcomes in girls with and without ADHD into young adulthood. Findings continue to suggest the importance of assessing and developing interventions that target EF impairments early in life in order to prevent long-term difficulties across a range of important functional domains. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); Executive function; Females; Functional skills; Girls; Outcomes; Young adulthood,"Miller, Meghan; Nevado-Montenegro, Adriana J.; Hinshaw, Stephen P.",2012,10.1007/s10802-011-9599-y,0,289
304,Preschool Teachers' Responses to Challenging Behavior: The Role of Organizational Climate in Referrals and Expulsions.,"Challenging behavior in preschool can lead to harmful outcomes for some children. While interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing or eliminating challenging behavior, evidence suggests that young children with challenging behavior are under-identified for services, increasing their risk for expulsion from early childhood programs. This study surveyed preschool teachers working in Florida Voluntary Prekindergarten (VPK) programs, to examine factors related to exclusion of children with challenging behaviors. Specifically, the study examined whether teachers' perceptions of the organizational climate of their workplace, including access to behavioral supports, the utility of those supports and the consequences of referral predicted teachers' responses to challenging behavior in their classroom. Results indicated: that teachers' perceptions of the availability of resources to provide behavioral support varied by program type; that the quality of supervisory relationships was significantly related to teachers' perceptions of availability of resources; and that teachers' perceptions of the availability of resources to provide behavioral support was a significant predictor of child expulsion from preschool. The results of this study have implications for increasing the availability of behavioral supports and high quality supervision, as means of stemming the tide of expulsions of children from preschool programs.",Aggression; Teacher Attitudes; Educational Environment; Teacher Surveys; Behavior Problems; Statistical Analysis; Check Lists; Predictor Variables; Preschool Teachers; Multiple Regression Analysis; Organizational Climate; Referral; Expulsion; Child Behavior,"Miller, Shauna; Smith-Bonahue, Tina; Kemple, Kristen",2017,,1,290
305,Effects of repeated maternal separation on anxiety- and depression-related phenotypes in different mouse strains,"Genetic factors and early life adversity both play a major role in the etiology of mood and anxiety disorders. Previous studies have shown that postnatal maternal separation (MS) can produce lasting abnormalities in emotion-related behavior and neuroendocrine responses to stress in rodents. The present study sought to examine the effects of repeated MS in eight different inbred strains of mice (129S1/SvImJ, 129P3/J, A/J, BALB/cJ, BALB/cByJ C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, FVB/NJ). Pups were separated from their dam and littermates for 180 min/day ('MS') or 15 min/day ('handling'), or left undisturbed ('facility-reared') from postnatal days P0-P13, and tested as adults for anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. Results demonstrated no clear and consistent effects of MS or handling on behavioral phenotypes in any of the strains tested. In all strains, MS produced an increase in maternal care on reunion with pups, which may have modified MS effects. Data demonstrate that the MS procedure employed does not provide a robust model of early life stress effects on the anxiety- and depression-related behaviors in the mouse strains tested.",Anxiety; Depression; Early life; Gene; Handling; Inbred; Maternal separation; Mouse; Postnatal; Strain; Stress,"Millstein, Rachel A.; Holmes, Andrew",2007,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2006.05.003,0,291
306,"Randomized, open-label, parallel-group evaluations of basal-bolus therapy versus insulin lispro premixed therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus failing to achieve control with starter insulin treatment and continuing oral antihyperglycemic drugs: A noninferiority intensification substudy of the DURABLE trial","Background: Insulin glargine and lispro mix 75/25 (75% insulin lispro protamine suspension and 25% insulin lispro injection [LM75/25]) represent 2 common starter insulin regimen classes: basal and premixed. After initiation of starter insulin therapy, if patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) are unable to achieve a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level <7.0%, insulin intensification may be indicated. The DURABLE (Assessing Durability of Basal Versus Lispro Mix 75/25 Insulin Efficacy) trial was designed to compare initiating insulin therapy with analogue basal insulin versus premixed analogue insulin in patients unable to achieve good glycemic control while taking multiple oral antihyperglycemic drugs (OADs).Objective: To provide objective information about insulin intensification, the DURABLE trial also included a substudy evaluating a systematic approach to advancing insulin therapy in those patients who did not achieve glycemic control with their initial insulin regimen. This substudy, the results of which are reported here, tested the hypothesis that advancing insulin therapy with premixed insulin is noninferior to basal-bolus therapy (BBT) in patients with type 2 DM unable to achieve an HbA1c level ≤7.0% after 6 months of starter insulin therapy.Methods: In the main DURABLE study, 2091 patients (age range, 30-80 years) with type 2 DM and HbA1c values >7.0% receiving ≥2 OADs were randomized to receive insulin glargine (n = 1046) or LM75/25 (n = 1045), both in combination with prestudy OADs. After 6 months, patients with HbA1c levels >7.0% could enter this intensification substudy; OADs except sulfonylureas were continued. Patients originally receiving insulin glargine were enrolled in intensification arm A and were randomized to receive BBT (insulin glargine once daily plus mealtime insulin lispro TID) or LM75/25 BID. Patients originally receiving LM75/25 were enrolled in intensification arm B and randomized to receive BBT or mealtime 50% insulin lispro protamine suspension and 50% insulin lispro injection (LM50/50) TID. Insulin doses were adjusted based on preprandial plasma glucose levels. The primary end point was noninferiority of premixed therapy versus BBT with respect to end-point HbA1c. Secondary end points included change in HbA1c and weight, percentage of patients reaching HbA1c target levels, total daily insulin dose, and rates of hypoglycemia. The safety profile was also assessed.Results: Of the 475 patients in the insulin glargine + OAD arm of the main study who had HbA1c levels >7.0% at 6 months, 399 (84%) entered intensification arm A. The mean age was 57 years, 53% of the patients were male, and mean (SD) HbA1c was 8.0% (1.0%) at baseline. Of those patients, 199 were randomly assigned to receive BBT and 200 were assigned to receive LM75/25. Of the 411 patients in the LM75/25 + OAD arm of the main study who had an HbA1c level >7.0% at 6 months, 345 (84%) entered intensification arm B. The mean age was 55 years, 51% of the patients were male, and mean (SD) HbA1c was 8.0% (0.9%) at baseline. Of those patients, 171 were randomly assigned to receive BBT and 174 were assigned to receive LM50/50. At end point, noninferiority of LM75/25 or LM50/50 to BBT was supported, with a 95% CI of -0.10 to 0.37 and -0.25 to 0.25, respectively. At 6 months, HbA1c did not differ significantly from baseline in any group. Regardless of treatment group, <20% of patients achieved an HbA1c level <7.0%. There were no significant differences between groups in total daily insulin dose, weight gain, incidence or rate of hypoglycemia, or incidence of serious adverse events.Conclusions: No group had significant improvement from baseline in HbA1c. Our study results suggest that premixed therapy, dosed 2 times per day (LM75/25) or 3 times per day (LM50/50), was noninferior to BBT (4 injections/d) in this population of adult patients with type 2 DM previously uncontrolled with OADs plus basal insulin or twice-daily premixed insulin.

307,A Downward Spiral? Childhood Suspension and the Path to Juvenile Arrest,"There is growing concern that suspensions trigger a ‘‘downward spiral,’’ redirecting children’s trajectories away from school success and toward police contact. The current study tests this possibility, analyzing whether and in what ways childhood suspensions increase children’s risk for juvenile arrests. Combining 15 years of data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study with contextual information on neighborhoods and schools, I find that suspensions disproportionately affect children already enduring considerable adversity. Even so, suspensions appear to redirect children’s trajectories, more than doubling their risk of arrest. Although suspended children experienced greater escalations in behavioral problems than their peers, post-suspension behavioral changes explained relatively little of the association between early suspension and later arrest. Instead, the most consequential way suspended children diverged from their peers was their heightened risk for repeated school sanction. Suspended children’s risk for repeated school removal explained 52 percent of the association between childhood suspension and juvenile arrest.",exclusionary discipline; Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study; juvenile justice; school-to-prison pipeline,"Mittleman, Joel",2018,10.1177/0038040718784603,1,293

The current study moves the field forward by analyzing a survey of a diverse sample of 2539 students in 10th to 12th grade in Southern California to examine how demographic, individual, and family factors contribute to disparities in office referral and suspension/expulsion. African Americans, boys, and students whose parents had less education were more likely to be suspended/expelled. Higher levels of student academic preparation for class, hours spent on homework, and academic aspiration were associated with less school discipline. Findings suggest that helping students engage in school may be protective against disproportionate school discipline.",Disciplinary disparities; Disproportionality; Expulsion; Out-of-school suspension; School discipline,"Mizel, Matthew L.; Miles, Jeremy N.V.; Pedersen, Eric R.; Tucker, Joan S.; Ewing, Brett A.; D'Amico, Elizabeth J.",2016,10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.09.009,1,294
309,Microbially mediated abiotic transformation of the antimicrobial agent sulfamethoxazole under iron-reducing soil conditions,"Large quantities of antimicrobial agents used in livestock production are released to soils by land application of manure, but only limited information is available on mechanisms that contribute to antimicrobial fate in soils under variable biogeochemical conditions. Dissipation of the sulfonamide antimicrobial sulfamethoxazole was examined in soil microcosms incubated under different terminal electron-accepting conditions (aerobic, nitrate-reducing, Fe(III)-reducing, and sulfate-reducing). Somewhat unexpectedly, sulfamethoxazole dissipation was fastest under Fe(III)-reducing conditions, with concentrations decreasing by >95% within 1 day. The rapid transformation was attributed to abiotic reactions between sulfamethoxazole and Fe(II) generated by microbial reduction of Fe(III) soil minerals. Separate experiments demonstrated that sulfamethoxazole was abiotically transformed in Fe(II)-amended aqueous suspensions of goethite (α-FeOOH(s)), and observed rate constants varied with the extent of Fe(II) sorption to goethite. Sulfamethoxazole transformation is initiated by a 1-electron reductive cleavage of the N-O bond in the isoxazole ring substituent, and observed products are consistent with Fe(II)-mediated reduction and isomerization processes. These findings reveal potentially important, but previously unrecognized, pathways that may contribute to the fate of sulfamethoxazole and related chemicals in reducing soil environments. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Mohatt, Jessica L.; Hu, Lanhua; Finneran, Kevin T.; Strathmann, Timothy J.",2011,10.1021/es200413g,0,295
310,Prospective evaluation of light scatter technology paired with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry for rapid diagnosis of urinary tract infections,"Urinary tract infections are one of the most common reasons for health care visits. Diagnosis and optimal treatment often require a urine culture, which takes an average of 1.5 to 2 days from urine collection to results, delaying optimal therapy. Faster, but accurate, alternatives are needed. Light scatter technology has been proposed for several years as a rapid screening tool, whereby negative specimens are excluded from culture. A commercially available light scatter device, BacterioScan 216Dx (BacterioScan, Inc.), has recently been advertised for this application. Paired use of mass spectrometry (MS) for bacterial identification and automated-system-based susceptibility testing straight from the light scatter suspension might provide dramatic improvement in times to a result. The present study prospectively evaluated the BacterioScan device, with culture as the reference standard. Positive light scatter specimens were used for downstream rapid matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS organism identification and automated-system-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Prospective evaluation of 439 urine samples showed a sensitivity of 96.5%, a specificity of 71.4%, and positive and negative predictive values of 45.1% and 98.8%, respectively. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of the suspension after density-based selection yielded a sensitivity of 72.1% and a specificity of 96.9%. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the samples identified by MALDI-TOF MS produced an overall categorical agreement of 99.2%. Given the high sensitivity and negative predictive value of results obtained, BacterioScan 216Dx is a reasonable approach for urine screening and might produce negative results in as few as 3 h, with no downstream workup. Paired rapid identification and susceptibility testing might be useful when MALDI-TOF MS results in an organism identification, and it might decrease the time to a result by more than 24 h.",Mass spectrometry; Susceptibility testing; Urinary tract infection,"Montgomery, Sandra; Roman, Kiana; Ngyuen, Lan; Cardenas, Ana Maria; Knox, James; Tomaras, Andrew P.; Graf, Erin H.",2017,10.1128/JCM.00027-17,0,296
311,Are students with disabilities suspended more frequently than otherwise similar students without disabilities?,"Students with disabilities (SWD) have been reported to be disproportionately suspended from U.S. schools and so more likely to experience the “school-to-prison pipeline” through suspension's associations with lower academic achievement, dropout, juvenile delinquency, and adult criminality. Yet few studies have estimated SWD's risk of more frequent suspension while simultaneously controlling for potential confounds. Negative binomial regression modeling of suspension count data from a nationally representative and longitudinal sample (N = 6,740) indicated that males, those from lower resourced families, and students attending more economically segregated schools were more frequently suspended. On average, students who are Black received about 1.6 times as many suspensions by the end of 8th grade as otherwise similar White students. In contrast, having a disability by 1st grade was not a risk factor for more frequent suspension by the end of 8th grade while simultaneously accounting for other risk factors (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity, family SES, prior history of externalizing problem behaviors, being from a English-speaking household, school-level economic composition). Students with specific disability conditions (e.g., emotional disturbances, speech or language impairments) were not at increased risk for more frequent suspension. Students with disabilities who are Black, Hispanic, or of other race/ethnicity were not more frequently suspended than SWD who are White.",Disparities; Longitudinal; Racial/ethnic minorities; School-to-prison pipeline; Special education; Suspension,"Morgan, Paul L.; Farkas, George; Hillemeier, Marianne M.; Wang, Yangyang; Mandel, Zoe; DeJarnett, Christopher; Maczuga, Steve",2019,10.1016/j.jsp.2018.11.001,1,297
312,Early school-age outcomes of late preterm infants,"OBJECTIVE. Late preterm infants represent a significant portion of preterm deliveries. Until recently, these infants have received little attention because of assumptions that they carry minimal risk for long-term morbidities. The purpose of this study was to compare prekindergarten and kindergarten outcomes among healthy late preterm infants, 34 0/7 to 36 6/7 weeks' gestation at birth, and healthy term infants, 37 0/7 to 41 6/7 weeks' gestation at birth. METHODS. The study sample consisted of singleton infants who were born in Florida between January 1, 1996, and August 31, 1997, with a gestational age between 34 and 41 weeks (N = 161 804) with a length of stay ≤72 hours. Seven early school-age outcomes were analyzed. Outcomes were adjusted for 15 potential confounding maternal and infant variables. Unadjusted and adjusted relative risk with 95% confidence interval was estimated for each outcome by using Poisson regression modeling. RESULTS. Risk for developmental delay or disability was 36% higher among late preterm infants compared with term infants. Risk for suspension in kindergarten was 19% higher for late preterm infants. The remaining 4 outcomes, disability in prekindergarten at 3 and 4 years of age, exceptional student education, and retention in kindergarten, all carried a 10% to 13% increased risk among late preterm infants. The assessment ""not ready to start school"" was borderline significant. CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that healthy late preterm infants compared with healthy term infants face a greater risk for developmental delay and school-related problems up through the first 5 years of life.

313,Behavioral Assessment of Feeding Problems of Individuals With Severe Disabilities,"As many as 80% of the individuals with severe or profound mental retardation exhibit feeding problems. Although behavioral interventions have been used to treat these problems, no assessment procedure for determining a functional relationship between a person's acceptance of food and the type and texture of that food has been reported. The purpose of this study was to test a behavioral assessment procedure for a feeding problem of limited intake. Five individuals with severe or profound mental retardation were fed 10 to 12 types of foods with one or more textures. Behavioral categories of acceptance, rejection, expulsion, and other negative behavior were recorded. Results indicated that each subject fit into one of four categories of feeding problems: (a) total refusal, (b) type selectivity, (c) texture selectivity, or (d) type and texture selectivity. Thus, although all 5 subjects exhibited limited intake, the food characteristics correlated with the problem were different for each individual. Results suggest that treatments for limited intake may be based on assessments that show the association of food type or texture to a person's rejection or expulsion of food.",,"Munk, Dennis D.; Repp, Alan C.",1994,10.1901/jaba.1994.27-241,0,299
314,Effects of budesonide inhalation suspension compared with cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution on health status and caregiver quality of life in childhood asthma.,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of 2 nebulizable controller asthma medications on caregiver and pediatric quality of life. METHODS: In this 52-week, randomized trial, children aged 2 to 6 years with mild to moderate persistent asthma received budesonide inhalation suspension 0.5 mg (total daily dose) once or twice daily (n = 168) or cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution 20 mg 4 times daily (n = 167) for 8 weeks, with dosage adjustment thereafter at the investigators' discretion. The Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ), Compliance/Caregiver Satisfaction Questionnaire (CCSQ), Modified Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF50), and Functional Status-II(R) (FS-II[R]) Questionnaire were administered at baseline and weeks 8, 28, and 52. Global assessments of ease of asthma management and child health status were obtained from caregivers and physicians at the end of the study. RESULTS: Improvements from baseline in domain-specific (activities and emotional function) and total PACQLQ scores were greater at each time point (weeks 8, 28, and 52) for caregivers of patients treated with budesonide compared with caregivers of patients receiving cromolyn sodium. Only the budesonide group met the criterion for a clinically important improvement (>or=0.5 unit change) in all PACQLQ domains by week 8, which was maintained at weeks 28 and 52. Moreover, improvements surpassed the criterion for moderate clinical importance (1.0 unit change) in all PACQLQ domains for the budesonide group, but this level of improvement was only achieved in the activities domain (at week 28) for the cromolyn sodium group. Based on the CCSQ, budesonide resulted in greater caregiver satisfaction, treatment convenience, ease of use, and compliance compared with cromolyn sodium. Thus, 90.7% of caregivers in the budesonide group were ""completely or very satisfied"" compared with 53.4% in the cromolyn sodium group. Over half (54.6%) of caregivers in the budesonide group rated budesonide ""highly or very convenient"" compared with 23% for cromolyn sodium; 77% rated budesonide ""extremely or very easy"" to use compared with 47% for cromolyn. Adherence with daily medication regimens was reported for 76% of children in the budesonide group compared with 57% in the cromolyn sodium group. Child health status, as indicated by mean FS-II(R) scores, showed improvements from baseline in both groups at weeks 8, 28, and 52. There was a trend for these improvements to be superior in the budesonide group. Additionally, budesonide was superior to cromolyn sodium in caregiver and physician global assessments. At the end of the study, 76% of caregivers of children receiving budesonide reported asthma management to be ""a great deal easier"" compared with the start of the study, and 74% rated the overall health status of their child as ""much better now than 1 year ago."" In contrast, only 29% and 37% of caregivers whose children received cromolyn sodium provided these respective ratings. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide inhalation suspension improved the quality of life for caregivers of children with asthma. Caregivers of children treated with budesonide had significantly fewer limitations in daily activities and emotional functioning compared with caregivers of children treated with cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution. The improvements in caregiver quality of life occurred earlier with budesonide compared with cromolyn sodium. Only caregivers in the budesonide group had a clinically important mean change from baseline in all PACQLQ domains by week 8. These benefits were maintained at week 52. Children treated with budesonide inhalation suspension and cromolyn sodium experienced improvements in health status, assessed using the FS-II(R). The greatest differences between treatments were seen in the disease-specific portion of the FS-II(R), which relates impairments in functional status to the child's illness. Caregiver and physician global assessment indicated significantly better overall child health after 1 year of treatment with budesonide, supporting an improvement in health status. Clinical trials in children 4 to 16 years of age with asthma have demonstrated greater effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids versus cromolyn sodium on several clinical measures of efficacy. Measures of asthma control in this study, reported in detail elsewhere [Leflein et al. Pediatrics 2002;109:866-872], also have shown greater improvements with budesonide therapy. Treatment with budesonide inhalation suspension resulted in a significantly lower mean rate of asthma exacerbations, significantly longer times to first asthma exacerbation, significantly longer times to first additional use of chronic asthma therapy, and significant improvements in asthma symptom scores and breakthrough medication use compared with cromolyn sodium therapy. Additionally, children receiving budesonide inhalation suspension experienced more symptom-free days and episode-free days compared with children receiving cromolyn sodium. Safety profiles were similar between the 2 treatment groups. Budesonide inhalation suspension was associated with significantly greater caregiver satisfaction, convenience, ease of use, and compliance compared with cromolyn sodium nebulizer solution. This greater caregiver satisfaction and quality of life may be related to the greater asthma control achieved in children treated with budesonide therapy compared with cromolyn sodium. In addition, the convenience of once- or twice-daily dosing with budesonide inhalation suspension, compared with 3- or 4-times-daily dosing of cromolyn sodium, may decrease caregiver burden and enhance the willingness of caregivers to adhere to treatment regimens prescribed for their young children with asthma. This effect on caregiver adherence could further improve treatment effectiveness. This is the first clinical trial comparing the effects of a nebulized corticosteroid with that of an alternative nebulized therapy on quality of life in young children with asthma and their families. Compared with nebulized cromolyn sodium, budesonide inhalation suspension not only provides better overall child health status and asthma management, but greater caregiver quality of life and greater caregiver satisfaction, convenience, ease of use, and compliance.",,"Murphy, Kevin R.; Fitzpatrick, Sherahe; Cruz-Rivera, Mario; Miller, Christopher J.; Parasuraman, Bhash",2003,10.1542/peds.112.3.e212,0,300
315,Positive behavioral interventions and supports in New Hampshire: Effects of large-scale implementation of schoolwide positive behavior support on student discipline and academic achievement,"This evaluation report presents outcomes for the first cohort of 28 early childhood education programs and K-12 schools involved in implementing schoolwide positive behavior support as part of a statewide systems change initiative that began in New Hampshire in 2002. Results indicate that the overwhelming majority of schools were able to implement schoolwide positive behavioral interventions and supports with fidelity within 2 years and to sustain implementation over the course of the following year. Implementation resulted in a reduction of 6,010 office discipline referrals and 1,032 suspensions, with middle and high schools experiencing the most benefit. These reductions helped recover 864 days of teaching, 1,701 days of learning, and 571 days of leadership. Implementation was associated with academic gains in math for the vast majority of schools who implemented with fidelity. Improvements in reading/language arts were less pervasive. Recommendations for policy, practice, and research are discussed. © 2008 Hammill Institute on Disabilities.",Behavior problems; Behavior support; Discipline,"Muscott, Howard S.; Mann, Eric L.; LeBrun, Marcel R.",2008,10.1177/1098300708316258,1,301
316,The use of Response to Intervention Practices for Behavior: An Examination of the Validity of a Screening Instrument,"Behavioral difficulties of school-aged students are typically dealt with in a reactive, rather than preventative manner. This article examines a proactive approach, consistent with the Response-to-Intervention model, using a screening measure designed to identify students at risk for behavior difficulties and targeting these students for early intervention. Participants in this study were 22,056 kindergarten through 8th grade students in the Minneapolis Public Schools. Teachers completed a 12-item behavior screener for each student in the fall. The scores on this measure were significantly correlated with suspensions, achievement scores and attendance data over the course of the school year. Potential implications for behavioral planning and interventions are discussed.

317,Research to practice: understanding the role of implicit bias in early childhood disciplinary practices,"Racial inequity has long been an issue in the educational system. In recent years, researchers and policy makers have begun to recognize the role of implicit bias in the disproportionate number of African American children who are suspended or expelled from school. Particular attention is being given to the use of exclusionary practices in early childhood settings. This article defines implicit bias, its relationship to exclusionary practices in early education programs, and offers specific recommendations for teachers, practitioners, administrators, and policy makers as they attempt to reduce the effect of implicit bias on suspension and expulsion policies within states, districts, and schools.",,"Neitzel, Jennifer",2018,10.1080/10901027.2018.1463322,1,303
318,New developments in intrauterine device use: focus on the US,"Many more women in the US today rely upon intrauterine devices (IUDs) than in the past. This increased utilization may have substantially contributed to the decline in the percentage of unintended pregnancies in the US. Evidence-based practices have increased the number of women who are medically eligible for IUDs and have enabled more rapid access to the methods. Many women enjoy freedom to use IUDs without cost, but for many the impact of the Affordable Care Act has yet to be realized. Currently, there are three hormonal IUDs and one copper IUD available in the US. Each IUD is extremely effective, convenient, and safe. The newer IUDs have been tested in populations not usually included in clinical trials and provide reassuring answers to older concerns about IUD use in these women, including information about expulsion, infection, and discontinuation. On the other hand, larger surveillance studies have provided new estimates about the risks of complications such as perforation, especially in postpartum and breastfeeding women. This article summarizes significant features of each IUD and provides a summary of the differences to aid clinicians in the US and other countries in advising women about IUD choices.",,"Nelson, Anita; Massoudi, MPH, Natasha",2016,10.2147/oajc.s85755,0,304
319,Factors influencing young children's ability to detect logical inconsistencies in oral communications,"Factors influencing the ability of kindergarten and first grade children to detect inconsistencies in communications were investigated in two experiments. The first experiment revealed that detection was better when the inconsistency occurred between contiguous rather than interspersed statements but that performance was not influenced by the particular source of the story (an adult versus a puppet). The second experiment manipulated set (whether or not children were explicitly told that some passages would not make sense), passage length (short versus long) and passage content (animal versus non-animal). Main effects were obtained for each variable. The results suggest that children as young as five years of age can detect inconsistencies provided the communications presented to them do not exceed their processing capacities or concern topics which prompt a suspension of these capacities. © 1985, SAGE Publications.

320,How Parental Involvement Affects Childhood Behavioral Outcomes,"National Educational and Longitudinal Study 1988 (NELS88) data were used to examine the impact of parental involvement measures on the behavioral outcomes of high-school students. Parents’ general sense of involvement with the community, as well as non-school child-helping groups, were used as instruments for whether these parents were educationally involved with their child. The instrumental variables strategy helped quantify the true effect of parental involvement on own-child behavioral outcomes. The results showed that parental involvement led to better child behavioral outcomes at the high school level, and that this effect was strengthened in the instrumental variables results.",Arrest; Childhood behavior; Parental involvement; Suspension,"Neymotin, Florence",2014,10.1007/s10834-013-9383-y,0,306
321,Medical treatment of missed abortion using misoprostol,"Objective: To compare the efficacy of two routes of misoprostol administration (oral and vaginal) for treatment of missed abortion. Methods: Two hundred women with confirmed missed abortion received 800 mcg misoprostol either orally or vaginally. All women returned for follow-up care 2 days later. If the pregnancy was not completely evacuated at this time, women could wait an additional 5 days or undergo immediate surgical completion. Efficacy was defined as the percent of women discharged from the study without need for surgical intervention. Results: Efficacy was high in both groups and not statistically different (oral=89.0%, vaginal=92.9%). While the groups did not differ in terms of the completion rate by day 2 (oral=41.6%, vaginal=52.7%), the mean time to expulsion was longer (21.04 h) in the oral group than the vaginal group (13.47 h), p=0.041. Women in both groups were highly satisfied with the method. Conclusions: Medical management of missed abortion with either oral or vaginal misoprostol is highly effective and highly acceptable. © 2004 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

322,Gemfibrozil has antidepressant effects in mice: Involvement of the hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor system,"Major depressive disorder has become one of the most serious neuropsychiatric disorders worldwide. However, currently available antidepressants used in clinical practice are ineffective for a substantial proportion of patients and always have side effects. Besides being a lipid-regulating agent, gemfibrozil is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α). We investigated the antidepressant effects of gemfibrozil on C57BL/6J mice using the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), as well as the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression. The changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling cascade in the brain after CUMS and gemfibrozil treatment were further assessed. Pharmacological inhibitors and lentivirus-expressed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were also used to clarify the antidepressant mechanisms of gemfibrozil. Gemfibrozil exhibited significant antidepressant actions in the FST and TST without affecting the locomotor activity of mice. Chronic gemfibrozil administration fully reversed CUMS-induced depressive-like behaviors in the FST, TST and sucrose preference test. Gemfibrozil treatment also restored CUMS-induced inhibition of the hippocampal BDNF signaling pathway. Blocking PPAR-α and BDNF but not the serotonergic system abolished the antidepressant effects of gemfibrozil on mice. Gemfibrozil produced antidepressant effects in mice by promoting the hippocampal BDNF system.",Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; chronic unpredictable mild stress; depression; gemfibrozil,"Ni, Yu Fei; Wang, Hao; Gu, Qiu Yan; Wang, Fei Ying; Wang, Ying Jie; Wang, Jin Liang; Jiang, Bo",2018,10.1177/0269881118762072,0,308
323,An Exploration of Discipline and Suspension Data,"This project serves as a follow-up to an earlier report presented at the annual meeting of the American Educational Research Association - Montreal, Canada in April 1999 (Nichols, Ludwin, & Iadicola, 1999) in which the student discipline and suspension data for a large urban school corporation in the Midwest were explored. In the earlier project, flawed data collection procedures by the school corporation made analysis of the data tentative and problematic. As a result, new data collection procedures were implemented the following year. This project explores this ""following year"" data and expands the analysis to include data from six high schools, 11 middle schools, and 35 elementary schools. Analysis of the student discipline data is presented with a discussion centering on the overrepresentation of minority and low-income students within the data. In addition, this project includes a discipline consequence and zone analysis of behavioral occurrences.

324,Use of clinical simulation centers in health professions schools for patient-centered research,"INTRODUCTION:: Professional practice assessment research performed in clinical simulation centers is a research method that also creates opportunity for multidisciplinary investigator collaboration. METHODS:: Nursing and pharmacy school clinical simulation laboratories at the University of Utah were used to conduct time-and-motion (TM) studies of medication dispensing and administration. Time data were then used to determine personnel and supply costs associated with different medication dosage forms and delivery methods. A case study from a completed research project describes the use of TM and activity-based costing analyses to assess medication preparation and administration time and cost differences related to three proton pump inhibitor dosage forms. Standardized doses were prepared by pharmacists or technicians and subsequently administered by nurses to a mannequin in the simulation center by seven different administration scenarios. Simulation scenarios were developed in a manner that held the independent variables constant, so that time and cost differences between dosage forms and administrations methods could be quantified. RESULTS:: A detailed example of one approach to use of simulation centers for TM studies and activity-based costing analyses is provided. The advantages of isolating processes of interest from the day-to-day complexity of patient care are shown. Results illustrate how simulations based on professional school simulation centers may be used to assess health care processes at the microlevel with potential for projection to the macrolevel. CONCLUSIONS:: Studies based on health professional schools simulation centers may offer a novel method of evaluating health care processes at the microlevel.

Methods: Four kinds of commercially available general blister-packed daily disposable contact lenses (DD CLs) as controls and a novel Magic 1-day Menicon Flat Pack as a test lens were used for this in vitro study. Lenses were removed from their packages using fingers coated with fluorescein 3 to 5 μm beads or an approximately 7×10 to 2×10 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL Staphylococcus aureus suspension. The transfer of fluorescein beads to the surface of the lenses was then observed by fluorescence microscopy. Microbial contamination on the lenses was observed by light microscopy after a 2-day incubation period; and, the number of colonies isolated from the contaminated lenses was determined after 4 days of incubation. Results: The number of fluorescein beads on the Magic lens was significantly less (p<0.05) than that of the general blister-packed control lenses. Adherence of microbial colonies was observed on both inner and outer surfaces of general blister-packed lenses, whereas no colony formation was found on the inner surface of the Magic lens, and the lowest bacterial adherence was observed for the Magic lens. Conclusions: The data demonstrated that placement of the Magic DD lens onto the eye is accompanied by diminished microbial contamination compared with general blister-packed DD CLs. Eye care professionals; however, should instruct patients to comply with intended use of DD CLs to prevent CL-associated microbial keratitis. In all cases, hand washing is mandated prelens insertion. © 2013 Contact Lens Association of Ophthalmologists.",Blister pack; Daily disposable contact lens; Flat pack technology; Microbial adherence,"Nomachi, Miya; Sakanishi, Kotaro; Ichijima, Hideji; Dwight Cavanagh, H.",2013,,0,311
326,The School-To-Prison Pipeline: An Examination of the Association Between Suspension and Justice System Involvement,"The purpose of this study is to contribute to understanding the school-to-prison pipeline by examining the extent to which low school commitment and deviant peer association mediate the relationship between suspension by age 12 and justice system involvement by age 18. The analysis was performed in two steps using structural equation modeling and data from the LONGSCAN study (N = 837). Results of the full model indicate that suspension by the age of 12 is associated with justice system involvement directly and indirectly. Directly, youth who are suspended by age 12 are more likely to report justice system involvement at age 18; indirectly, these youth are more likely to associate with deviant peers in adolescence, increasing their odds of justice system involvement.",juvenile delinquency; school discipline; school suspension; school-to-prison pipeline; structural equation model,"Novak, Abigail",2019,10.1177/0093854819846917,1,312
327,Adoption of rotavirus vaccine by U.S. physicians: Progress and challenges,"Background: Pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5) was recommended for routine use in 2006 followed by monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1) in 2008. Purpose: To describe, among a U.S. sample of pediatricians (n=289 respondents) and family medicine physicians (n=243 respondents), (1) current practices regarding rotavirus vaccine (RV) and barriers to use with comparison to a 2007 survey and (2) knowledge of recent safety concerns regarding RV1 and their impact on its use. Methods: A mail and Internet survey was conducted with the physicians, from November 2010 to January 2011; analyses were conducted March-September 2011. Results: Response rates were 70% (289/410) for pediatricians and 61% (243/401) for family medicine physicians; routine administration of RV was reported by 95% of pediatricians and 65% of family medicine physicians (2007: 85% and 45%). Almost all barriers to use of RV had decreased compared to 2007. For pediatricians and family medicine physicians, respectively, 94% and 70% were aware of the temporary suspension of RV1 due to presence of porcine circovirus; 49% and 45%, respectively, were aware of the addition to RV1 labeling regarding a possible increased risk of intussusception. Among physicians aware of the safety issues, <5% reported stopping giving RV as a result. After reading information about porcine circovirus, 35% of pediatricians and 59% of family medicine physicians reported it had increased their own concerns about the safety of RV; and 31% and 60%, respectively, reported this regarding intussusception. Conclusions: The acceptance of RV has increased, and barriers to use have decreased. Among physicians, recent safety questions about RV1 have not affected use of RV, although they have raised safety concerns.",,"O'Leary, Sean T.; Parashar, Umesh D.; Crane, Lori A.; Allison, Mandy A.; Stokley, Shannon; Beaty, Brenda L.; Brtnikova, Michaela; Hurley, Laura P.; Kempe, Allison",2013,10.1016/j.amepre.2012.10.001,0,313

330,Long-term effects of nurse home visitation on children's criminal and antisocial behavior: 15-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial,"Context. - A program of home visitation by nurses has been shown to affect the rates of maternal welfare dependence, criminality, problems due to use of substances, and child abuse and neglect. However, the long-term effects of this program on children's antisocial behavior have not been examined. Objective. - To examine the long-term effects of a program of prenatal and early childhood home visitation by nurses on children's antisocial behavior. Design. - Fifteen-year follow-up of a randomized trial. Interviews were conducted with the adolescents and their biological mothers or custodial parents. Setting. - Semirural community in New York. Participants. - Between April 1978 and September 1980, 500 consecutive pregnant women with no previous live births were recruited, and 400 were enrolled. A total of 315 adolescent offspring participated in a follow-up study when they were 15 years old; 280 (89%) were born to white mothers, 195 (62%) to unmarried mothers, 151 (48%) to mothers younger than 19 years, and 186 (59%) to mothers from households of low socioeconomic status at the time of registration during pregnancy. Intervention. - Families in the groups that received home visits had an average of 9 (range, 0-16) home visits during pregnancy and 23 (range, 0-59) home visits from birth through the child's second birthday. The control groups received standard prenatal and well- child care in a clinic. Main Outcome Measures. - Children's self-reports of running away, arrests, convictions, being sentenced to youth corrections, initiation of sexual intercourse, number of sex partners, and use of illegal substances; school records of suspensions; teachers' reports of children's disruptive behavior in school; and parents' reports of the children's arrests and behavioral problems related to the children's use of alcohol and other drugs. Results. - Adolescents born to women who received nurse visits during pregnancy and postnatally and who were unmarried and from households of low socioeconomic status (risk factors for antisocial behavior), in contrast with those in the comparison groups, reported fewer instances (incidence) of running away (0.24 vs 0.60; P = .003), fewer arrests (0.20 vs 0.45; P = .03), fewer convictions and violations of probation (0.09 vs 0.47; P<.001), fewer lifetime sex partners (0.92 vs 2.48; P= .003), fewer cigarettes smoked per day (1.50 vs 2.50; P = .10), and fewer days having consumed alcohol in the last 6 months (1.09 vs 2.49; P = .03). Parents of nurse-visited children reported that their children had fewer behavioral problems related to use of alcohol and other drugs (0.15 vs 0.34; P = .08). There were no program effects on other behavioral problems. Conclusions. - This program of prenatal and early childhood home visitation by nurses can reduce reported serious antisocial behavior and emergent use of substances on the part of adolescents born into high-risk families.",,"Olds, David; Henderson, Charles R.; Cole, Robert; Eckenrode, John; Kitzman, Harriet; Luckey, Dennis; Pettitt, Lisa; Sidora, Kimberly; Morris, Pamela; Powers, Jane",1998,10.1001/jama.280.14.1238,0,315
331,Neurodevelopmental delay in the Cln3Δex7/8 mouse model for Batten disease,"Juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL), also known as Batten disease, is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative disorder. The major clinical features of this disease are vision loss, seizures and progressive cognitive and motor decline starting in childhood. Mutations in CLN3 are known to cause the disease, allowing the generation of mouse models that are powerful tools for JNCL research. In this study, we applied behavioural phenotyping protocols to test for early behavioural alterations in Cln3Δex7/8 knock-in mice, a genetic model that harbours the most common disease-causing CLN3 mutation. We found delayed acquisition of developmental milestones, including negative geotaxis, grasping, wire suspension time and postural reflex in both homozygous and heterozygous Cln3Δex7/8 preweaning pups. To further investigate the consequences of this neurodevelopmental delay, we studied the behaviour of juvenile mice and found that homozygous and heterozygous Cln3Δex7/8 knock-in mice also exhibit deficits in exploratory activity. Moreover, when analysing motor behaviour, we observed severe motor deficits in Cln3Δex7/8 homozygous mice, but only a mild impairment in motor co-ordination and ambulatory gait in Cln3 Δex7/8 heterozygous animals. This study reveals previously overlooked behaviour deficits in neonate and young adult Cln3 Δex7/8 mice indicating neurodevelopmental delay as a putative novel component of JNCL. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society.",Batten; CLN3; Disease models; Genetics; Mouse behaviour; Neurodevelopment; Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis,"Osório, N.

332,Early Childhood Behavior Problems and the Gender Gap in Educational Attainment in the United States,"Why do men in the United States today complete less schooling than women? One reason may be gender differences in early self-regulation and prosocial behaviors. Scholars have found that boys’ early behavioral disadvantage predicts their lower average academic achievement during elementary school. In this study, I examine longer-term effects: Do these early behavioral differences predict boys’ lower rates of high school graduation, college enrollment and graduation, and fewer years of schooling completed in adulthood? If so, through what pathways are they linked? I leverage a nationally representative sample of children born in the 1980s to women in their early to mid-20s and followed into adulthood. I use decomposition and path analytic tools to show that boys’ higher average levels of behavior problems at age 4 to 5 years help explain the current gender gap in schooling by age 26 to 29, controlling for other observed early childhood factors. In addition, I find that early behavior problems predict outcomes more for boys than for girls. Early behavior problems matter for adult educational attainment because they tend to predict later behavior problems and lower achievement.",behavioral skills/behavior problems; educational attainment; gender; inequality; life course,"Owens, Jayanti",2016,10.1177/0038040716650926,1,317
334,Supporting Students in Foster Care,"Students living in foster care are at risk for experiencing many challenges in school, spanning domains of social–emotional, behavioral, and academic functioning. They are twice as likely to be absent from school and to have received and out-of-school suspension and up to three and a half times more likely to receive special education services. Therefore, it is important for schools to recognize and respond to the unique needs of students in foster care to provide the necessary resources for school success. When working with students in foster care, school psychologists should be equipped to support the success of these students by determining what the needs of students in foster care are, and how to meet identified needs. The current paper will discuss the education-related vulnerabilities and presenting problems for children in foster care and outline social–emotional, behavioral, and academic supports that school psychologists can offer.",,"Palmieri, Lauren E.; La Salle, Tamika P.",2017,10.1002/pits.21990,1,318
336,A Home and School Support Project for Children Excluded from Primary and First Year Secondary School,"In the last 10 years the problem of exclusion has reached a crisis point. Research suggests that exclusion is a complex phenomenon that needs involvement from all the involved services such as Health, Education and Social Services. One hundred and twenty-four pupils, aged 4–12 years who, through school and social exclusion, were at risk of developing more serious mental health difficulties, were randomly allocated to standard care ( n = 62) or standard care plus the new intervention ( n = 62). There were no significant differences in the primary outcomes between the two groups at either of the outcome assessments. However, the intervention group with non-compliance cases removed from the analysis did significantly better ( p < . 014, 95%CI −12.8 to −1.4). The Home and School Support project managed to reduce the number of excluded days and the appearance of mental health symptoms for pupils who engaged fully with the intervention. The project also highlights the importance of multi-agency involvement at a very early stage.

337,"The relationships between after-school programs, academic outcomes, and behavioral developmental outcomes of Latino children from immigrant families: Findings from the 2005 national household education surveys program","After-school programs function especially well in improving academic and behavioral outcomes for disadvantaged children in general. However, little is known about the effectiveness of after-school programs in improving outcomes among Latino children in particular. Latino children from immigrant families are disadvantaged and vulnerable due to limited English skills and fewer educational resources. We hypothesized that Latino children of immigrant families in after-school programs would have stronger academic performance and fewer behavioral problems than their counterparts who were not in after-school programs. Using the 2005 National Household Education Surveys Program's After-School Programs and Activities survey, we examined whether children in community- or school-based after-school programs (. n=. 192) presented differences in academic development (i.e., higher grades and fewer schoolwork problems) and behavioral development (i.e., fewer behavioral problems, in-school and out-of-school suspensions) than children who were not enrolled in after-school programs (. n=. 720). We found that there were no significant differences in academic and behavioral domains between Latino children in after-school programs compared to students not in after-school programs. Findings from this study provide an opportunity to reflect on whether typical after-school programs are appropriate for Latino children from immigrant families. These findings also highlight the need to integrate culturally valid components into the program for areas where a large number of immigrant Latino families reside.",Child development; After-school programs; Immigrant families; Latino children; Quality of after-school programs,"Park, Hyejoon; Lin, Ching Hsuan; Liu, Chennan; Tabb, Karen M.",2015,10.1016/j.childyouth.2015.03.019,1,320
338,The impact of after-school childcare arrangements on the developmental outcomes of low-income children,"Even though after-school programs (hereafter ASPs) and other types of childcare arrangements have long been implemented, childcare for school-aged children remains a patchwork made up of ASPs, relative care, parental care, and self-care, also with many families opting to use some combination of these types of care. Few studies, however, have examined the impact of various childcare arrangements for school-aged children aside from those focused substantially on ASPs. This study aims to examine how five different after-school childcare arrangements, ASPs, relative care, parental care, self-care, and combinations of care, are related to the academic and behavioral outcomes among low-income, school-aged children. The present study utilized data from the National Household Education Survey Programs: after-school programs and Activities (2005) (NHES: ASPA). Multivariate logistic regressions were conducted using 717 low-income households with children who utilized one of five childcare arrangements. Children's academic performance—academic scores and whether having schoolwork problems or not—and their behavioral outcomes that included whether having behavioral problems or not and whether having experience of suspension, detention, or expulsion, were examined. Findings from the study indicate that, compared to children in ASPs, those in relative care and parental care had better academic performance (fewer schoolwork problems). Parental care was also positively associated with children's behavioral outcomes (fewer behavioral problems). The study demonstrates that relative and parental care have a more positive association with children's developmental outcomes, compared to ASPs. Based on the study findings, practice and policy implications are discussed for low-income children's development. Several methodologies are also suggested for future research.",After-school programs; Child developmental outcomes; Low-income children; Parental care; Relative care,"Park, Hyejoon; Zhan, Min",2017,10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.12.023,1,321
339,‘.he was excluded for the kind of behaviour that we thought he needed support with…’ A qualitative analysis of the experiences and perspectives of parents whose children have been excluded from school,"Exclusion from school is associated with adverse outcomes for young people. There is limited research that explores parents’ perspectives, particularly in relation to the exclusion of primary school aged children. The present study used semi-structured interviews with 35 parents of 37 children aged 5–12 years from the Southwest of England. Parents experiences were captured in a conceptual model through three main themes. Exclusion was described as part of a complex journey of difficulties reflected by a continuum of coping. The child’s place on the continuum was determined by an interaction between the child, family, and school with communication a key determinant. The study also highlighted the wider implications of exclusion, including emotional and functional impacts on the child and parent and highlighted the importance of the parents voice in the identification and support of their child’s needs. It also presents many complexities surrounding exclusion from school and limited support parents felt their child was offered.",primary school; qualitative research; school exclusion; parents’ experiences,"Parker, Claire; Paget, Amelia; Ford, Tamsin; Gwernan-Jones, Ruth",2016,10.1080/13632752.2015.1120070,1,322
340,School exclusion in children with psychiatric disorder or impairing psychopathology: a systematic review,"Childhood psychiatric disorders are associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes including poor academic attainment. For some children these difficulties are recognised through school Special Educational Need procedures (SEN) but many others may remain unidentified and/or unsupported. In Britain, government data suggests disproportionate representation of children with a SEN among children permanently excluded from school. This review asks whether school-aged children with impairing psychopathology were more likely to be excluded from school than those without. Databases covering education, social sciences, psychology and medicine were searched, experts were contacted and bibliographies of key papers were hand-searched. Studies were included if the population covered school-aged children, and if validated diagnostic measures had been used to assess psychopathology. Children with impairing psychopathology had greater odds of exclusion compared to the rest of the school-age population: odds ratios range from 1.13 (95% CI: 0.55–2.33) to 45.6 (95% CI: 3.8–21.3).

341,A Multilevel Exploration of the Influence of Teacher Efficacy and Burnout on Response to Student Problem Behavior and School-Based Service Use,"There is an increasing concern about teacher factors, such as burnout or low efficacy, which have been hypothesized to influence student outcomes like achievement or discipline problems. The current study examined how burnout and efficacy relate to student disciplinary actions (e.g., referrals to the principal and suspensions) and referrals for school-based support services (e.g., student support and special education), while adjusting for school-, teacher-, and student-level variables. Data were collected during the fall and spring of a single school year from 491 teachers regarding 9,795 students at 31 elementary schools. Contrary to expectations, having low teacher efficacy in the fall was associated with a reduction in student referrals to the student support team. Also unexpectedly, teachers with high burnout in the fall were less likely to have students who received an out-of-school suspension by the spring. These findings enhance our understanding of the teacher factors that influence student outcomes and may inform the development of screenings and teacher-targeted interventions. © 2010 American Psychological Association.",multilevel modeling; student behavior problems; referrals; teacher burnout; teacher efficacy,"Pas, Elise T.; Bradshaw, Catherine P.; Hershfeldt, Patricia A.; Leaf, Philip J.",2010,10.1037/a0018576,1,324

The current study examined the effects of universal (tier 1) or school-wide PBIS (SW-PBIS) in one state's scale-up of this tier of the framework. Annual propensity score weights were generated to examine the longitudinal effects of SW-PBIS from 2006–07 through 2011–12. School-level archival and administrative data outcomes were examined using panel models with an autoregressive structure. The sample included 1316 elementary, middle, and high schools. Elementary schools trained in SW-PBIS demonstrated statistically significantly lower suspensions during the fourth and fifth study years (i.e., small effect size) and higher reading and math proficiency rates during the first two study years as well as in one and two later years (i.e., small to large effect sizes), respectively. Secondary schools implementing SW-PBIS had statistically significantly lower suspensions and truancy rates during the second study year and higher reading and math proficiency rates during the second and third study years. These findings demonstrate medium effect sizes for all outcomes except suspensions. Given the widespread use of SW-PBIS across nearly 26,000 schools in the U.S., this study has important implications for educational practices and policies.",Dissemination; Positive Behavioral Interventions And Supports (PBIS); Propensity score weighting; State-wide effects,"Pas, Elise T.; Ryoo, Ji Hoon; Musci, Rashelle J.; Bradshaw, Catherine P.",2019,10.1016/j.jsp.2019.03.001,1,325

344,Global strategy for the diagnosis and management of asthma in children 5 years and younger,"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and the leading cause of childhood morbidity from chronic disease as measured by school absences, emergency department visits, and hospitalions1. During the past two decades, many scientific advances have improved our understanding of asthma and our ability to manage and control it effectively. However, in children 5 years and younger, the clinical symptoms of asthma are variable and non-specific. Furthermore, neither airflow limitation nor airway inflammation, the main pathologic hallmarks of the condition, can be assessed routinely in this age group. For this reason, to aid in the diagnosis of asthma in young children, a symptoms-only descriptive approach that includes the definition of various wheezing phenotypes has been recommended2. In 1993, the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was implemented to develop a network of individuals, organizations, and public health officials to disseminate information about the care of patients with asthma while at the same time assuring a mechanism to incorporate the results of scientific investigations into asthma care. Since then, GINA has developed and regularly revised a Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention. Publications based on the Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention have been translated into many different languages to promote international collaboration and dissemination of information. In this report, Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention in Children 5 Years and Younger, an effort has been made to present the special challenges that must be taken into account in managing asthma in children during the first 5 years of life, including difficulties with diagnosis, the efficacy and safety of drugs and drug delivery systems, and the lack of data on new therapies. Approaches to these issues will vary among populations in the world based on socioeconomic conditions, genetic diversity, cultural beliefs, and differences in healthcare access and delivery. Patients in this age group are often managed by pediatricians and general practitioners routinely faced with a wide variety of issues related to childhood diseases.

The program was initially developed and implemented in an elementary school with a high-risk population. Data from teachers, parents, and children indicate high levels of satisfaction with the program. In addition, unobtrusive measures of program impact, reported as reductions in referrals to the principal's office, suspensions, and increases in homework completion rates relative to the year prior to implementation of the program, suggest a preliminary positive impact of the program. A replication is reported for another school district, with teacher evaluations of satisfaction and effectiveness reported, supporting the flexibility and adaptability of the program.

346,The evidence base for mental health consultation in early childhood settings: A research synthesis addressing children's behavioral outcomes,"Research Findings: Early childhood mental health consultation aims to reduce problem behaviors and improve social skills in young children primarily through changes in the classroom environment and teacher practices.Weconducted a systematic review of the literature and identified 14 rigorous studies that reported on child-level outcomes. These studies had at least one of the following characteristics: publication in a peer-reviewed journal, use of a randomized control trial design, or inclusion of a comparison group. Across these studies, there was variation in the approaches to consultation, qualifications of the consultants, and intensity of the services provided. Overall, early childhood mental health consultation services were consistently associated with reductions in teacher-reported externalizing behaviors. Findings related to reductions in internalizing behaviors were mixed. Teacher ratings of prosocial behaviors were improved in the majority of the studies that reported on this domain. Practice or Policy: This research synthesis underscores the importance of documenting the specific approaches to early childhood mental health consultation that are being implemented to allow for replication of effective models. Areas for future research improvement include increasing rigor through studies that contain independent assessments of children's behaviors, isolating key components of effective consultation, and identifying consultant qualifications and characteristics that lead to child behavior changes. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Perry, Deborah F.; Allen, Mary Dallas; Brennan, Eileen M.; Bradley, Jennifer R.",2010,10.1080/10409280903475444,1,329
347,Reducing the risk for preschool expulsion: Mental health consultation for young children with challenging behaviors,"Increasing numbers of young children are being expelled from child care settings because of their problem behavior. Access to mental health consultation is related to lower rates of expulsion, but additional data are needed to document the pathways through which mental health consultation reduces the risk of expulsion. We report on outcomes from a 4-year project designed to reduce the number of children expelled for problem behavior in a large suburban county in Maryland. Two master's-level professionals provided behavioral consultation to child care providers who identified nearly 200 children at imminent risk for expulsion. Child care providers rated children's social skills and problem behaviors at referral and discharge using the Preschool Kindergarten Behavior Scales and the Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment. Statistically significant increases in social skills and reductions in problem behaviors were seen for children who received individualized consultation. More than three-quarters of the children who were at risk for expulsion were able to be maintained in their current child care placement; of those that changed placements, only half (n = 13) were removed involuntarily. These findings provide additional support for mental health consultation as a promising strategy to reduce the risk for expulsion for young children with problem behaviors. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Preschool; Problem behavior; Mental health consultation,"Perry, Deborah F.; Dunne, M.

348,Contextual variation in young children's observed disruptive behavior on the DB-DOS: Implications for early identification,"Background Contextual variation in child disruptive behavior is well documented but remains poorly understood. We first examine how variation in observed disruptive behavior across interactional contexts is associated with maternal reports of contextual variation in oppositional-defiant behavior and functional impairment. Second, we test whether child inhibitory control explains the magnitude of contextual variation in observed disruptive behavior. Methods Participants are 497 young children (mean age = 4 years, 11 months) from a subsample of the MAPS, a sociodemographically diverse pediatric sample, enriched for risk of disruptive behavior. Observed anger modulation and behavioral regulation problems were coded on the Disruptive Behavior Diagnostic Observation Schedule (DB-DOS) during interactions with parent and examiner. Oppositional-defiant behavior, and impairment in relationships, with parents and nonparental adults, were measured with the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA) interview with the mother. Functional impairment in the home and out-and-about was assessed with the Family Life Impairment Scale (FLIS), and expulsion from child care/school was measured with the baseline survey and FLIS. Results Observed disruptive behavior on the DB-DOS Parent Context was associated with oppositional-defiant behavior with parents, and with impairment at home and out-and-about. Observed disruptive behavior with the Examiner was associated with oppositional-defiant behavior with both parents and nonparental adults, impairment in relationships with nonparental adults, and child care/school expulsion. Differences in observed disruptive behavior in the Parent versus Examiner Contexts was related to the differences in maternal reports of oppositional-defiant behavior with parents versus nonparental adults. Children with larger decreases in disruptive behavior from Parent to Examiner Context had better inhibitory control and fewer attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms. Conclusions The DB-DOS showed clinical utility in a community sample for identifying contextual variation that maps onto reported oppositional-defiant behavior and functioning across contexts.

349,Who Is Most at Risk for School Removal? A Multilevel Discrete-Time Survival Analysis of Individual- and Context-Level Influences,"The focus of this study was to prospectively investigate the effect of aggressive behavior and of classroom behavioral context, as measured in the fall of 1st grade, on the timing of 1st school removal across Grades 1-7 in a sample of predominately urban minority youths from Baltimore, Maryland. Using a multilevel discrete-time survival framework, we found that demographic characteristics of the students as well as early individual- and classroom-level of aggression contribute to the onset of school removal. Although early individual aggression was positively associated with the risk of school removal, initially higher levels of classroom aggression corresponded to lower risk of school removal. © 2011 American Psychological Association.",Aggression; Event history; Multilevel; School removal; Suspension,"Petras, Hanno; Masyn, Katherine E.; Buckley, Jacquelyn A.; Ialongo, Nicholas S.; Kellam, Sheppard",2011,10.1037/a0021545,1,332
350,Treatment of respiratory infections due to Streptococcus pneumoniae in an era of rising penicillin resistance,"For the most part, pathogens commonly involved in acute respiratory infections have not changed substantially over the last decade. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the leading cause of these infections. However, penicillin resistance among S. pneumoniae has been rising rapidly with most recent reports indicating resistance rates of 70 % in Hungary, 50 % in Spain, 50 % in France, and 20-30 % in the US. The growing impact of penicillin resistance among pneumococci in antimicrobial prescribing habits cannot be overestimated. High risk pediatric patients for acquiring penicillin resistant pneumococcal infection include : 1) children in day care; 2) children receiving multiple courses of antimicrobials; 3) children receiving prophylactic antimicrobials. Amoxicillin is currently the most frequently prescribed antimicrobial for the treatment of respiratory infections in children. However, the increasing resistance rate among important, virulent pathogens brings this routine into question, although, some authorities contend that amoxicillin and/or penicillin may remain effective in the treatment of relatively penicillin resistant pneumococci. Newer alternative antimicrobial agents are being used with increasing frequency for empiric treatment of acute respiratory bacterial infections in children. Parameters for selecting among the newer alternatives include : 1) in vitro activity against likely pathogens; 2) proven clinical efficacy; 3) low frequency of adverse events; 4) once or twice a day dosing; 5) palatability in oral suspension; and 6) reasonable cost. Against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, three agents have thus far gained the most attention : cefuroxime axetil, cefprozil, and cefpodoxime proxetil. The cost of antibiotic failure must be assessed to include loss of time from work/school for the parent/child for unsuccessful first time therapies. It is essential that local bacterial resistance patterns be monitored in individual communities. Clinical efficacy trials are necessary to assess if alternatives to amoxicillin will show greater efficacy in management of penicillin-resistant pneumococcal respiratory infections in children. © 1994.",Streptococcus pneumoniae; Acute respiratory infection; Penicillin resistance,"Pichichero, M.

Methods: We report the results of a nonrandomized, nonblinded, open-label, dose-escalation trial of ganaxolone in pediatric subjects (5-15 years) suffering from refractory epilepsy. Subjects received an oral suspension of ganaxolone in a 1:1 complex with β-cyclodextrin in a dose escalation (1 mg/kg, b.i.d. to 12 mg/kg t.i.d.) schedule over 16 days. This was followed by a maintenance period for 8 weeks. Subjects that showed significant response were eligible for a compassionate use extension period. Results: Fifteen subjects enrolled, eight completed the trial and three continued in the open-label compassionate-use extension period. All subject exhibited refractory partial or generalized epilepsy. In an intent-to-treat analysis, four (25%) were considered substantial responders (≥50% reduction in seizure frequency), two (13%) were considered moderate responders (between 25 and 50% reduction in seizure frequency) and the remainder were considered nonresponders (<24% reduction). Three subjects entered the extension phase, one remained essentially seizure-free for over 3.5 years of ganaxolone administration. Ganaxolone was tolerated well. A total of 17 adverse events were reported in 10 patients, all were considered mild to moderate in severity. Somnolence was the most frequently (nine) reported adverse event. Conclusions: This pilot study is consistent with other clinical studies indicating that ganaxolone has anticonvulsant activity in humans. The results of this study encourage the further study of ganaxolone as an antiepileptic therapy. © 2007 International League Against Epilepsy.",Allopregnanolone; Anticonvulsant; Infantile spasms; Neurosteroid; West syndrome,"Pieribone, Vincent A.; Tsai, Julia; Soufflet, Christine; Rey, Elisabeth; Shaw, Ken; Giller, Earl; Dulac, Olivier",2007,10.1111/j.1528-1167.2007.01182.x,0,334

However there was evidence of 'missed opportunities' as 26% of the offenders were not convicted until over 18 years-old. Averaging 7.4 offences each, 29% had a conviction for violence, 29% had been to prison and a further 27% are currently on bail for alleged offences. Home Office-based predictions show that 42% are highly likely to re-commit their most serious offence within 2 years. Based upon Audit Commission and Department of Health estimates, these 143 young adults cost a minimum of £4.16 million. However, 10% of excluded adolescents who were also 'ex child care' had a significantly lower crime rate than the others (41% vs. 70%), which suggests that with targeted support, such as under the 1989 Children Act, effective intervention is possible in a significant number of cases.",,"Pritchard, Colin; Cox, Malcolm",1998,10.1006/jado.1998.0182,0,335
353,From childhood trauma to adult well-being through psychosocial assistance of Chilean families,"This study examined whether psychosocial assistance in childhood predicted coping strategies, family atmosphere, learning experiences and mental health in adulthood. Participants were 153 Chileans (14-30 years old) who, as children, had lost a family member through political imprisonment, execution, disappearance, or expulsion from the country. SEM-modeling revealed that early timing and substantial duration of psychosocial assistance in childhood predicted good mental health and positive learning experiences in adulthood via effective coping strategies. In addition, a family atmosphere characterized by high cohesion and a low level of conflict associated with good mental health and positive learning experiences. Both the nature of childhood trauma and the timing and duration of assistance turned out to be crucial for later resourcefulness and well-being. Children who had lost a parent as executed or disappeared were the most task-oriented and conscientious students and enjoyed a harmonious family life.

The intervention was developed with technical assis-tance consultation that emphasized collaboration among students, school personnel, and bus drivers. The primary intervention procedures were identifying appropriate behaviors during transportation (''bus rules''), training bus drivers to deliver positive reinforcement, and rewarding student performance through a weekly school-based lottery. Disruptive bus behaviors, as measured by discipline referrals and suspensions, decreased with inter-vention relative to baseline phases in an ABAB reversal design. These positive results were maintained over the long term, with school personnel assuming responsibility for inter-vention in the absence of ongoing consultation. DESCRIPTORS: school bus transportation, student discipline, behavioral consulta-tion, systems intervention Improving student discipline in public schools remains a critical priority for edu-cators and the general public (Rose & Gal-lup, 1998). Problems such as classroom dis-ruption, peer victimization (e.g., bullying), insubordination, and vandalism interfere with instruction, pose a threat to others, and create an unsafe learning environment. Be-havior analysts have made important contri-butions to school discipline practices (Lu-iselli & Diament, 2002), focusing primarily on strategic interventions with individual students and, at times, on entire classrooms. More recently, there has been an emphasis on systems-based or whole-school applica-tions of behavior support. As described by Sugai and Horner (2002), a whole-school orientation (a) targets all students, (b) em-phasizes measurable outcomes that are val-ued by stakeholders, (c) incorporates re-search-validated procedures, (d) uses data to guide policy decision making, (e) is domi-Requests for reprints should be sent to",,"Putnam, Robert F.; Handler, Marcie W.; Ramirez-Platt, Christina M.; Luiselli, James K.",2003,10.1901/jaba.2003.36-583,0,337
355,Emotional dysregulation of ADHD in childhood predicts poor early-adulthood outcomes: A prospective follow up study,"Backgroud Emotional dysregulation (EDR) is commonly seen in individuals with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). But few are known about the influence of EDR on early-adulthood outcomes. Aims To detect the relationship between emotional dysregulation (EDR) in childhood and the outcomes in early-adulthood of participants with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD). Methods and procedures Han Chinese children who met DSM-IV ADHD criteria were followed up into early adulthood. The subjects were divided into two groups (with or without EDR) according to the emotion control subscale of Behavior Rating Scale of Executive Function in childhood. In the follow-up interview, their clinical outcomes were assessed by the Conner's Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I and II Disorders. Information on after-school tutoring and suspension of schooling was also collected as indices of educational outcomes. Outcomes and results We followed up 68 out of 90 individuals when they reached early adulthood. Data analysis showed that EDR predicted HI symptoms of ADHD both in childhood (OR = 10.28, p < 0.01) and in early-adulthood (OR = 4.07, p = 0.01). And EDR in childhood had trend to predicted adult ODD (X2 = 3.93, p = 0.05). The suspension of schooling was also predicted by EDR (OR = 9.31, p = 0.04). Conclusions and implications This study illustrated that EDR of children with ADHD, independent of co-occurring ODD, predicted poor long-term clinical and educational outcome in early-adulthood.",ADHD; Adult; Emotional dysregulation; Oppositional defiant disorder; Outcomes,"Qian, Ying; Chang, Wei Li; He, Xiaoxiao; Yang, Li; Liu, Lu; Ma, Quangang; Li, Yueling; Sun, Li; Qian, Qiujin; Wang, Yufeng",2016,10.1016/j.ridd.2016.09.022,0,338
356,Polysubstance Use Among Minority Adolescent Males Incarcerated for Serious Offenses,"Background: Adolescent juvenile offenders are at high risk for problems associated with drug use, including polysubstance use (i.e., use of a variety of drugs). The combination of juvenile offending and polysubstance use presents a significant public and child health concern. Objective: This study explored polysubstance use among a sample of youth incarcerated for serious offenses. We examined several risk factors for substance use and delinquency (i.e., early and frequent substance use, prior history of arrests, school expulsion, Black ethnicity), as well as the association between aggression and polysubstance use. Methods: Data were collected via questionnaires from 373 serious male juvenile offenders upon intake into a secure locked facility. Youth were on average 16 years old, and minority youth were overrepresented (28.1 % Black, 53.1 % Latino). Poisson regressions were used to assess the associations between the risk factors, aggression, and polysubstance use. Results: Consistent with the literature, Black youth reported less polysubstance use and later age of drug use onset than White and Latino youth. Findings suggest that Latino juvenile offenders and those with an early and problematic pattern of substance use are at heightened risk for polysubstance use. Aggression was not significantly related to polysubstance use, over and above the risk factors. Conclusions: Given that Latino youth experience low rates of treatment for substance use, the development of culturally-sensitive interventions for these youth is needed. Interventions should also be multifaceted to address the multitude of risk factors associated with polysubstance use among juvenile offenders.",Aggression; Risk factors; Juvenile offenders; Polysubstance use,"Racz, Sarah Jensen; Saha, Shonali; Trent, Maria; Adger, Hoover; Bradshaw, Catherine P.; Goldweber, Asha; Cauffman, Elizabeth",2016,10.1007/s10566-015-9334-x,0,339
357,The influence of early school punishment and therapy/medication on social control experiences during young adulthood,"The use of suspensions and expulsions by American public school administrators has increased dramatically over the past 40 years. Meanwhile, a growing number of childhood misbehaviors have been diagnosed by doctors as medical conditions and are being treated with therapy or medication. As these trends develop at different rates for boys of different racial and ethnic groups, the connection between childhood and adult social control remains untested empirically. By using a prospective panel of 3,274 White, Black, and Hispanic males (15,675 person-years) and multilevel logistic models, I examine whether and how school punishment and/or the use of therapy or medication during childhood contributes to involvement in the criminal justice or mental health systems during young adulthood. The findings suggest that school punishment is associated with greater odds of involvement in the criminal justice system but not the mental health system. The use of therapy and/or medication during childhood is associated with higher odds of involvement in the mental health system but not the criminal justice system. Finally, although the relationship between school punishment and involvement with the criminal justice system is similar for White, Black, and Hispanic men, the relationship between medicalized social control during childhood and young adulthood is stronger for Whites than for non-Whites.",Criminalization; Life course; Medicalization; Race/ethnicity; School punishment,"Ramey, David M.",2016,10.1111/1745-9125.12095,0,340
358,Microdebrider resection of acquired subglottic cysts: Case series and review of the literature,"Objective: Pediatric subglottic cysts (SGC) are a rare but curable cause of respiratory distress. Previous studies have described microsurgical marsupialization and carbon dioxide laser ablation to treat SGC. In this report we describe our experience performing endoscopic resection of SGC with a laryngeal microdebrider. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent endoscopic resection of SGC with a laryngeal microdebrider between January 2004 and October 2008 at a tertiary care children's hospital was performed. Results: Eight patients with one or more SGC were treated with microdebrider resection. All patients presented with stridor or respiratory distress, were born prematurely (mean gestational age 27 weeks), and had been intubated for between 1 and 91 days (mean 33 days). In all cases, suspension laryngoscopy was performed under general anesthesia. The SGC was visualized using a 4.0-mm Hopkins rod telescope and excised using a 2.9-mm diameter laryngeal microdebrider (skimmer blade). No patient experienced significant bleeding following excision. Mean surgical time was 36 min (range 26-59 min). Seven of eight patients (87.5%) were extubated by post-operative day 1. All patients had a follow-up bronchoscopy within 10 weeks. Six of eight patients (75%) had a single treatment, while two patients (25%) required a second resection. One patient had a symptomatic recurrence (12.5%). All eight patients are now free of disease with a mean follow-up of 21 months. No patient developed clinically significant scarring or subglottic stenosis. Conclusions: The laryngeal microdebrider offers a safe and effective way to remove SGC with a low recurrence rate. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

359,Home-based versus office-based biofeedback therapy for constipation with dyssynergic defecation: a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Office-based biofeedback therapy is effective for constipation with dyssynergic defecation, but must be performed by skilled staff, is only available in selected centres, and requires multiple visits. The efficacy of home-based biofeedback therapy is unknown. We compared clinical and subjective outcomes with home-based and office-based approaches. Methods: In this randomised controlled trial, eligible patients were adult outpatients (age 18–80 years) who met the Rome III criteria for functional constipation and who had been referred to a tertiary-care centre after non-response to routine management, and who had dyssynergic defecation. Patients were randomly assigned according to a schedule generated in advance by the study biostatistician, in permuted blocks of four, to receive office-based or home-based biofeedback therapy. Office-based biofeedback comprised therapist-guided pelvic floor training for six sessions over 3 months (visits every 2 weeks). Home-based biofeedback comprised 20 min self-training sessions twice per day, in which a self-inserted probe was used to provide visual feedback via a handheld monitoring device of anal sphincter pressure and push effort. Patients recorded in diaries the time of each defecation attempt, stool consistency, straining effort, feeling of incomplete evacuation, need for digital assistance with stooling, and satisfaction with bowel function, from 1 week before enrolment to the end of follow-up. Treatment responders were defined post hoc as those with normalisation of dyssynergic defecation and an increase in the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements per week by 3 months. Cost outcomes calculated from health-care costs and loss of salary were assessed from hospital billing and medical records and questionnaires. Primary outcome measures were the presence of a dyssynergic pattern during attempted defecation, balloon expulsion time, the number of complete spontaneous bowel movements per week, and satisfaction with bowel function, assessed by intention to treat (non-inferiority) and per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03202771. Findings: Of 300 patients screened we enrolled 100, from Jan 7, 2005, to Jan 31, 2010. 83 patients completed training (38 [76%] of 50 in the home-based biofeedback group and 45 [90%] of 50 in the office-based biofeedback group). 34 (68%) patients in the home-based group and 35 (70%) in the office-based group were classified as responders. All primary outcomes improved significantly from baseline in the two treatment groups (all p<0·0001). Home-based biofeedback therapy was non-inferior to office-based therapy for number of complete spontaneous bowel movements per week, satisfaction with bowel function, and balloon expulsion time in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, and for dyssynergia in the per-protocol analysis. No adverse events were reported. The median cost of home-based biofeedback therapy was significantly lower than that for office-based treatment (US$1081·70, IQR 794·90–1399·30 vs $1942·50, 1621·70–2369·00, p=0·009). Interpretation: Home-based and office-based biofeedback therapy for dyssynergic defecation improved bowel symptoms and physiology with similar efficacy. A home-based programme could substantially broaden the availability and use of this treatment.

360,Impact of Experience Corps® Participation on Children’s Academic Achievement and School Behavior,"This article reports on the impact of the Experience Corps® (EC) Baltimore program, an intergenerational, school-based program aimed at improving academic achievement and reducing disruptive school behavior in urban, elementary school students in Kindergarten through third grade (K-3). Teams of adult volunteers aged 60 and older were placed in public schools, serving 15 h or more per week, to perform meaningful and important roles to improve the educational outcomes of children and the health and well-being of volunteers. Findings indicate no significant impact of the EC program on standardized reading or mathematical achievement test scores among children in grades 1–3 exposed to the program. K-1st grade students in EC schools had fewer principal office referrals compared to K-1st grade students in matched control schools during their second year in the EC program; second graders in EC schools had fewer suspensions and expulsions than second graders in non-EC schools during their first year in the EC program. In general, both boys and girls appeared to benefit from the EC program in school behavior. The results suggest that a volunteer engagement program for older adults can be modestly effective for improving selective aspects of classroom behavior among elementary school students in under-resourced, urban schools, but there were no significant improvements in academic achievement. More work is needed to identify individual- and school-level factors that may help account for these results.",Academic achievement; Childhood education; Early intervention; Older adult volunteers; School behavior,"Rebok, George W.; Parisi, Jeanine M.; Barron, Jeremy S.; Carlson, Michelle C.; Diibor, Ike; Frick, Kevin D.; Fried, Linda P.; Gruenewald, Tara L.; Huang, Jin; McGill, Sylvia; Ramsey, Christine M.; Romani, William A.; Seeman, Teresa E.; Tan, Erwin; Tanner, Elizabeth K.; Xing, Li; Xue, Qian Li",2019,10.1007/s11121-018-0972-8,0,343
361,The influence of general anxiety and childbirth-specific anxiety on birth outcome,"In the present study, we examined a German sample to determine whether anxiety symptoms during pregnancy had an impact on the duration and method of childbirth. Data of N = 88 women recruited at the Heidelberg University Hospital were used in the analyses. Prepartum anxiety symptoms were assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, general anxiety) and the Pregnancy Related Anxiety Questionnaire (PRAQ-R, pregnancy-specific anxiety). Obstetric outcome was taken from birth records and operationalized by two parameters: the total duration of birth (dilation and fetal expulsion) and the incidence of pregnancy or birth-related interventions (ventouse, planned, and unplanned Cesarean section). The data show that childbirth-specific anxiety assessed by the PRAQ-R is an important predictor of total birth duration. In contrast, general anxiety measured by the STAI had no effect. The incidence of birth intervention was explained by parity. Anxiety, however, had no predictive value. In addition to medical factors, childbirth-specific anxiety during pregnancy plays an important role in the process of childbirth. The findings of the present study point to the need of implementing psychological interventions to reduce childbirth-specific anxiety and thereby positively influencing birth outcome. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",Childbirth-specific anxiety; German sample; Obstetric outcome; Prepartum anxiety symptoms,"Reck, C.; Zimmer, K.; Dubber, S.; Zipser, B.; Schlehe, B.; Gawlik, S.",2013,10.1007/s00737-013-0344-0,0,344
362,Could the Use of an Enhanced Recovery Protocol in Laparoscopic Donor Nephrectomy Be an Incentive for Live Kidney Donation?,"INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Gastrointestinal (GI) recovery after major abdominal surgery can be delayed from an ongoing need for narcotic analgesia thereby prolonging hospitalization. Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) is a multimodal perioperative care pathway designed to facilitate early recovery after major surgery by maintaining preoperative body composition and physiological organ function and modifying the stress response induced by surgical exposure. Enhanced recovery programs (ERPs) in colorectal surgery have decreased the duration of postoperative ileus and the hospital stay while showing equivalent morbidity, mortality, and readmission rates in comparison to the traditional standard of care. This study is a pilot trial to evaluate the benefits of ERAS protocols in living kidney donors undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy. METHODS This is a single-center, non-randomized, retrospective analysis comparing the outcomes of the first 40 live kidney donors subjected to laparoscopic nephrectomy under the ERAS protocol to 40 donors operated prior to ERAS with traditional standard of care. Our ERAS protocol includes reduced duration of fasting with preoperative carbohydrate loading, intraoperative fluid restriction to 3 ml/kg/hr, target urine output of 0.5 ml/kg/hr, use of subfascial Exparel injection (bupivacaine liposome suspension), and postoperative narcotic-free pain regimen with acetaminophen, ketorolac, or tramadol. Short-term patient outcomes were compared using Pearsons's Chi-Squared test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. Additionally, a multivariate analysis was conducted to evaluate factors influencing patient length of stay and likelihood of readmission. RESULTS ERAS protocol reduced the postoperative median length of stay decreased from 2.0 to 1.0 days (p=0.001). Overall pain scores were significantly lower in the ERAS group (peak pain score 6.0 vs. 8.00, p< 0.001; morning after surgery pain score 3.0 vs. 7.0, p=0.001; lowest pain score 0.0 vs. 2.0, p=0.016) despite the absence of postoperative narcotics. The average duration of surgery was shorter in the ERAS group (248 vs. 304 minutes, p<0.001). The average amount of intraoperative fluid used was significantly lower in the ERAS group (2500 ml vs. 3525 ml, p<0.001) without affecting the donor renal function. The incidence of delayed graft function was similar in the two groups (p=0.541). A trend toward lower readmission was noted with the ERAS protocol (12.8% vs. 27.5%, p=0.105). GI dysfunction was the most common reason for readmission. CONCLUSION Application of an ERAS protocol in a laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy was associated with reduced length of hospitalization and improved pain scores related likely to intraoperative use of subfascial Exparel and a shorter duration of ileus. Restricted use of intraoperative fluids prevents excessive third spacing and bowel edema, enhancing gut recovery without adversely impacting recipient graft function. This study suggests that ERAS has the potential to enhance the advantages of laparoscopic surgery for live kidney donation through optimizing donor outcomes and perioperative patient satisfaction.",,"Rege, Aparna; Leraas, Harold; Vikraman, Deepak; Ravindra, Kadiyala; Brennan, Todd; Miller, Tim; Thacker, Julie; Sudan, Debra",2016,10.7759/cureus.889,0,345

364,The Relationship between Homelessness and Behavior Problems among Youth in North Texas: a Brief Report,"This study sought to examine the relationship between homelessness and behavior problems among a community-based sample of youth in North Texas. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional, probability sample of households and a targeted sample of homeless families in Dallas, Texas, with children older than 5 years old (N = 5232). Parents were asked to report five behavior problems on behalf of their children including arrest or trouble with police, academic problems, behavior problems at school, suspension, and suicide attempts. Logistic and negative binomial regression procedures were used to examine the relationship between homelessness and behavior problems. Youth exposed to homelessness were 36% (OR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.00–1.85) more likely to exhibit any kind of behavior problems than youth who had never experienced homelessness. Homeless youth had 5.51 times the odds of arrest (95% CI 2.60–11.68), 1.74 times the odds of academic problems (95% CI 1.24–2.43), and more than 3 times the odds of suicide attempts (95% CI 1.46, 7.61) than youth who had never been homeless. Homelessness was associated with higher rates of problem behavior, including arrests, academic problems, and suicide attempts. Because homeless youth are commonly enrolled in school and present at health care clinics and emergency departments, clinics and schools may aid in the identification of homeless youth, as well as referral to care. In this way, clinicians may help reduce the burden of behavioral problems that disproportionately affect homeless youth.",Behavior problems; Children; Homeless; Suicide; Violence,"Reingle Gonzalez, Jennifer M.; Jetelina, Katelyn K.; Roberts, Madeline; Clutter, Michiko Otsuki; Sanders, Corron; Baidhya, Sweety; Tsai, Ray",2018,,0,347
366,Empirically derived subtypes of child academic and behavior problems: Co-occurrence and distal outcomes,"The aim of this study was to identify classes of children at entry into first grade with different patterns of academic and behavior problems. A latent class analysis was conducted with a longitudinal community sample of 678 predominantly low-income African American children. Results identified multiple subclasses of children, including a class with co-occurring academic and behavior problems. Gender differences were found in relation to the number of identified classes and the characteristics of academic and behavior problems for children. Several of the identified classes, particularly the co-occurring academic and behavior problems subclass for both genders, predicted negative long-term outcomes in sixth grade, including academic failure, receipt of special education services, affiliation with deviant peers, suspension from school, and elevated risk for conduct problems. The finding that subclasses of academic and behavior problems predict negative long-term outcomes validates the importance of the identified classes and the need to target interventions for children presenting with the associated class characteristics. Implications for early identification, prevention, and intervention for children at risk for academic failure and disruptive behavior problems are discussed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Academic underachievement; Behavior problems; Latent class analysis,"Reinke, Wendy M.; Herman, Keith C.; Petras, Hanno; Ialongo, Nicholas S.",2008,10.1007/s10802-007-9208-2,0,348
367,Patterns of language impairment and behaviour in boys excluded from school,"Background. High levels of behaviour problems are found in children with language impairments, but less is known about the level and nature of language impairment in children with severe behavioural problems. In particular, previous data suggest that at primary age, receptive impairments are more closely related to behaviour problems, whereas expressive language has a closer link at a later age. Aims. The study assessed expressive and receptive language problems in boys excluded from primary and secondary schools, to investigate the extent of impairment, the pattern of relations between age, receptive and expressive language, and relations with different aspects of behaviour. Sample. Nineteen boys (8-16 years of age) who had been excluded from school and 19 non-excluded controls matched for age and school participated. Method. The sample was given assessments of: receptive language from the British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS), and Wechsler Objective Language Dimensions (WOLD); expressive-language evaluations from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC); auditory working memory evaluations from the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (CELF); verbal reasoning (from the WISC); and non-verbal IQ assessments Raven's matrices. Teachers completed behaviour ratings using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results. Excluded boys were significantly poorer than controls on expressive measures but similar on receptive language and non-verbal IQ. Boys excluded from primary school were poorer than controls on auditory working memory. Expressive problems were linked with high levels of emotional symptoms. Conclusion. Many of the excluded boys had previously unidentified language problems, supporting the need for early recognition and assessment of language in boys with behaviour problems. Expressive problems in particular may be a risk factor. © 2005 The British Psychological Society.",,"Ripley, Kate; Yuill, Nicola",2005,10.1348/000709905X27696,0,349
368,Investing in the early childhood mental health workforce development: Enhancing professionals’ competencies to support emotion and behavior regulation in young children,"This paper delineates a preventive approach to early childhood mental health by preparing the workforce to provide relational, sensitive care to young children ages 0-5. One of the most prevalent issues in early childhood is behavioral challenges and the inability of young children to regulate themselves. This leads to an expulsion rate in early childhood (3-4 times higher than K-12 expulsion rate) and future mental health issues. The Early Childhood Social-Emotional and Behavior Regulation Intervention Specialist (EC-SEBRIS) graduate level certificate program was created to strengthen early care and education providers with the knowledge and practice of how to support emotion and behavior regulation in young children in their groups. Evaluation data provide evidence that early care and education professionals increased in their perception of selfefficacy and in their sensitivity of care and skills to support behavioral health in young children. Results indicated that the children in their care showed less challenging behaviors and increased social competencies.

His suspension from kindergarten was due to kicking and biting his classmates, but he has also become increasingly aggressive at home. His teacher reported that he has always had a high activity level and difficulty shifting attention between tasks, as well as noncompliance with rules and directions. He is noted to have learning challenges and is showing difficulties in the concept of numbers and letter sounds.The practice has followed Thomas since his healthy birth. He has a history of delayed language development, and he received early intervention services from 2 years of age. He spoke his first word at 2 years 6 months. He started a half-day preschool program at 3 years of age. He had difficulty acclimating to preschool, interacting with peers, and was described as ""hyperactive"" by his teachers. His program was modified to decrease his time having to sit in a circle time, and he often required the support of the paraprofessional in the classroom.His parents have always described him as a ""difficult child."" He gets frustrated easily and can tantrum for up to 2 hours multiple times in a week when his immediate needs or requests are not met. He has difficulty falling asleep, has frequent night awakenings, and often has trouble getting back to sleep. His self-help skills are poor, and he has difficulty with activities such as brushing his teeth and dressing. His parents report that he does not seem to remember rules from day to day. He was evaluated at 5 years of age and diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but his response to stimulants has been limited.Thomas is an only child. His parents are college educated and professionally employed. They deny drug use, domestic violence, and guns in the home. They reported that prior to the pregnancy, they enjoyed ""partying"" with friends on the weekends, but Thomas's mother reported that she stopped drinking as soon as she realized she was pregnant.All are wondering whether this child might have a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, although he seems to have no clear facial dysmorphology.

370,"Play, playfulness, and self-efficacy: Parental experiences with children on the autism spectrum","Background. Play serves as an essential medium for parent-child interaction; however, engaging children with ASD through play can be a challenge for parents. Purpose. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore the perspectives of parents with children on the autism spectrum regarding play experiences and self-efficacy during play encounters. Method. Semistructured interviews were administered to 8 parents of children 3–7 years of age with ASD. The analysis was guided by the constant comparison method. Findings. Parental narratives denoted playful experiences reflecting components of Skard and Bundy’s model of playfulness. The facilitation of framing and suspension of reality were generally more challenging than facilitating intrinsic motivation and internal control. Participants associated self-efficacy during play with their perceived ability to interact with their child and with positive emotions experienced during play. Fathers generally derived a greater sense of self-efficacy from play encounters than mothers, and this was explained by differences in fathers’ and mothers’ motivations for playing. Mothers were motivated to play for outcome-oriented reasons (e.g., promote the child’s progress) whereas fathers’ motivations depicted greater emotional emphasis, reflecting a better match between motivation and perceived indicators of efficacy during play. Conclusion. The results suggest that a good match between motivation for playing and perceived indicators of efficacy during play is important for a parental sense of self-efficacy. Occupational therapists should utilize coaching strategies to increase parents’ understanding of play and playfulness and how they can affect a sense of parental self-efficacy.",,"Román-Oyola, Rosa; Figueroa-Feliciano, Verónica; Torres-Martínez, Yoliannie; Torres-Vélez, Jorge; Encarnación-Pizarro, Keyshla; Fragoso-Pagán, Samariz; Torres-Colón, Luis",2018,10.1155/2018/4636780,0,352
371,Physiology of a microgravity environment selected contribution: Effects of spaceflight during pregnancy on labor and birth at 1 G,"The events of parturition (labor, delivery, maternal care, placentophagia, and onset of nursing) were analyzed in female Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) flown on either 11- or 9-day-long spaceflights beginning at the approximate midpoint of their pregnancies. Each space shuttle flight landed on the 20th day of the rats' pregnancies, just 48-72 h before parturition. After spaceflight, dams were continuously monitored and recorded by time-lapse videography throughout the completion of parturition and onset of nursing (days 22 and 23). Analyses of parturition revealed that, compared with ground controls, flight dams displayed twice the number of lordosis contractions, the predominant labor contraction type in rats.

372,The assessment and treatment of long-standing disruptive behavior problems in a 10-year-old boy,"A 10-year-old boy was referred for ongoing behavioral problems. These problems were reported as having occurred at home since preschool years and had become increasingly problematic outside of the home in latter years, resulting in frequent suspensions from school. A range of diagnoses had been made in the years prior to referral, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). The central intervention since age 6 had been pharmacotherapy, with intermittent support at school in the form of school counseling and teachers' aids. However, the situation appeared to only be worsening, and the need for a more integrated, multimodal approach was recognized. In addition to individual therapy for the client and his mother, the intervention also included engagement of the father, collaboration with other educational and professional service providers, and the development of an integrated plan with shared objectives and strategies. The case explores limitations inherent in taking a medical model diagnostic approach to child behavioral problems and highlights the need to utilize an idiographic approach taking a range of individual psychosocial circumstances into account, rather than taking a more nomothetic treatment approach based mainly on diagnostic assessment. © 2011 SAGE Publications.",collaborative multimodal approach; disruptive behavior disorders; idiographic; nomothetic,"Rote, Julian A.; Dunstan, Debra A.",2011,10.1177/1534650111410228,0,354
373,Comprehensive Challenges for the Well Being of Young Children: A Population-based Study of Publicly Monitored Risks in a Large Urban Center,"This population-based study investigated the unique and cumulative relations between risks that are monitored by public surveillance systems and academic and behavioral outcomes for an entire cohort of third graders in a large, urban public school system. Using integrated, administrative records from child welfare, public health, housing, and education for a population of over 10,000 students, this study documented the disproportionate prevalence of early risks that included low birth weight or preterm birth, inadequate prenatal care, teen mother, high lead exposure, low maternal education, child maltreatment, and homelessness. Multiple logistic regression analyses demonstrated that low maternal education (i. e., mothers without a high school degree) had the strongest association with third grade reading and math achievement, attendance, and school suspensions, controlling for child demographics, poverty, and all other risks. Classroom behavior was significantly influenced by familial and social risks (i. e., teen mother, low maternal education, homelessness, and maltreatment), but not biological risks (i. e., preterm or low birth weight and high lead). The cumulative number of risk experiences was significantly related to both academic and behavioral outcomes and was most strongly associated with school attendance problems. Implications of the study for national child welfare and educational policy are discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Birth risk; Child welfare; Cumulative risk; Early childhood; Educational well being; High lead; Homelessness; Maltreatment; Maternal education; Prenatal care; Risk factors; Teen mother,"Rouse, Heather L.; Fantuzzo, John W.; LeBoeuf, Whitney",2011,10.1007/s10566-010-9138-y,0,355
374,Antimicrobial drug suspensions: A blind comparison of taste of fourteen common pediatric drugs,"Children of preschool age most often receive medications in liquid form, and smell and taste are major determinants in achieving compliance. We compared smell, taste and other characteristics of 14 commonly prescribed antimicrobial suspensions in a blind test in 30 adult volunteers to determine whether there was a difference in their acceptability. A significant difference was observed with cephalosporins ranking highest and penicillins ranking lowest. Our findings support anecdotal observations and claims often made by parents that cephalosporin antimicrobial suspensions taste good and are readily accepted by children and that penicillin suspensions have an unpleasant taste and aftertaste and are poorly accepted. Other drugs had intermediate scores.

375,Epidemiology of Depressive Symptoms in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health,"Objective: To describe the range of depressive symptoms reported by adolescents in a nationally representative U.S. sample and to examine factors associated with persistent depressive symptoms. Method: Secondary analysis was done on National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth) data from 13,568 adolescents who completed the initial survey in 1995 and follow-up 1 year later. Main outcomes of Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) scores were analyzed by χ2, comparisons and sample-weighted logistic regression. Results: Over 9% of adolescents reported moderate/severe depressive symptoms at baseline (CES-D ≥ 24). Females, older adolescents, and ethnic minority youths were more likely to report depressive symptoms at baseline. Only 3% of adolescents with low initial CES-D scores (CES-D < 16) developed moderate/severe depressive symptoms at follow-up. Factors associated with persistent depressive symptoms at 1-year follow-up included: female gender, fair/poor general health, school suspension, weaker family relationships, and health care utilization. Other factors, including race and socioeconomics, did not predict persistent depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are common in adolescents and have a course that is difficult to predict. Most adolescents with minimal symptoms of depression maintain their status and appear to be at low risk for depression; however, adolescents with moderate/severe depressive symptoms warrant long-term follow-up and reevaluation.",Adolescence; Depression; Psychiatric status rating scales; Screening,"Rushton, Jerry L.; Forcier, Michelle; Schectman, Robin M.",2002,10.1097/00004583-200202000-00014,0,357
376,Antimicrobial Activity of Home Disinfectants and Natural Products Against Potential Human Pathogens,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of both natural products (vinegar, baking soda) and common commercial disinfectants (Vesphene IIse, TBQ, Clorox, Lysol Disinfectant Spray, Lysol Antibacterial Kitchen Cleaner, Mr. Clean Ultra, ethanol) designed for home or institutional use against potential human pathogens, including selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria. DESIGN: A quantitative suspension test was used to assess the efficacy of selected disinfectants following exposure times of 30 seconds and 5 minutes. Activity was assessed against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella choleraesuis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Selected disinfectants were also tested against poliovirus, vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus species, and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S aureus. RESULTS: The following compounds demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activity (>5.6-8.2 log10reduction) at both expo-sure times: TBQ, Vesphene, Clorox, ethanol, and Lysol Antibacterial Kitchen Cleaner. Mr. Clean eliminated 4 to >6 logs10and Lysol Disinfectant ∼4 logs10of pathogenic microorganisms at both exposure times. Vinegar eliminated <3 logs10of S aureus and E coli, and baking soda <3 logs10of all test pathogens. All tested chemical disinfectants completely inactivated both antibiotic-resistant and -susceptible bacteria at both exposure times. Only two disinfectants, Clorox and Lysol, demonstrated excellent activity (>3 log10reduction) against poliovirus. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of commercial household disinfectants were highly effective against potential bacterial pathogens. The natural products were less effective than commercial household disinfectants. Only Clorox and Lysol disin-fectant were effective against poliovirus.",,"Rutala, William A.; Barbee, Susan L.; Aguiar, Newman C.; Sobsey, Mark D.; Weber, David J.",2000,10.1086/501694,0,358
378,African American males in foster care and the risk of delinquency: The value of social bonds and permanence,"Juvenile delinquency remains a significant problem for child welfare systems throughout the United States. Victims of child abuse and neglect are more likely relative to children in the general population to engage in delinquency (Ryan & Testa, 2005; Widom, 1989). Although the magnitude of this relationship is not fully understood (Zingraff, Leiter, Myers, & Johnsen, 1993), the risk of delinquency is particularly high for African American males, adolescents, and children in substitute care settings. Unfortunately little is known about the factors that connect the experiences of maltreatment and delinquency. This lack of knowledge makes it nearly impossible to decrease the risk of delinquency for children in foster care. To improve the understanding of juvenile delinquency in the child welfare system, the current study tests aspects of social control theory within the context of foster care. We focus specifically on the effects of foster parent foster child attachment, commitment, and permanence. The results indicate that strong levels of attachment decrease the risk of delinquency for youth in foster care. Involvement with religious organizations also decreases the risk of delinquency. In contrast, perceptions of placement instability, placement with relatives, and school suspensions are associated with an increased risk of delinquency.",,"Ryan, Joseph P.; Testa, Mark F.; Zhai, Fuhua",2008,,0,359

381,Outcomes of comprehensive care for children empirically treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in a setting of high HIV prevalence,"Background:Few studies have examined outcomes for children treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), including those receiving concomitant treatment for MDR-TB and HIV co-infection. In Lesotho, where the adult HIV seroprevalence is estimated to be 24%, we sought to measure outcomes and adverse events in a cohort of children treated for MDR-TB using a community-based treatment delivery model.Methods:We reviewed retrospectively the clinical charts of children ≤15 years of age treated for culture-confirmed or suspected MDR-TB between July 2007 and January 2011.Results:Nineteen children, ages two to 15, received treatment. At baseline, 74% of patients were co-infected with HIV, 63% were malnourished, 84% had severe radiographic findings, and 21% had extrapulmonary disease. Five (26%) children had culture-confirmed MDR-TB, ten (53%) did not have culture results available, and four (21%) subsequently had results indicating drug-susceptible TB. All children with HIV co-infection who were not already on antiretroviral therapy (ART) were initiated on ART a median of two weeks after the start of the MDR-TB regimen. Among the 17 patients with final outcomes, 15 (88%) patients were cured or completed treatment, two (12%) patients died, and none defaulted or were lost to follow-up. The majority of patients (95%) experienced adverse events; only two required permanent discontinuation of the offending agent, and only one required suspension of MDR-TB treatment for more than one week.Conclusions:Pediatric MDR-TB and MDR-TB/HIV co-infection can be successfully treated using a combination of social support, close monitoring by community health workers and clinicians, and inpatient care when needed. In this cohort, adverse events were well tolerated and treatment outcomes were comparable to those reported in children with drug-susceptible TB and no HIV infection. © 2012 Satti et al.",,"Satti, Hind; McLaughlin, Megan M.; Omotayo, David B.; Keshavjee, Salmaan; Becerra, Mercedes C.; Mukherjee, Joia S.; Seung, Kwonjune J.",2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0037114,0,361
382,Baby doe redux? The Department of Health and Human Services and the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002: A cautionary note on normative neonatal practice,"The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act (BAIPA), passed by Congress in 2002, has attracted little publicity. Its purposes were, in part, ""to repudiate the flawed notion that a child's entitlement to the protections of the law is dependent on whether that child's mother or others want him or her."" Understood as antiabortion rhetoric, the bill raised little concern among physicians at the time of legislative hearings and passed in both Houses by overwhelming majorities, hardly suggesting contentious legislation. After its signing into law, the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) Steering Committee issued an opinion stating that ""[BAIPA] should not in any way affect the approach that physicians currently follow with respect to the extremely premature infant."" This interpretation of the law, however, may have been short sighted. In April 2005, the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) brought life to the BAIPA, announcing: ""As a matter of law and policy, [DHHS] will investigate all circumstances where individuals and entities are reported to be withholding medical care from an infant born alive in potential violation of federal statutes."" The agency issued instructions to state officials on how the definitional provision within the BAIPA interacts with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA). These interagency memoranda potentially resurrect dormant governmental oversight of newborn-treatment decisions and thus may have influence over normative neonatal practice. Under the BAIPA, the DHHS interprets EMTALA to protect all ""born-alive"" infants; hospitals and physicians violating regulatory requirements face agency-sanctioned monetary penalties or a ""private right of action by any individual harmed as a direct result."" According to its memorandum, the DHHS will investigate allegations of EMTALA violations whenever it finds evidence that a newborn was not provided with at least a medical screening examination under circumstances in which a ""prudent layperson observer"" could conclude from the infant's ""appearance or behavior"" that it was ""suffering from an emergency medical condition."" The memorandum fails to clarify which observers qualify as prudent, what infant appearance or behavior is relevant, or what defines an emergency medical condition. Because these evaluative criteria are not constrained by reference to relevant standards of medical care, the agency arguably substitutes a nonprofessional's presumed sagacious assessment of survivability for reasonable medical judgment. Indeed, under a straightforward reading of the instruction, a family member could conceivably trigger an investigation after observing a relative deliver a 20-week fetus who maintains a heartbeat for an hour before its death. Most physicians would not consider this an emergency medical condition and, rather than perform a screening examination, would provide comfort for the newborn and support for the family. The guideline, however, does not state that professional acumen trumps the layperson's observations in these instances; thus, physicians are left unclear about whether screening examinations are required for all newborns regardless of a priori, reasoned considerations of survivability. In this context, the NRP Steering Committee opinion states that ""at the time of delivery . . . the medical condition and prognosis of the newly born infant should be assessed. At that point decisions about withholding or discontinuing medical treatment that is considered futile may be considered by . . . providers in conjunction with the parents acting in the best interest of their child."" However, most pediatricians skilled in screening and resuscitation are not currently called on to perform this function when the gestational age of a nonviable fetus is reasonably certain before delivery. If under the law screening is now required at any gestational age, professional procedure immediately after previable births may need modification. More worrisome, threatened aggressive investigations of alleged EMTALA violations at the soft edges of viability, where futility remains a matter of debate, jeopardize the normative ethical practice of offering discretionary palliative care. The DHHS sent its other instruction to state child protective services agencies responsible for implementing CAPTA regulations; it reiterates the limited situations in which physicians may withhold medical treatment from infants and reemphasizes the local role of ""individuals within health care facilities"" to notify authorities of suspected infractions. Its real import, however, is insistence on local execution of legal remedies to prevent nontreatment decisions deemed impermissible by the 1984 Baby Doe rules. Because this new directive encourages governmental oversight of treatment decisions involving imperiled newborns, a period of benign regulatory neglect seems to be over. The federal CAPTA rules arguably remove quality-of-life considerations from the decision-making calculus and therefore may conflict with the best-interests paradigm advocated by the American Academy of Pediatrics and NRP. How courts will respond to the DHHS interpretation of EMTALA and CAPTA under the BAIPA remains unclear. Federal courts have yet to authoritatively examine alleged EMTALA violations involving newborn treatment decisions at the limits of viability. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has permitted an EMTALA claim to go to trial where physicians allegedly did not screen or resuscitate a 22-week newborn delivered in an emergency department, and a lower appellate court has relied on CAPTA to hold that parents do not possess the right to choose against resuscitating an extremely premature newborn. The Texas Supreme Court recently granted physicians the paternalistic prerogative to resuscitate imperiled newborns without attention to parental preference under a common law doctrine of ""emergent circumstances."" These judicial decisions undermine the ethical discretion parents are typically afforded in decision-making before and after delivery in these morally complex situations. The DHHS interpretation of the BAIPA may encourage jurisdictional creep of these kinds of pronouncements as the agency seeks to expand legal protections for born-alive infants. The US Supreme Court has stated that ""courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there""; thus, judges interpret law by analyzing ""concrete statutory language, not by reference to abstract notions of generalized legislative intent."" The BAIPA indiscriminately defines ""born alive"" to include an infant ""at any stage of development . . . regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of natural or induced labor, cesarean section, or induced abortion,"" and it makes no reference to standards of care or best interests, nor does it specifically protect a parent's decision-making authority. Under the law's strict logic, an 18-week miscarried fetus with a detectable heart beat after delivery is entitled to the full protections of the law as determined by ""any Act of Congress, or any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies."" Before concluding that the BAIPA would not affect normative neonatal practice, the NRP Steering Committee should have analyzed the act's actual statutory language and avoided relying heavily on imprecise legislative intent. The BAIPA's congressional sponsors did claim that the law ""will not mandate medical treatment where none is currently indicated,"" but such political rhetoric is often not sufficient to render law innocuous years after separation from its legislative history. Besides, nowhere in the House record does the majority explicitly acknowledge that discretion to decide the fate of imperiled newborns invests in parents, in consultation with physicians; indeed, the bill's stated purpose was to repudiate that notion. At best, legislators recognized that physicians disagree about the efficacy of resuscitating at the limits of viability, and therefore the current standard of care permits doctors to deem resuscitation a futile endeavor. However, judges may resist characterizing resuscitation as futile, given its poor analytical fit, and substantial public-policy concerns regarding discrimination against future disabled individuals could easily tip a court to preserve incipient, at least, physiologic life under the BAIPA's all-encompassing definition of born alive.

383,"Evaluation of insulin-like growth factor-1, total thyroxine, feline pancreas-specific lipase and urinary corticoid-to-creatinine ratio in cats with diabetes mellitus in Switzerland and the Netherlands","Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), feline pancreas-specific lipase (fPLI) and total thyroxine (TT4) concentrations and urinary corticoid-to-creatinine ratio (UCCR) as indicators for the prevalence of acromegaly, pancreatitis, hyperthyroidism and hypercortisolism in cats with diabetes mellitus. Methods: Blood and urine samples were collected from diabetic cats treated in primary care clinics in Switzerland and the Netherlands. Standardised questionnaires and physical examination forms provided clinical information from owners and veterinarians. Laboratory testing included serum biochemistry profile analysis and measurement of circulating fructosamine, IGF-1, fPLI, and TT4 concentrations and UCCR. CT of the pituitary gland was performed using a multidetector computed tomography scanner. Results: Blood samples were available from 215 cats and urine samples were collected at home from 117 cats. Age ranged from 2–18 years (median 12 years) and body weight from 2.7–12.3 kg (median 5.5 kg). Sixty-five percent of the cats were castrated male and 35% were female (33% spayed); 82% were domestic shorthair cats. Eighty percent of cats received a porcine insulin zinc suspension, 19.5% insulin glargine and 0.5% a human neutral protamine hagedorn insulin. Thirty-six of 202 (17.8%) cats had IGF-1 concentrations >1000 ng/ml. Serum fPLI, and TT4 concentrations and UCCR were increased in 86/196 (43.9%), 9/201 (4.5%) and 18/117 cats (15.3%), respectively. Prevalence did not differ between countries. Conclusions: Hyperthyroidism is rare, whereas increased fPLI concentration, possibly reflecting pancreatitis, is common in diabetic cats. The high UCCR may reflect activation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis, which also occurs in diabetic humans. The percentage of cats with increased IGF-1 was high but lower than reported in recent studies.",,"Schaefer, Sandra; Kooistra, Hans S.; Riond, Barbara; Suchodolski, Jan S.; Steiner, Jörg M.; Prins, Marrit; Zini, Eric; Reusch, Claudia E.",2017,10.1177/1098612X16664390,0,363

385,Study Monitoring in Emergency Care Trials: Lessons from the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Continuous Chest Compressions Trial,"Objective: Clinical trial investigators often assemble internal study monitoring committees (SMCs) to measure individual or group adherence with trial performance benchmarks. We examined the processes and results of study monitoring in an international trial of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: We studied SMC operations for the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) Continuous Chest Compressions (CCC) trial, which compared continuous with interrupted chest compressions upon survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The SMC defined trial performance benchmarks, which included compliance with the intervention, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) process data availability and timely data completion. Trial investigators received monthly performance reports. We determined rates of trial noncompliance and suspension from the trial. Results: ROC-CCC enrolled a total of 23,711 subjects in the primary analysis population. Across 113 enrolling agencies, the SMC monitored performance for a total 2,367 agency-months. Emergency medical services agencies were on probation for a total of 178 (7.5%) agency-months. Fifty-five agencies were placed on probation at least once, of which 78% improved their performance and were approved for continued participation in the trial. A total of 12 agencies were suspended from trial participation. Data monitoring resulted in high-quality CPR (mean chest compression fraction = 0.80), 87% CPR process availability and timely data completion (75th and 95th percentiles prehospital data = 22 and 57 days; hospital data = 58 and 118 days).

However, FBA also holds significant promise as a procedure to be used proactively with students with behavioral challenges who are educated in part, or wholly, in general education classrooms. Unfortunately, current conceptualizations of FBA as a methodologically rigorous procedure pose significant and possibly insurmountable barriers to proactive implementation in general education settings. The authors analyze these barriers through a targeted review of the literature, an examination of how the characteristics of general education settings promote the use of less demanding FBA methodologies, and a consideration of situations in which certain FBA procedures generally are contraindicated.

Jeff was born with an imperforate anus, and he had several surgical procedures in the first few years of life. He has a colostomy, but it is not clear how well he cares for it independently. Jeff's parents state that there other concern is that to prepare for school each morning or for other activities, they literally remind him of each step. Jeff has been active and disruptive since preschool, but is also described as ""charming."" School work and peer relations improved following a diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the second grade and treatment with a long-acting stimulant medication. An Independent Education Plan (IEP) in second grade included achievement tests that demonstrated above grade level scores. Jeff continued to have problems with written expression, but did quite well in verbal expression. By seventh grade, Jeff complained to his parents that he ""wasn't fun to be around,"" and refused to take medication for ADHD. He increasingly refused to do most of his homework or class work. Grades were approaching failing levels in the eighth grade when he was suspended twice for impulsive behaviors-drawing a picture of a gun pointed at another student, and signing a petition stating that a classmate was gay. After his second suspension, he was sent to a continuation school, where he resisted doing the required work, failed each subject, and socialized with peers. Jeff is failing in ninth grade although his teachers describe him as respectful in the classroom. His parents divorced when Jeff was a preschooler, and they do not agree on how to manage Jeff. Jeff's father has not supported medication for the treatment of ADHD. The parents tried numerous strategies to help Jeff, including improving organizational skills, offering rewards and punishments and counseling; they have participated in parenting classes. The parents acknowledge that Jeff always tries to negotiate with them and they often give in.

Method: A prospective study was conducted in the period from 2006 to 2007 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Novi Sad. Subjects were 50 breech-presenting and 87 occipital-presenting term newborns delivered by elective cesarean section following a regular course of pregnancy, without fetal, newborn, and the pregnant female disease. Outcome measures were popliteal angle; extension of the hip-joint; ventral flexion and dorsal extension in the axis; spontaneous displacement; crawling reflex; righting reaction in vertical and sitting positions; righting reaction in horizontal suspension, the automatic walking investigated on the second and fourth day of life. Results: Except for righting reaction in horizontal suspension, the newborns from breech presentation had a significantly lower score for all investigated parameters of active movements at the first and second examination. There was no difference between occipital and breech-group relative to the ventral flexion and dorsal extension in the axis. The popliteal angle was significantly increased, whereas the extension in the hip joint was significantly decreased in the breech group. Conclusions: Investigations showed a significantly decreased expression of active movements in the breech group, which cannot be explained only by postural deformities. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The impact of varying durations of MA abstinence on depression-like symptoms and on subsequent MA intake was examined in mice genetically prone to binge-level MA consumption. Binge-level MA intake was induced using a multiple-bottle choice procedure in which mice were offered one water drinking tube and three tubes containing increasing concentrations of MA in water, or four water tubes (control group). In two studies, depression-like symptoms were measured using a tail-suspension test and a subsequent forced-swim test, after forced abstinence of 6 and 30 hours from a 28-day course of chronic MA intake. An additional study measured the same depression-like symptoms, as well as MA intake, after prolonged abstinence of 1 and 2 weeks. MA high drinking mice and one of their progenitor strains DBA/2J escalated their MA intake with increasing MA concentration; however, MA high drinking mice consumed almost twice as much MA as DBA/2J mice. Depression-like symptoms were significantly higher early after MA access was withdrawn, compared to levels in drug-naïve controls, with more robust effects of MA withdrawal observed in MA high drinking than DBA/2J mice. When depression-like symptoms were examined after 1 or 2 weeks of forced abstinence in MA high drinking mice, depression-like symptoms dissipated, and subsequent MA intake was high. The MA high drinking genetic mouse model has strong face validity for human binge MA use and behavioral sequelae associated with abstinence.",addiction; 4-bottle choice; forced abstinence; forced-swim test; selected-lines; tail-suspension test,"Shabani, Shkelzen; Schmidt, Bryan; Ghimire, Bikalpa; Houlton, Sydney K.; Hellmuth, Laura; Mojica, Erika; Phillips, Tamara J.",2019,10.1111/gbb.12533,0,371
393,Treating liquid expulsion in children with feeding disorders,"In the current investigation, we compared and evaluated the effects of two intervention procedures, a modified chin prompt and reclined seating, on the liquid expulsion of 2 children with feeding disorders. For both participants, expulsion decreased to clinically meaningful levels when we added the modified chin prompt or reclined seating to a treatment package consisting of differential reinforcement of acceptance, nonremoval of the cup, and re-presentation.

For all 3 participants, extinction in the form of nonremoval of the spoon led to improvements in inappropriate mealtime behavior and acceptance of bites; however, re-presentation did not reduce expulsion or improve mouth clean.

397,Adolescent victims of commercial sexual exploitation versus sexually abused adolescents,"We have discovered in our clinical review that sexually abused girls have significantly better therapeutic outcomes than girls who have been victims of sex trafficking. Thus, we compared the mental health records of 25 adolescent female victims of commercial sexual exploitation with a group of 25 girls with a history of sexual abuse matched for age. Exclusion criteria included IQ >70, organicity, and psychosis. Victims of sexual exploitation were more likely to be in foster care; to have arrests, suspensions from school, and a history of running away; to abuse drugs; to be more impaired in social and school activities; to be withdrawn and depressed; to manifest social and thought problems and aggressive and rule-breaking behaviors; and to have a diagnosis of mood or conduct disorder or both. The results of this study suggest that the psychopathology of girl victims of sexual exploitation is markedly different from that of sexually abused girls.",,"Shaw, Jon A.; Lewis, John E.; Chitiva, Harvey A.; Pangilinan, Andrew R.",2017,,0,376
399,Mifepristone-misoprostol dosing interval and effect on induction abortion times: A Systematic Review,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of the interval between mifepristone and misoprostol administration on induction time (first misoprostol dose to abortion), total procedure time (mifepristone administration to abortion), and safety and efficacy in second-trimester induction abortion (13-24 weeks). DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE (1966-2012), ClinicalTrials.gov, POPLINE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register using search terms for second trimester, abortion, misoprostol, and mifepristone and reviewed reference lists of published reports. METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Our search revealed 138 articles of which 29 met inclusion criteria: 20 randomized controlled trials and nine observational studies. Studies were included if, in any study arm, mifepristone and misoprostol were used for medical abortion in the second trimester. TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Two authors independently reviewed the articles and abstracted the data using standardized data abstraction templates to summarize data. Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Three studies directly compared a 1-day to 2-day mifepristone-misoprostol interval; they showed small differences in median induction times (weighted average 7.3 hours, range 7-8.5 for a 1-day interval; weighted average 6.8 hours, range 6.3-7.2 for a 2-day interval) and no significant difference in percent expelled by 12 hours or 24 hours. When all randomized studies using mifepristone and misoprostol were pooled by comparable mifepristone-misoprostol interval and misoprostol dose, induction times (first misoprostol dose to expulsion) were only 1-2 hours longer for a 12- to 24-hour interval compared with a 36-48-hour interval, whereas total abortion times (mifepristone to expulsion) were at least 18 hours longer in the 36- to 48-hour group. Induction times varied by misoprostol dosing, with 400-microgram misoprostol protocols resulting in shorter induction times than 200-microgram protocols. CONCLUSION: Shortening the mifepristone-misoprostol interval, thereby reducing total abortion time, does not compromise the safety or efficacy of second-trimester medication abortion and may be used to accommodate patient or health care provider preference. © 2013 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",,"Shaw, Kate A.; Topp, Nicole J.; Shaw, Jonathan G.; Blumenthal, Paul D.",2013,10.1097/AOG.0b013e3182932f37,0,377
400,Use of Texture Fading in the Treatment of Food Selectivity,"Children with feeding disorders often display severe food selectivity. For many of these children, consuming highly textured foods may be aversive or potentially dangerous because of frequent gagging. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of texture fading in the treatment of food selectivity displayed by 4 children. Treatment involved the gradual addition of higher textures based on the results of periodic probes. In addition, food acceptance and swallowing were reinforced, while food refusal and food expulsion were placed on extinction. Results showed that all participants successfully advanced to consumption of age-appropriate texture and volume. The results suggest that texture fading with intermittent probes at higher textures may be an effective method for the treatment of food selectivity by texture.",,"Shore, Bridget A.; Babbitt, Roberta L.; Williams, Keith E.; Coe, David A.; Snyder, Angela",1998,10.1901/jaba.1998.31-621,0,378
401,Assessing ureteral patency using 10% dextrose cystoscopy fluid: Evaluation of urinary tract infection rates,"Background Intravenous indigo carmine has routinely been used to confirm ureteral patency after urogynecologic surgery. Recent discontinuation of the dye has altered clinical practice. In the absence of indigo carmine, we have used 10% dextrose in sterile water (D10) as cystoscopic fluid to evaluate ureteral patency. Glucosuria has been associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) in vivo and significantly enhanced bacterial growth in vitro. The concern is that the use of D10 would mimic a state of glucosuria albeit transient and increase the risk of postoperative UTI. Objectives The objectives of this study were to compare the rates of postoperative UTI and lower urinary tract (LUT) injuries between patients who underwent instillation of D10 vs normal saline at the time of intraoperative cystoscopy after urogynecological surgery. Study Design This was a retrospective cohort study of all women who underwent cystoscopic evaluation of ureteral patency at the time of urogynecological surgery from May through December 2014 at a tertiary care referral center. We compared patients who received D10 cystoscopy fluid vs those who used normal saline. Outcomes included UTI and diagnosis of ureteral or LUT injuries. UTI was diagnosed according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines by symptoms alone, urine dipstick, urinalysis, or urine culture. Descriptive statistics compared the rates of UTI between the 2 groups, and a multivariable model was fit to the data to control for potential confounders and significant baseline differences between the groups. Results A total of 303 women were included. D10 was used in 113 cases and normal saline (NS) was used in 190. The rate of UTI was higher in the D10 group than the NS group: 47.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.3-57.4) vs 25.9% (95% CI, 19.8-32.8, P <.001). After adjusting for age, pelvic organ prolapse stage, use of perioperative estrogen, days of postoperative catheterization, menopausal status, diabetes mellitus, and history of recurrent UTI, the UTI rate remained significantly higher with the use of D10 (adjusted odds ratio, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6-7.5], P =.002) compared with NS. Overall, 3 cases of transient ureteral kinking (1.0%) and one cystotomy (0.3%) were identified intraoperatively. However, ureteral and LUT injuries were not different between groups. No unidentified injuries presented postoperatively. Conclusion Although the use of D10 cystoscopy fluid has been successful in identifying ureteral patency in the absence of indigo carmine, it is associated with an increased rate of postoperative UTI compared with NS.",cystoscopy; dextrose; ureteral patency; urinary tract infection,"Siff, Lauren N.; Unger, Cecile A.; Jelovsek, J.

402,Pharmacokinetics of a New Amphetamine Extended-Release Oral Suspension in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,"Objective: An extended-release amphetamine (AMP) oral suspension has been developed to facilitate medication ingestion and dose titration. This study sought to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of this new formulation in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: This was an open-label, single-period, PK study in 29 pediatric participants with ADHD. Participants were stratified into age groups 1 (6-7 years), 2 (8-9 years), and 3 (10-12 years), and dosed with 15 mL extended-release AMP liquid suspension (equivalent to 30 mg mixed AMP salts) after an overnight fast. Blood samples were collected at prespecified time points and analyzed for d- and l-AMP concentrations. Key PK parameters included maximum plasma concentration (C max ), time to maximum plasma concentration, half-life (T 1/2 ), area under the curve from time 0 to last quantifiable concentration (AUC last ) and to infinity (AUC inf ), oral clearance (CL/F), and volume of distribution (Vz/F). The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) about the geometric means of the weight-normalized CL/F, Vz/F, and AUC last were determined. Safety was also assessed. Results: All participants completed the study. As age increased, mean maximum and total exposure to AMP decreased; weight-normalized CL/F slightly increased, resulting in decreasing T 1/2 values with age. For d- and l-AMP, the 95% CIs for the geometric means of weight-normalized CL/F/kg and Vz/F/kg were within the 60%-140% range for groups 2 and 3, while those of weight-normalized AUC last were within range for all age groups. Adverse events were mild and consistent with the safety profile of AMP. Conclusions: Exposure (C max , AUC inf , and AUC last ) to AMP decreased with age, possibly as a result of the 30-mg/15-mL fixed dose across a range of weights (20-57 kg) and the consequent lower dose per kilogram in older participants, as well as the slight increase in clearance with age.",amphetamine; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; drug delivery; pharmacokinetics; stimulant,"Sikes, Carolyn R.; McMahen, Russ L.; Stark, Jeffrey G.; Engelking, Dorothy",2018,10.1089/cap.2017.0065,0,380
403,Racial/ethnic disparities in parent perception of child need for mental health care following school disciplinary events,"Disciplinary problems at school potentially affect parent perception of child need for mental health care. This article explores effects of a child's first school suspension or expulsion on parent perception of child need for services in three racial-ethnic subgroups. Subjects were mothers participating in a national longitudinal study and their children. First-time school suspension or expulsion positively affected service use and parent-reported service need among white non-Hispanic children, but had little or no effect for African American and Hispanic children. These results suggest that information on child behavior provided to parents by teachers and school administrators can influence parent perception of child service need, but that racial-ethnic differences may exist in parent interpretation of and response to this information. Culturally appropriate approaches to relaying information to parents about child service need may help reduce these differences. © 2004 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",Race; Behavior problems; Suspension; Children; Mental health services; Disparities,"Slade, Eric P.",2004,10.1023/B:MHSR.0000024352.70809.a5,1,381

A cross sectional study","Objective: To test the hypothesis that material disadvantage explains the increased risk among children and young people of adverse health, educational, and behavioural problems associated with living in lone parent households in Britain Study design: Secondary analysis of a cross sectional survey of a representative sample of British households with children and youth Main outcomes: Parent reported fair/poor health, longstanding illness and disability, statement of special educational needs, suspension and/or expulsion from school, and in trouble with the police. Participants: Data were available on 15 636 (8049 boys and 7587 girls) aged 0-18 years in 8541 households in the third sweep (2001) of the British government's families and children study Results: Lone parenthood was associated with increased risk of health and educational problems, and antisocial behaviour among boys and girls in a logistic regression model adjusting for child's age alone. Adding age of main carer, number of dependent children, and child's rank in the household made little difference to the associations. Addition of housing tenure, household hardship index, and an interaction term for lone parenthood and hardship eliminated the relation with lone parenthood for all outcomes except parent reported health among girls. Similar results were obtained for households headed by lone parents for at least a year. An interaction effect of lone parenthood with hardship for parent reported health and statement of special educational needs was noted. Conclusion: Adverse effects of lone parenthood on health, education, and antisocial behaviour were apparently explained by material disadvantage in this cross sectional sample of British households with children and youth.",,"Spencer, Nick",2005,10.1136/jech.2004.020248,0,383
406,‘I still have difficulties feeling like a mother’: The transition to motherhood of preterm infants mothers,"Objective: The premature birth of their infant can constitute a sudden interruption of the transition to motherhood that requires a reorganisation of the process. The present study aimed to analyse the experience of the transition to motherhood of preterm infants’ mothers, framing it within Stern’s transition to motherhood theory. Method: A semi-structured interview was administered to 30 mothers during the recovery of the infant in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The interview explored the experience of mothers related to pregnancy, the infant’s birth and recovery. Results: Thematic Analyses evidenced four interrelated themes: disconnection from the child, perception of maternal inadequacy, loss of parental role and temporal suspension. The themes showed that the mothers’ experience of preterm birth not only concerns the traumatic delivery, but is also embedded in the entire process of becoming a mother within an institutional context. Conclusions: Results were connected to Stern’s theory. Findings revealed difficulties for preterm mothers that could affect the development of the maternal constellation and thus their transition to motherhood. These difficulties may influence the construction of maternal identity, mother’s representation of their child and the bond with their child.",motherhood constellation; preterm birth; thematic analyses; transition to motherhood,"Spinelli, Maria; Frigerio, Alessandra; Montali, Lorenzo; Fasolo, Mirco; Spada, Maria Simonetta; Mangili, Giovanna",2016,10.1080/08870446.2015.1088015,0,384
407,Factors associated with substance use in older homeless adults: Results from the HOPE HOME study,"Background: The median age of the single adult homeless population is 50 and rising. Although the prevalence of substance use decreases as individuals age, older adults now have a higher prevalence of substance use than older adults did 10 years ago. Homeless individuals have a higher prevalence of substance use disorders than the general population. However, little is known about substance use in older homeless adults. Methods: The objective of the study was to examine prevalence of and factors associated with substance use in a population-based sample (N = 350) of homeless individuals aged 50 and older in Oakland, California. Dependent variables included moderate or greater severity illicit drug symptoms (Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) score >3) and moderate or greater alcohol symptoms (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score >7). Independent variables included demographics, mental health problems, and negative life course events such as physical and sexual abuse, school expulsion, and onset of homelessness. Results: Almost two thirds of participants, 64.6%, had moderate or greater severity symptoms for at least 1 illicit drug; 25.8% had moderate or greater severity alcohol symptoms. History of psychiatric hospitalization was associated with moderate or greater illicit drug symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.9, 1.0–3.6). The presence of major depressive symptoms was associated with moderate or greater severity alcohol symptoms (AOR = 1.8, 1.1–3.0). Conclusions: In this sample of older homeless adults, substance use is common. There is a need for substance use treatment programs, integrated with mental health services, which are targeted towards the needs of older homeless adults.",homeless persons; Aging; substance-related disorders,"Spinelli, Matthew A.; Ponath, Claudia; Tieu, Lina; Hurstak, Emily E.; Guzman, David; Kushel, Margot",2017,10.1080/08897077.2016.1264534,0,385
408,Progesterone antagonists and progesterone receptor modulators: An overview,"Since the original description of the structure of the antiprogestin, mifepristone, was published, numerous related compounds have been synthesized which may function as progesterone antagonists (PAs) or progesterone receptor modulators (PRMs). The latter are mixed agonists-antagonists. Both PAs and PRMs have therapeutic applications in female health care. Mifepristone is predominantly a PA and displays only minimum agonist activity in certain systems. Together with a prostaglandin, mifepristone can terminate pregnancies of less than 9 weeks duration, and it may also be used at later gestational ages. Mifepristone causes expulsion of the uterine contents following intrauterine fetal death. A mifepristone-prostaglandin combination has been shown to be very effective treatment in women with menses delay of 11 days or less. Many PAs and PRMs display antiproliferative effects in the endometrium. Serum estradiol levels however remain in the early to mid-follicular phase range. For this reason, they have application in the treatment of endometriosis and myoma without being associated with bone loss and hypoestrogenism. PRMs may also find application in the treatment of dysfunctional bleeding as well as an adjunct to estrogens in hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. Many PAs have contraceptive potential by suppressing follicular development and blocking the LH surge. Low doses may also be potential contraceptives by retarding endometrial maturation without affecting ovulation or inducing bleeding. Mifepristone is an excellent agent for use as an emergency ""postcoital"" contraceptive. PAs may also be useful in IVF programs to prevent a premature LH surge and to delay the emergence of the implantation window. In addition to their use in women's health care, mifepristone and several other PAs are potent antiglucocorticoid agents and may be used to treat ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome. They may also be used in the treatment of tumors containing steroid receptors and in other situations which require suppression of the ACTH-cortisol axis. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

409,A brief DSM-IV-referenced teacher rating scale for monitoring behavioral improvement in ADHD and co-occurring symptoms,"Objective: To examine the psychometric properties of the 30-item teacher's version of the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory Progress Monitor (CASI-PM-T), a DSM-IV-referenced rating scale for monitoring change in ADHD and co-occurring symptoms in youths receiving behavioral or pharmacological interventions. Method: Three separate studies were conducted to determine (a) which items from longer diagnostic instruments were most representative of ADHD and commonly occurring psychiatric syndromes in clinic-referred samples (N = 406) aged between 3 and 18 years, (b) the reliability and validity of the CASI-PM-T in students enrolled in full-time special education programs at the elementary and middle school levels (N = 169), and (c) the clinical utility of measuring behavioral change in a sample of outpatient ADHD children beginning treatment with stimulant medication. Results: Internal consistency reliabilities (.71-.94), 2-week test-retest reliabilities (r = .70-.90), and interrater agreement (r = .44-.78) for the CASI-PM-T symptom categories were comparable to the full-length CASI-4. Convergence was also found between corresponding CASI-PM-T categories and consultant diagnoses of ADHD and ODD as well as school functioning measures of grade-point average and suspensions. The CASI-PM-T also demonstrated sensitivity to stimulant medication treatment effects.

410,Recombinant surfactant protein C-based surfactant for patients with severe direct lung injury,"Rationale: Patients with acute lung injury have impaired function of the lung surfactant system. Prior clinical trials have shown that treatment with exogenous recombinant surfactant protein C (rSP-C)-based surfactant results in improvement in blood oxygenation and have suggested that treatment of patients with severe direct lung injury may decrease mortality. Objectives: Determine the clinical benefit of administering an rSP-C-based synthetic surfactant to patients with severe direct lung injury due to pneumonia or aspiration. Methods:Aprospective randomized blinded study was performed at 161 centers in 22 countries. Patients were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus up to eight doses of rSP-C surfactant administered over 96 hours (n 5 419) or only usual care (n 5 424). Measurements and Main Results: Mortality to28 days after treatment, the requirement for mechanical ventilation, and the number of nonpulmonary organ failure-free days were not different between studygroups.Incontrasttoprior studies,there wasnoimprovement in oxygenation in patients receiving surfactant compared with the usual care group. Investigation of the possible reasons underlying the lack of efficacy suggested a partial inactivation of rSP-C surfactant caused by a step of the resuspension process that was introduced with this study. Conclusions: In this study, rSP-C-based surfactant was of no clinical benefit to patients with severe direct lung injury. The unexpected lack of improvement in oxygenation, coupled with the results of in vitrotests, suggest that the administered suspension may have had insufficient surface activity to achieve clinical benefit.

411,The Importance of School: Protecting At-Risk Youth From Early Offending,"Using longitudinal data, this study explored the protective effect of a school bond (on violent and nonviolent delinquency) across a variety of risk factors. A strong school bond protected children with early aggression from continuing on in violence 2 years later. A strong school bond also protected children with numerous environmental risks from violent and nonviolent offending. Finally, a strong school bond acted as a protective factor against the influence of peers who were delinquent (for nonviolent offending only). From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that zero-tolerance polices that aim to exclude children considered to be a problem through suspensions or expulsions could be counterproductive. © 2005, Sage Publications.

412,Detection of colistin heteroresistance in Acinetobacter baumannii from blood and respiratory isolates,"Polymyxins are one of the last-line antibiotics for multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Reports have demonstrated the emergence of colistin heteroresistance in A. baumannii, which can complicate assessment of minimum inhibitory concentrations and promote resistance to colistin. We aimed to determine the presence of colistin heteroresistance in A. baumannii isolates and correlate the results with clinical and microbiological outcomes via a retrospective study of 24 adult patients: 12 blood and 12 invasive respiratory cultures positive for colistin-susceptible A. baumannii between 1 January 2013 and 31 July 2015. Heteroresistance testing was performed by plating a 100-μL bacterial cell suspension on Mueller–Hinton agar plates containing 0, 1, 2, and 4 μg/mL colistin, and assessing for growth at 24 and 48 h. Colistin heteroresistance was exhibited in 83% of isolates. Median age was 56 [43–65] years, 10 (42%) patients resided at a facility prior to admission, 5 (21%) had a chronic tracheostomy, 18 (75%) were in the intensive care unit at the time of culture collection, and median infection-related length of stay was 12 [7–15] days. Clinical and microbiological cures were achieved in 75% of patients. Overall infection-related mortality was 21%. Our study demonstrated a high rate of colistin heteroresistance in clinical isolates of colistin-susceptible A. baumannii, although this was not associated with suboptimal clinical outcomes due to the use of aggressive colistin dosing and combination therapy. Further studies are needed to establish the association between in vitro colistin heteroresistance and clinical and microbiological outcomes.",Acinetobacter baumannii; Colistin; Colistin heteroresistance; Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms; Polymyxin B; Polymyxins,"Srinivas, Pavithra; Hunt, Lauren N.; Pouch, Stephanie M.; Thomas, Keelie; Goff, Debra A.; Pancholi, Preeti; Balada-Llasat, Joan Miquel; Bauer, Karri A.",2018,10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2018.01.028,0,390
413,Percutaneous liver biopsy in Fontan patients,"Background: Patients who have undergone the Fontan operation for palliation of congenital heart disease with single-ventricle pathophysiology are at high risk for developing progressive liver fibrosis. Pathological assessment from percutaneous liver biopsy is central to the management of Fontan-associated liver disease, but liver biopsy in this vulnerable population poses unique challenges and potential risks. Objective: This retrospective study describes our experience with percutaneous liver biopsy performed to assess changes of Fontan-associated liver disease, with particular regard to procedural outcomes. Materials and methods: Data from liver biopsy procedure reports, pathology reports, cardiac angiography pressure measurements and laboratory values of patients with single ventricle heart disease after the Fontan operation who underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy performed in interventional radiology at a pediatric tertiary care center during a 3-year period were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Sixty-eight liver biopsies were performed in 67 patients (mean age: 20.2 years, range: 7.2–39 years). The technical success rate was 100%, and tissue was adequate for assessing liver disease in 100% of the procedures, including biopsies performed with a single pass. Anticoagulation was routinely suspended before biopsy, and no cardiac complications were encountered due to this suspension. A coaxial biopsy system using an 18-gauge (G) full-core instrument through a 17-G introducer trocar was most commonly used, in 41/68 cases (60%). The most common trough length was 2.3 cm, used in 37 cases (54%). One pass was made in 27 procedures (40%) and two passes in 30 (44%); tract embolization with gelatin sponge was performed in 52 (76%). The only complication was hemorrhage, which occurred in 5/68 (7.4%) of the biopsies, minor in four (5.9%) and major in one (1.5%) -- similar to rates reported for liver biopsy in non-Fontan patients. Hemorrhage had a delayed presentation in three of these five cases. Immediate post-biopsy hemoglobin decrease of ≥2 mg/dL showed a low sensitivity for hemorrhage. The mean Fontan pressure measured during cardiac angiography was 13.8 mmHg, and shunt pressures were not associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage.

414,Childcare providers' use of practices to promote young children's social-emotional competence,"Findings are presented regarding childcare providers' use of evidence-based strategies to promote preschoolers' social-emotional competence in 38 urban childcare classrooms. Descriptive results from classroom observations and childcare teachers' interviews indicated that in the absence of training, childcare teaching staff implemented few of these strategies. Teachers also reported a lack of infrastructure elements such as professional development, a leadership team, data-based tools for decision making, and monetary resources that are associated with the adoption and sustained use of strategies. Findings are described and recommendations are presented to support implementation of practices associated with young children's social-emotional competence in childcare settings.",Preschool; Challenging behavior; Childcare; Social-emotional,"Steed, Elizabeth A.; Roach, Andrew T.",2017,10.1097/IYC.0000000000000092,1,392
415,Compliance issues related to the selection of antibiotic suspensions for children,"Objective. To evaluate the palatability, cost and other compliance issues as variables in the selection of antibiotic suspensions for children. Methods. Eighty-six physicians and health care personnel randomly sampled amoxicillin (used as a standard for comparison) and 11 other antibiotics, evaluating them in categories of appearance, smell, texture, taste and aftertaste. Overall scoring was then adjusted for cost, duration of therapy and dosing intervals. Results. Overall taste (palatability) ranking of antibiotics, highest to lowest, was as follows: loracarbef, cefdinir, cefixime, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clarithromycin, trimethoprim, amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime. Overall rating of antibiotics was greatly influenced by other compliance variables, in order of their impact: cost; duration of therapy (5 vs. 10 days); and dosing intervals. Cost was not judged to be a major factor by most participants unless antibiotic expense was >$50.00 for treatment of otitis media in our hypothetical 2-year-old, 13-kg child. Taking all variables into consideration, final ranking from highest to lowest was azithromycin, cefdinir, loracarbef, cefixime, amoxicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefpodoxime, trimethoprim, clarithromycin, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime and amoxicillin/clavulanate. Conclusions. Variables related to compliance for families filling antibiotic prescriptions and children taking these products are important in the selection of antimicrobial therapy. Because final assessment is likely to vary considerably among health care personnel, decisions must be made on an individual basis.",Antibiotic adherence; Antibiotic compliance; Antibiotic cost; Antibiotic suspensions; Antibiotic taste; Antibiotics; Antimicrobial agents,"Steele, Russell W.; Thomas, Mathew P.; Bégué, Rodolfo E.",2001,10.1097/00006454-200101000-00001,0,393
416,Vestibular Dysfunction in Young Children with Minor Neurological Impairment,"Two aspects of vestibular functioning—post‐rotatory nystagmus, and head righting with and without vision—were compared in a group of referred and a group of control children. The control group (A) comprised 44 randomly selected pre‐school children (22 boys, 22 girs) with an age range of 4 years 9 months to 5 years 9 months and a mean age of 5 years 2 months. 25 children (23 boys, two girls) of normal intelligence, referred with minimal neurological impairment, comprised Group B. The age range was 3 years 10 months to 5 years 11 months and the mean age was five years. Group A all developed a normal post‐rotatory nystagmus following spinning, compared with three in Group B. Abnormal responses shown by the Group B children included: absent post‐rotatory nystagmus (13); large‐amplitude nystagmus (1); very fine, shimmering nystagmus (4); and such extreme loss of tone and/or fear on spinning that further investigation was not possible (4). The mean duration of post‐rotatory nystagmus for Group A was 15.6 seconds (range 8 to 28 seconds), compared with a mean duration of 3. 7 seconds (range 4 to 16 seconds) for Group B. In head righting, the greatest difference between the two groups was found in labyrinthine righting (without vision) in horizontal suspension. All of Group A corrected their heads, whereas 88 per cent of Group B showed no head correction in the four positions examined. 92 per cent of Group B showed extreme changes in postural tone, compared with none of Group A. In vertical suspension without vision, 69 per cent of Group B did not correct their heads, compared with 8.5 per cent of Group A. Combined optical and labyrinthine head‐righting, with vision, was examined. In horizontal suspension, all of Group A corrected their heads, compared with 28 per cent of Group B. None of Group A showed extreme tone changes, compared with 64 per cent of Group B. The least difference was found between the two groups in vertical suspension with vision, when 64 per cent of Group B corrected their heads, compared with 96 per cent of Group A. These results show that alteration in post‐rotatory nystagmus and abnormalities in head‐righting are frequently found in children of normal intelligence presenting with educational or behavioural problems. Troubles vestibulaires chez les jeunes enfants présentant des anomalies neurologiques mineures Deux aspects du fonctionnement vestibulaire—le nystagmus post‐rotatoire et le re‐dressement de la tẽte avec ou sans vision—sont comparés entre un groupe d'enfants d'intelligence normale adressés avec des anomalies neurologiques minimes et un groupe contrõle. Le groupe contrõle (A) comprenait 44 enfants de maternelle choisis au hasard (22 garçons et 22 filles) ãgés de quatre ans neuf mois à cinq ans neuf mois (moyenne d'ãge de cinq ans deux mois). Le groupe B comprenait les 25 enfants adressés en consultation (23 garcons et 2 filles) ãgés de trois ans dix mois à cinq ans onze mois (moyenne de cinq ans). Tous les enfants du groupe A présentèrent un nystagmus post‐rotatoire normal apres rotation sur l'axe et trois enfants seulement dans le groupe B. Des réponses anormales présentées par les enfants du groupe B incluaient: l'absence de nystagmus post‐rotatoire (13), un nystagmus de grande amplitude (un); un nystagmus tremblé très fin (quatre) et de telles pertes de tonus et/ou une peur de la rotation que les investigation ultérieures ne furent pas possible (quatre). La durée moyenne du nystagmus rotatoire dans le groupe A fut de 14,6 secondes (écart de 8 à 28 secondes) tandis que la durée moyenne était de 3,7 secondes (écart de quatre à 16 secondes) pour le groupe B. Dans le redressement de la tẽte, la plus grande différence entre les deux groupes fut trouvée dans le redressement labyrinthique (examinés sans vision) en suspension horizontale. Tous les enfants du groupe A corrigèrent la position de leur těte, tandis que 88 pour cent du groupe B ne montrèrent pas de correction de la těte dans les quatre positions étudiées. 92 pour cent du groupe B présèntment des modifications extrěmes du tonus postural tandis qu'il n'y avait aucune modification dans le groupe A. En suspension verticale, sans vision, 69 pour cent du groupe B ne corrigèrent pas leur těte, ce chiffre n'étant que de 8,5 pour cent dans le groupe A. Le redressement de la těte combine, optique et labyrinthique, fut examiné avec vision. En suspension horizontale, tous les enfants du groupe A corrigèrent leur těte comparés au 64 pour cent du groupe B. Les différences les plus faibles entre les deux groupes furent trouvees en suspension verticale et vision, avec 64 pour cent de redressement de la těte dans le groupe B et 96 pour cent dans le groupe A. Ces résultats montrent qu'une altération dans le nystagmus post‐rotatoire et les anomalies dans le redressement de la těte sont fréquemment observés chez les enfants d'intelligence normale consultant pour des problèmes éducatifs de comportement. Störungen der Vestibularisfunktion beijungen Kindern mit geringen neurologischen Störungen Bei einer Gruppe von Kindern mit normaler Intelligenz, jedoch mit geringen neurologischen Störungen und bei einer Kontrollgruppe wurden zwei Aspekte der Vestibularisfunktion verglichen—postrotatorischer Nystagmus und Kopfstellreflexe. Die Kontrollgruppe (A) bestand aus 44 zufällig ausgewählten Kindern im Vorschulalter (22 Jungen und 22 Mädchen) im Alter zwischen vier Jahren neun Monate und fünf Jahren neun Monate (Durchschnittsalter fünf Jahre zwei Monate). In der Gruppe B wurden 25 von den oben beschriebenen Kindern (23 Jungen und zwei Mädchen) im Alter von drei Jahren zehn Monate bis zu fünf Jahren 11 Monate (Durchschnittsalter fünf Jahre) zusammengefasst. In der Gruppe A hatten alle Kinder einen normalen postrotatorischen Nystagmus nach dem Drehen, verglichen mit nur drei Kindern der Gruppe B. Bei den behinderten Kindern fielen folgende nicht normale Reaktionen auf: fehlender postrotatorischer Nystagmus (13), hochamplitudiger Nystagmus (1), sehr feinschlägiger Nystagmus (4); und auffälliger Tonusverlust der Muskulatur und/oder Furcht beim Drehen, so dass die Untersuchung nicht fortgesetzt werden konnte (4). Die durchschnittliche Dauer des postrotatorischen Nystagmus betrug bei der Gruppe A 14–6 Sekunden (Schwankungsbreite zwischen 8 und 28 Sekunden) verglichen mit einer mittleren Dauer von 3–7 Sekunden (Schwankungsbreite 4 bis 16 Sekunden) für die Gruppe B. Bei den Kopfstellreflexen fand man den grössten Unterschied zwischen den beiden Gruppen beim Labyrinthstellreflex (mit geschlossenen Augen) in horizontaler Lage. Alle Kinder der Gruppe A stellten ihren Kopf ein, während 88 Prozent der Gruppe B in alien untersuchten Positionen ihren Kopf nicht einstellten. 92 Prozent der Gruppe B zeigten extreme Schankungen im Haltetonus verglichen mit keinem Kind der Gruppe A. In verti‐kaler Lage bei geschlossenen Augen stellten 69 Prozent der Kinder der Gruppe B ihren Kopf nicht ein im Vergleich zu nur 8.5 Prozent der Gruppe A. Die kombinierte Untersuchung von optischen Stellreflexen und Labyrinthstellreflexen erfolgte mit offenen Augen. In horizontaler Lage stellten alle Kinder der Gruppe A ihren Kopf ein verglichen mit 64 Prozent der Gruppe B. Der geringste Unterschied zwischen den beiden Gruppen wurde in vertikaler Lage mit offenen Augen gefunden, hierbei stellten 64 Prozent der Gruppe B ihren Kopf ein im Vergleich zu 96 Prozent der Gruppe A. Diese Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Veränderungen beim postrotatorischen Nystagmus und Abweichungen bei den Kopfstellreflexen häufig bei Kindern mit normaler Intelligenz aber mit Verhaltens‐ und Erziehungsproblemen nachweisbar sind.

417,Impact of vaccine shortages on immunization programs and providers,"Background: During 2001 and the first half of 2002, the United States experienced severe shortages of five of the eight universally recommended vaccines for children. Objective: To evaluate the impact of shortages of diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), and tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td) shortages on state and urban area immunization programs and immunization providers between September 2001 and January 2002. Methods: (1) Survey of state and urban area immunization program managers. Outcome measures included changes in vaccine distribution and suspension of daycare/Head Start and school entry immunization requirements for Td, DTaP, and PCV7. (2) Interviews with Vaccines for Children Program immunization providers scheduled to receive a routine site visit between January 21 and February 1, 2002. Outcome measures included problems experienced with vaccine orders, implementation of Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) interim recommendations for DTaP and PCV7, and length of time with no DTaP or PCV7 vaccines in stock. Results: Over 85% of immunization programs changed the way they distributed PCV7, DTaP, and Td vaccines to providers, including limiting the amount of vaccine ordered or distributing partial orders. Additionally, 76% of programs experienced problems purchasing or receiving varicella vaccine. Sixty-eight percent of programs suspended school entry requirements for Td. Immunization providers reported problems with orders of Td (56%), PCV7 (45%), DTaP (30%), and varicella (29%). Approximately 16% and 29% of providers implemented the interim ACIP recommendations for DTaP and PCV7, respectively. However, 21% of providers suspended administration of all doses of PCV7 because they ran out of vaccine before learning of the shortage. Conclusions: From suspension of school entry requirements to delaying administration of vaccine, the recent vaccine shortages affected immunization programs' and providers' ability to administer vaccines in a timely manner.",,"Stokley, Shannon; Santoli, Jeanne M.; Willis, Bayo; Kelley, Vanda; Vargas-Rosales, Anjella; Rodewald, Lance E.",2004,10.1016/j.amepre.2003.09.010,0,395
419,Closing the praziquantel treatment gap: New steps in epidemiological monitoring and control of schistosomiasis in African infants and preschool-aged children,"Where very young children come into contact with water containing schistosome cercariae, infections occur and schistosomiasis can be found. In high transmission environments, where mothers daily bathe their children with environmentally drawn water, many infants and preschool-aged children have schistosomiasis. This ""new"" burden, inclusive of co-infections with Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma mansoni, is being formally explored as infected children are not presently targeted to receive praziquantel (PZQ) within current preventive chemotherapy campaigns. Thus an important PZQ treatment gap exists whereby infected children might wait up to 4-5 years before receiving first treatment in school. International treatment guidelines, set within national treatment platforms, are presently being modified to provide earlier access to medication(s). Although detailed pharmacokinetic studies are needed, to facilitate pragmatic dosing in the field, an extended ""dose pole"" has been devised and epidemiological monitoring has shown that administration of PZQ (40 mg/kg), in either crushed tablet or liquid suspension, is both safe and effective in this younger age-class; drug efficacy, however, against S. mansoni appears to diminish after repeated rounds of treatment. Thus use of PZQ should be combined with appropriate health education/water hygiene improvements for both child and mother to bring forth a more enduring solution.

420,Educational outcomes in a system of care for children with emotional disturbance,"In North Carolina, only 69% of high school students graduate in 4years; however, recent data suggest that only 42% of students with mental and emotional disabilities graduate. MeckCARES, a system of care (SOC) in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, is designed to serve youth with severe emotional disturbances and their families. The SOC philosophy is a prominent family-focused approach intended to provide comprehensive, coordinated networks of services, tailored to the needs of the child and family, while emphasizing the strengthening of natural community supports. In addition to other mental health objectives, a particular goal of MeckCARES is to address specific school-based needs of system-identified youth to improve educational outcomes and reduce the risk of dropping out. This study sought to assess empirically the impact that enrollment in MeckCARES has on graduation precursors; namely, grades, suspensions, and absences. This study found that, on average, enrollment in MeckCARES is not associated with positive changes in educational variables. Implications of these findings are discussed, as are future directions. For example, additional research is needed with more sensitive measurement and data collection procedures (i.e., access to graduation rates and Medicaid information) to adequately assess the impact of enrollment in MeckCARES on educational outcomes. © 2012 American Orthopsychiatric Association.","Systems of care; High school dropouts; High school graduation rates; Individualized education plan; MeckCARES; Mecklenburg County, NC; Severe emotional disturbances; Youth with mental or emotional disabilities","Strompolis, Melissa; Vishnevsky, Tanya; Reeve, Charlie L.; Munsell, Eylin Palamaro; Cook, James R.; Kilmer, Ryan P.",2012,10.1111/j.1939-0025.2011.01126.x,1,397
421,Predictors of protocol adherence in a pediatric asthma clinical trial,"Background: Declining protocol adherence can threaten the validity of a clinical trial. Objective: We sought to explore patient and family factors important for protocol adherence in the 133 patients followed at one of the 8 Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) clinical centers. Difficulties with timely return of diary cards (diary card problem), with keeping or frequently rescheduling appointments (appointment problem), and with commitment to all aspects of the trial (commitment problem) were tracked prospectively during the treatment phase of CAMP, which ranged from 20 to 40 months at the time of the analysis. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis. Results: During the course of this investigation, no St Louis CAMP patients dropped out of the study, although signs of eroding participation were observed in 44% of patients. For this cross-sectional analysis, the percentage of patients exhibiting protocol-adherence problems was greater the longer patients had been in the trial: 33.3% at 20 to 25 months, 39.5% at 26 to 30 months, 51.4% at 31 to 35 months, and 69.2% at 36 to 40 months (P < .01). The diary card problem was present in 22.2% of the patients enrolled in the trial for 20 to 25 months compared with 66.7% for patients enrolled for 36 to 40 months (P < .005). Appointment and commitment problems were present in smaller percentages of patients and did not change by time in the trial (P = .41 and .22, respectively). A logistic regression analysis of demographic characteristics indicated that age at randomization and time in the trial were significant factors: for every 2-year increase in age, a child was twice as likely to have a commitment problem (odds ratio [OR], 1.96; 95% CI, 1.50-2.57), and for each additional 5 months of participation in the study, a child was twice as likely to have a diary card problem (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.76-2.07). There was no influence of family income, patient race, or patient sex on the occurrence of any of the 3 protocol-adherence problems. A similar analysis of psychologic characteristics of the child and family indicated (1) a 2-fold increase in the risk of a diary card problem with a 10% increase in the percentage of total commissions on the attention scale of the Gordon Diagnostic Study (OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 2.02-2.35), (2) a 2-fold decrease in the risk of an appointment problem with a 10-unit increase in the Child Manifest Anxiety Scale (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.44-0.49), (3) a 2-fold decrease in risk of an appointment problem with a 10-unit increase in the cohesion subscale of the Family Environment Scale (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.55-0.60), and (4) a 5-fold decrease in the risk of a commitment problem with a 10-unit increase in the Child Depression Index score (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.18-0.24). Conclusions: Adherence and retention problems commonly occur in longer clinical trials. CAMP patients and families were selected in part on the basis of likelihood of being able to participate in the trial to enhance the conclusions of the trial. Despite this selection process, adherence problems were noted. Problems increased with duration of participation, increasing child age, and the presence of less family cohesion or attention problems in the child. In contrast, the presence of mild emotional distress (anxiety and depression) in the child was associated with fewer protocol-adherence problems. Incorporating procedures that help anticipate and identify adherence problems early might improve continued participation in all aspects of a trial and even retention in long-term clinical trials.",Retention; Adherences; Pediatric asthma clinical trial,"Strunk, Robert C.; Bender, Bruce; Young, David A.; Sagel, Sharon; Glynn, Emily; Caesar, Mary; Lawhon, Claire",2002,10.1067/mai.2002.128803,0,398
422,A comparison of flipped-spoon presentation and redistribution to decrease packing in children with feeding disorders,"For children with feeding disorders, nonremoval procedures combined with reinforcement are often used by practitioners to treat initial food refusal (Volkert et al., 2016; Volkert & Piazza, 2012). However, this treatment may not always be sufficient to increase food consumption because problematic behaviors such as packing (holding food in the mouth) or expulsion emerge. Antecedent- and consequence-based interventions have both been effective to decrease packing (or increase mouth clean) in children with feeding disorders. Depositing the bite using a flipped spoon or Nuk upon presentation has been shown to increase mouth clean (Sharp, Harker et al., 2010; Wilkens et al., 2014), and redistribution and/or swallow facilitation havebeen effective to decrease packing (Gulotta et al., 2005; Volkert et al., 2011). To our knowledge, flipped-spoon presentation and redistribution have not been directly compared to reduce packing, and this was the aim of the current study.",Feeding disorders; Flipped spoon; Food refusal; Packing; Redistribution,"Stubbs, Kathryn H.; Volkert, Valerie M.; Rubio, Emily Kate; Ottinger, Elissa",2018,10.1016/j.lmot.2017.03.007,0,399
423,An in vitro thymidine incorporation assay for human cancers: Technical details revisited,"Among the choices of laboratory methods for in vitro testing of human tumor chemosensitivity, a thymidine incorporation assay (TIA) has been described. Advantages of a TIA over a colony‐forming assay include greater probability of tumor growth, requirement for fewer tumor cells, less dependence on an absolute single‐cell suspension, shorter time to completion, and the ability to measure up to three logs cell‐kill. Specific technical details which are reported in the literature for performing a TIA are incomplete and/or conflicting between one laboratory and another. This paper reports details of methods designed to remove unbound 3[H]‐thymidine from the agarose, standardize background counts, and determine optimal cell‐plating densities, labeling time, optimal concentration of 3[H]‐thymidine, and the best day after seeding cultures to add the 3[H]‐thymidine. Care has been taken to compare the end point of drug sensitivity determinations following these methodologic changes, both among serial TIAs as well as with colony‐forming assays.

424,Clinical need for a nebulized corticosteroid,"Asthma is a leading cause of morbidity in children, leading to frequent emergency room visits and hospitalizations. In recent years, a steady increase in the number of cases of pediatric asthma has been observed. Mortality rates among children also have increased. The diagnosis of asthma in infants and young children relies on symptoms, and most children become symptomatic before the age of 2 years. The prognosis of an individual child is difficult to predict because of a lack of clear markers; however, respiratory symptoms that begin at, or persist through, the ages of 3 to 4 years are significantly associated with future asthma. The inflammatory nature of asthma has prompted recommendations for the routine use of inhaled corticosteroids for all patients with persistent asthma. Studies have indicated that early initiation of corticosteroid therapy can reduce airway inflammation and may prevent more serious asthma or irreversible obstruction in later years. Although treatment guidelines recommend the use of inhaled corticosteroids in infants and children younger than 5 years of age, metered-dose and dry-powder inhalers may be difficult for this population to use because of a lack of coordination or understanding. In addition, there are no commercially available inhaled corticosteroids for use in children younger than 4 years of age in the United States.

425,Budesonide inhalation suspension: A nebulized corticosteroid for persistent asthma,"Guidelines for managing asthma in pediatric patients published by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend the use of inhaled corticosteroids for the management of persistent asthma in infants and young children. When these guidelines were published, pressurized metered-dose inhalers and dry-powder inhalers were the only delivery devices available for inhaled corticosteroids in the United States. These devices can be difficult for young children to use correctly. Furthermore, no inhaled corticosteroid was approved in the United States for the treatment of children younger than 4 years. Budesonide inhalation suspension (Pulmicort Respules; AstraZeneca LP, Wilmington, Del) was developed to meet the medication delivery needs of infants and young children with persistent asthma. Pulmicort Respules is the first inhaled corticosteroid approved for administration by means of a nebulizer and the only inhaled corticosteroid approved in the United States for infants as young as 12 months. Budesonide has been studied extensively worldwide. In the United States the tolerability and efficacy of budesonide inhalation suspension were confirmed in 3 placebo-controlled multicenter trials. These studies demonstrated that both once- and twice-daily dosing of bodesonide inhalation suspension (0.25-1 mg) improved pulmonary function and ameliorated asthma symptoms in infants and young children with persistent asthma. Budesonide inhalation suspension was well tolerated, and the incidences of reported adverse events were similar among patients in the budesonide, placebo, and conventional asthma therapy groups. This article reviews the results of these studies, as well as the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical use of budesonide inhalation suspension.",Safety; Efficacy; Pediatric; Asthma; Budesonide; Inhaled corticosteroid; Budesonide inhalation suspension; Pulmicort Respules,"Szefler, Stanley J.; Eigen, Howard",2002,10.1067/mai.2002.122712,0,402
426,Factors Associated with the Use of Postoperative Analgesics in Patients Undergoing Direct Microlaryngoscopy,"Objective: Morbidity associated with suspension laryngoscopy has been well documented. However, standard of care with regard to postoperative analgesia has not been described, and anecdotal evidence suggests wide variability with regard to postoperative narcotic and non-narcotic recommendations. We sought to quantify the postoperative course following suspension microlaryngoscopy by relating patient-based and intraoperative measures with analgesic use. Methods: Body mass index (BMI), Friedman tongue position (FTP), and Mallampati scores as well as laryngoscope type, number of attempts required for optimal visualization, and suspension time were documented in 50 consecutive patients undergoing routine suspension microlaryngoscopy. Postoperative symptoms and analgesic use was queried on postoperative days 1, 3, and 10. Results: In this cohort, 62.5% employed postoperative analgesia. However, only 20% required narcotics. No difference in suspension time was identified in those taking analgesics (33.0 vs 37.3 minutes, P =.44). In addition, no relationship between procedure type and the need for analgesia was noted. The majority of patients (76%) described sore throat persisting for 3 postoperative days; 36% reported sore throat persisting beyond postoperative day 3. Conclusions: The majority of patients undergoing microlaryngoscopy reported discomfort, but symptoms were largely ameliorated with over-the-counter analgesics. Routine prescription of narcotics following routine suspension laryngoscopy may be unnecessary.",analgesia; body mass index; direct laryngoscopy; Friedman tongue position; narcotic; phonomicrosurgery; suspension laryngoscopy; voice,"Taliercio, Salvatore; Sanders, Brian; Achlatis, Stratos; Fang, Yixin; Branski, Ryan; Amin, Milan",2017,10.1177/0003489417693862,0,403
428,Asystole During Direct Laryngoscopy for Vocal Fold Injection in a Healthy Patient,"Objectives This study aims (1) to present a case of asystole during direct laryngoscopy in an otherwise healthy patient at an outpatient surgery center and (2) to review literature on cardiac complications, specifically asystole and bradycardia, during direct laryngoscopy. Methods A 67-year-old woman with no prior cardiac history underwent induction with succinylcholine and remifentanil for direct laryngoscopy and vocal fold augmentation. During suspension laryngoscopy, the patient became asystolic, and advanced care life support measures were started. The patient regained a cardiac rhythm after chest compressions and epinephrine and was transferred to a tertiary care hospital for further treatment. She remained intubated overnight, requiring pressors, and regained normal cardiac function over the next few days. Results A structured literature review uncovered few reports of asystole during suspension laryngoscopy. Although bradycardia is common during suspension laryngoscopy, likely secondary to stimulation of afferent visceral sensory parasympathetic fibers of the vagus nerve, asystole is rare. Conclusions Cardiac complications are possible in otolaryngologic surgery, especially with activation of the oculocardiac or trigeminocardiac reflexes. Asystole during direct laryngoscopy, although rare, is not always predictable from medicine or cardiac risk indices. Awareness, rapid recognition, and early implementation of advanced care life support are crucial to avoid further complications.",Asystole; Bradycardia; Direct laryngoscopy; Vagal stimulation; Vocal cord injection,"Taufique, Zahrah; Dion, Gregory R.; Amin, Milan R.",2017,10.1016/j.jvoice.2016.12.019,0,404
429,Children who return home from foster care: a 6-year prospective study of behavioral health outcomes in adolescence.,"OBJECTIVE: Returning children to their biological families after placement in foster care (ie, reunification) has been prioritized with legislation. Comprehensive studies of child behavioral health functioning after reunification, however, have not been conducted. This study examined outcomes for youth who were reunified after placement in foster care as compared with youth who did not reunify. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Children who entered foster care in San Diego, California, and who remained in foster care for at least 5 months. Participants. A cohort of 149 ethnically diverse youth, 7 to 12 years old, who entered foster care between May 1990, and October 1991. Seventy-five percent of those interviewed at Time 1 were interviewed at Time 2 (6 years later). OUTCOME MEASURES: 1) Risk behaviors: delinquent, sexual, self-destructive, substance use, and total risk behaviors; 2) Life-course outcomes: pregnancy, tickets/arrests, suspensions, dropping out of school, and grades; 3) Current symptomatology: externalizing, internalizing, total behavior problems, and total competence. RESULTS: Compared with youth who were not reunified, reunified youth showed more self-destructive behavior (0.15 vs -0.11), substance use (0.16 vs -0.11), and total risk behavior problem standardized scores (0.12 vs -0.09). Reunified youth were more likely to have received a ticket or have been arrested (49.2% vs 30.2%), to have dropped out of school (20.6% vs 9.4%), and to have received lower grades (6.5 vs 7.4). Reunified youth reported more current problems in internalizing behaviors (56.6 vs 53.0), and total behavior problems (59.5 vs 55.7), and lower total competence (41.1 vs 45.0). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on delinquency, sexual behaviors, pregnancy, suspensions, or externalizing behaviors. Reunification status was a significant predictor of negative outcomes in 8 of the 9 regression equations after controlling for Time 1 behavior problems, age, and gender.

430,The relationship between time spent living with kin and adolescent functioning in youth with a history of out-of-home placement,"Objective: Many children in the US who are court-ordered to live in out-of-home care are placed with kinship caregivers. Few studies have examined the impact of living with kin on child well-being. This study examined the relationship between length of time living with kin and indices of adolescent well-being in a cohort of children who were initially court-ordered into out-of-home care. Methods: Prospective cohort design with 148 youth, ages 7-12, who entered out-of-home care between May, 1990, and October, 1991. Seventy-five percent of those interviewed at T1 (6 months following placement) were interviewed at T2 (5 years later). Results: Bivariate analyses did not demonstrate significant relationships between length of time living with kin and the outcome variables. In multivariate analyses, longer length of time living with kin was related to: (1) greater involvement in risk behaviors including: delinquency (β= .22, p< .05), sexual risk behaviors (β= .31, p< .05), substance use (β= .26, p< .05), and total risk behaviors (β= .27, p< .05), and (2) poorer life-course outcomes including: Tickets/Arrests (OR= 1.4, p< .05) and lower grades (β= -.24, p< .05). Time living with kin was not related to total competence, or self-destructive, internalizing, externalizing, or total behavior problems. There were trends (p< .10) for time living with kin to predict greater trauma symptomatology (β= .17) and suspensions (OR= 1.1). Conclusions: There were no significant bivariate findings. The multivariate findings suggested a pattern of poorer functioning for youth who spent more time living with kin. No differences were found in current symptomatology. Practice implications: Although findings from a single study should not dictate changes in practice or policy, the current study's findings do suggest that the field needs to conduct more methodologically sophisticated research on the impact of kinship care. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Adolescence; Foster care; Child abuse; Kinship care; Risk behaviors,"Taussig, Heather N.; Clyman, Robert B.",2011,10.1016/j.chiabu.2010.09.001,0,406
431,A study of zero tolerance policies in schools: A multi-integrated systems approach to improve outcomes for adolescents,"PROBLEM: School officials throughout the United States have adopted zero tolerance policies to address student discipline, resulting in an increase in out-of-school suspensions and expulsions. The introduction of police on school campuses also increased the referral of students to the juvenile courts. Although school personnel generally view zero tolerance policies as a constructive measure, this approach denies recent research on adolescent brain development that mischief is a foreseeable derivative of adolescence. METHODS: A case study method examined one juvenile court's innovative multi-integrated systems approach related to the adverse trends associated with zero tolerance policies. FINDINGS: A multi-disciplinary protocol resulted in more effective youth assessments that reduced out-of-school suspensions and school referrals; increased graduation rates by 20%; and decreased delinquent felony rates by nearly 50%. The resulting protocol changed how the system responds to disruptive students by significantly reducing out-of-school suspensions and school referrals, and putting into place alternatives as well as providing community resources to address the underlying causes of the behavior. CONCLUSION: A multi-systems approach that targets the reasons for disruptive behavior improves student educational and behavioral outcomes. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Suspension; Delinquency; Racial disparity; School-to-prison pipeline; Criminogenic need; Linear programming model; Multi-integrated systems model; Protective factor; Risk principle; Zero tolerance,"Teske, Steven C.",2011,10.1111/j.1744-6171.2011.00273.x,0,407
432,Duration of extended parental care in marine amphipods,"Several peracarid species provide parental care for their growing offspring after these have left the brood pouch of the female. In this study, I examined the duration of extended parental care in 3 soft-bottom dwelling amphipod species: the epibenthic suspension feeder Dyopedos monacanthus (Podoceridae), the burrow-dwelling filter-feeder Leptocheirus pinguis (Aoridae), and the burrow-dwelling deposit-feeder Casco bigelowi (Melitidae). Juvenile D. monacanthus remained on the mud whip of their mother for time periods of 10-20 days, maximally 27 days. Many juveniles left their mother before a second clutch was released onto her mud whip, indicating that factors other than the appearance of a second clutch limit the duration of care for the first clutch of juveniles. Juvenile L. pinguis left the burrow of their mother in distinct batches, usually after a molting event. Some juveniles remained in the burrow of their mother for 40-60 days. Juvenile C. bigelowi commonly remained in the burrow of their mother for ≥80 days, and departed over a period that lasted 20-40 days until all juveniles had left. A literature review revealed that in many epibenthic peracarids with extended parental care, juveniles usually remain with their mothers for about 3 weeks. Females of species that carry their offspring during parental care usually do not produce a second brood while carrying one brood, whereas females that do not carry but guard their offspring often produce a second brood while caring for the first brood. Duration of extended parental care is much more variable in tube-/burrow-dwelling species, lasting from minutes in some species up to 3 months in others. It is concluded that tube-/burrow-dwelling species have a higher potential for long-tasting (≥≥20 days) extended parental care than epibenthic species. Ecological constraints, such as availability of space and food, predation, disturbance, and competition, are discussed as factors limiting the duration of extended parental care. It is hypothesized that the potential for extended parental care is high in marine peracarids, but advanced social behavior is restricted to species that are living in dwellings of biotic origin.",,"Thiel, Martin",1999,10.2307/1549547,0,408
433,Extended parental care in marine amphipods. I. Juvenile survival without parents,"Extended parental care is found among a variety of marine peracarid species including endobenthic and epibenthic amphipods. After hatching from the female's brood pouch, small juveniles enjoy parental care for time periods of several days up to several weeks. This study examined whether small juvenile amphipods can survive without parental care to determine if this reproductive strategy is obligate or facultative. Juveniles of the burrow-dwelling species Leptocheirus pinguis (Stimpson 1853) and Casco bigelowi (Blake 1929) survived well in predator-free trays, indicating that extended parental care in these species is a facultative reproductive strategy juveniles can survive without their parents. Medium-sized juveniles of the epibenthic, suspension-feeding species Dyopedos monacanthus (Metzger 1875) survived relatively well in predator-free traps, but small juvenile D. monacanthus did not. This low survival rate of small D. monacanthus, even in predator-free trays, demonstrates that extended parental care is obligate for the survival of early juvenile stages in this epibenthic amphipod. When exposed to predators, juveniles of all three amphipod species were susceptible to predation, and reacted by emigration. Most juvenile L. pinguis and C. bigelowi emigrated or disappeared from sand shrimp Crangon septemspinosa treatments, but many remained in hermit crab Pagurus longicarpus treatments. Almost all juvenile D. monacanthus emigrated from both sand shrimp and hermit crab treatments, indicating that this epibenthic amphipod species is very susceptible to epibenthic predation. Survival of juvenile D. monacanthus was lower than that of L. pinguis and C. bigelowi both in predator-free and in predator trays. These results suggest that juveniles of this and other epibenthic peracarids depend on maternal care to a higher degree than juveniles of endobenthic burrow-dwelling species.",Amphipoda; Extended parental care; Predation; Reproduction; Soft-bottom,"Thiel, Martin",1998,10.1016/S0022-0981(97)00268-2,0,409
434,Reproductive biology of an epibenthic amphipod (Dyopedos monacanthus) with extended parental care,"Dyopedos monacanthus inhabits self-constructed mud whips on marine soft-bottoms. Juveniles stay on the mud whip of their mother for extended time periods after they hatch from her brood pouch. During the main reproductive period in the spring, parental females have been observed in the aquarium and collected from the field. Specimens of D. monacanthus have been collected simultaneously from the intake filter from the sea-water laboratory. Several consecutive clutches have been found on the whip of one female. Most juveniles are small (1 mm in size), but they grow to sizes of >2 mm on the whip of their mother. In the aquarium, juveniles usually hatched immediately after the females had been attended by males. They then clung to their mother's whip for about two weeks. Most parental females in the aquarium produced three broods during a time period of about six weeks. In the field an average of 36 parental females m-2 were found in April, and an average number of 75 juveniles clung to each female's whip. The average number of juveniles found on the females' whips declined in May and June. Many juveniles appeared in the sea-water intake filter starting in mid April. Most juveniles caught in the intake filter were between 2 and 3 mm in size which corresponds well with their size at leaving the female's whip. In mid May, all amphipods disappeared within a few days from the aquarium, when shrimp Crangon septemspinosa started to become more active again. Many big females disappeared in the field at that time too, and in mid June parental females were smaller than in the previous months. The amphipod D. monacanthus belongs in the category of epibenthic suspension-feeding amphipods. It is probably very susceptible to epibenthic predation and extended parental care is primarily a mechanism to lift very small juveniles above the viscous sublayer in the benthic boundary layer.",,"Thiel, Martin",1997,10.1017/s0025315400038625,0,410
435,Protected health information on social networking sites: Ethical and legal considerations,"Background: Social networking site use is increasingly common among emerging medical professionals, with medical schools even reporting disciplinary student expulsion. Medical professionals who use social networking sites have unique responsibilities since their postings could violate patient privacy. However, it is unknown whether students and residents portray protected health information and under what circumstances or contexts. Objective: The objective of our study was to document and describe online portrayals of potential patient privacy violations in the Facebook profiles of medical students and residents. Methods: A multidisciplinary team performed two cross-sectional analyses at the University of Florida in 2007 and 2009 of all medical students and residents to see who had Facebook profiles. For each identified profile, we manually scanned the entire profile for any textual or photographic representations of protected health information, such as portrayals of people, names, dates, or descriptions of procedures. Results: Almost half of all eligible students and residents had Facebook profiles (49.8%, or n=1023 out of 2053). There were 12 instances of potential patient violations, in which students and residents posted photographs of care they provided to individuals. No resident or student posted any identifiable patient information or likeness in text form. Each instance occurred in developing countries on apparent medical mission trips. These portrayals increased over time (1 in the 2007 cohort; 11 in 2009; P = .03). Medical students were more likely to have these potential violations on their profiles than residents (11 vs 1, P = .04), and there was no difference by gender. Photographs included trainees interacting with identifiable patients, all children, or performing medical examinations or procedures such as vaccinations of children. Conclusions: While students and residents in this study are posting photographs that are potentially violations of patient privacy, they only seem to make this lapse in the setting of medical mission trips. Trainees need to learn to equate standards of patient privacy in all medical contexts using both legal and ethical arguments to maintain the highest professional principles. We propose three practical guidelines. First, there should be a legal resource for physicians traveling on medical mission trips such as an online list of local laws, or a telephone legal contact. Second, institutions that organize medical mission trips should plan an ethics seminar prior the departure on any trip since the legal and ethical implications may not be intuitive. Finally, at minimum, traveling physicians should apply the strictest legal precedent to any situation.",Internet; Medical missions; Protected health information,"Thompson, Lindsay A.; Black, Erik; Duff, W.

436,Eliminating catheter-associated urinary tract infections in the intensive care unit: Is it an attainable goal?,"Background Purpose of this study is to determine strategies to decrease catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Methods ICU patients with an indwelling urinary catheter (UC) in one tertiary hospital were monitored for CAUTI. Interventions were implemented sequentially with quarterly data collection. Outcome measures were infection ratio (IR = number of infections/catheter days [CD] × 1000) and device utilization rate (DUR = catheter days/patient days). Results CDs and DUR decreased (fiscal year 2008: CD, 11,414; DUR,.85 vs fiscal year 2013: CD, 8,144; DUR,.70). IR increased with suspension of prepackaged baths (IR, 3.2 to 3.5 to 4.9 to 5.0), twice daily UC care (IR, 4.8 to 6.7), emptying UC bags at 400 mL (IR, 6.7 to 9.2). Two-person UC placement (IR, 5.6 to 4.8), physician notification of CAUTI (IR, 6.1 to 4.8), and reinstitution of prepackaged baths and daily UC care (IR, 4.8 to 3.7) decreased CAUTI rates. Conclusions Decreasing CAUTI in the ICU requires diligent monitoring and constant practice re-evaluation.

437,Comparison of Once-Daily Bromfenac 0.07% Versus Once-Daily Nepafenac 0.3% in Patients Undergoing Phacoemulsification,"Aim: Randomized pilot study comparing clinical outcomes with bromfenac ophthalmic solution 0.07% versus nepafenac 0.3% ophthalmic suspension administered as identical dosing regimens in patients undergoing uncomplicated phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation. Methods: Forty-nine subjects were treated with bromfenac (n = 25) or nepafenac (n = 24) once daily starting 3 days before cataract surgery, continued on the day of surgery, and for 21 days following surgery, in addition to standard of care. Subjects were followed at 1 day and 7, 21, and 42 days postoperatively. Assessments included best-corrected visual acuity [Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)], summed ocular inflammation score (SOIS; anterior chamber cells plus flare grading), macular volume and thickness (spectral domain optical coherence tomography), intraocular pressure, and adverse events. Results: Treatment groups were similar at baseline. Outcomes for mean letters read (p = 0.20), mean change in macular volume (p = 0.98), and retinal thickness (p = 0.93) were not statistically different between the groups at day 42. Mean SOIS dropped markedly and similarly from post-surgical day 1 to day 7 in both treatment groups and was statistically equivalent to baseline in both groups by day 21. At day 42, 87% of subjects in the bromfenac group and 82% of subjects in the nepafenac group demonstrated stable or improved visual acuity. The proportions of eyes with mean retinal thickness of 10 µm or less at days 7, 21, and 42 were similar for the bromfenac (95.8%, 78.3%, 73.9%, respectively) and nepafenac (91.7%, 87.5%, 66.7%) groups (all p = NS, bromfenac vs. nepafenac). Conclusion: Both bromfenac 0.07% and nepafenac 0.3% produced positive and similar clinical outcomes with regard to ETDRS visual acuity post-cataract surgery when dosed using identical regimens. Increases in mean retinal thickness and mean macular volume were small and similar between treatments. Trial Registration number: NCT01847638.

438,Monitoring inbaskets with feedback to providers enhances the timeliness of patient care,"Purpose Electronic health records have changed providers’ workflow. Epic’s InBasket supplants traditional communication and is a central hub for clinical information. Failure to promptly complete records impairs communication and revenue collection. By tracking providers’ InBasket activities and offering feedback, we hoped to improve InBasket management and interdisciplinary communication. Methods We created a report to track 273 providers’ InBasket activities, including ambulatory transcriptions, chart cosignatures, order cosignatures, patient calls, results, and billable encounters. The report showed how often and for how long each activity was delinquent. We completed three Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. During cycle 1 (November to December 2015), we sent all providers automated e-mails with their monthly results. During cycle 2 (January to April 2016), we focused solely on billable encounter closure and sent targeted e-mails to providers with . 50 delinquent encounters. The e-mails stated that providers had 30 days to complete encounters or their practices would be closed to new patients; at 30 days, noncompliant providers had 60 days before practice suspension. During cycle 3 (May to September 2016), we continued to monitor and send targeted e-mails to providers who accumulated . 50 encounters. We modeled the financial impact of the intervention using net closure data, the report’s aging function, and billing logs. Results InBasket monitoring with structured feedback decreased open encounters by 53.43%. We did not see improvements in the other metrics that the report tracked. We estimate that $231,724 was saved as a result of the intervention and $349,179 was lost to filing deadlines. Conclusion Automated e-mails did not reduce open encounters; targeted e-mails to providers improved InBasket management.",,"Trant, Amelia A.; Strait, Michael; Kaplan, Rory; Dest, Vanna; Roshka, Adam; Lyons, Catherine A.; Vest, Kevin A.; Steffen, Tessa; Chiang, Anne; Adelson, Kerin B.",2018,10.1200/JOP.17.00103,0,414
439,Predictors and consequences of prescription drug misuse during middle school,"Objectives: Non-medical prescription drug use (NMPDU) is a growing public health problem among adolescents. This is the first study to examine the correlates of early NMPDU initiation during middle school, and how early initiation is associated with four domains of functioning in high school (mental health, social, academic, and delinquency). Methods: Students initially in 6th-8th grades from 16 middle schools completed in-school surveys between 2008 and 2011 (Waves 1-5), and a web-based survey in 2013-2014 (Wave 6). We used discrete time survival analysis to assess predictors of initiation from Waves 1 to 5 based on students who provided NMPDU information at any of these waves (n= 12,904), and regression analysis to examine high school outcomes associated with initiation based on a sample that was followed into high school, Wave 6 (n= 2539). Results: Low resistance self-efficacy, family substance use, low parental respect, and offers of other substances from peers were consistently associated with NMPDU initiation throughout middle school. Further, perceiving that more of one's peers engaged in other substance use was associated with initiation at Wave 1 only. By high school, those students who initiated NMPDU during middle school reported lower social functioning, and more suspensions and fighting, compared to students who did not initiate NMPDU during middle school. Conclusion: NMPDU initiation during middle school is associated with poorer social functioning and greater delinquency in high school. It is important for middle school prevention programs to address NMPDU. Such programs should focus on both family and peer influences, as well as strengthening resistance self-efficacy.",Adolescents; Longitudinal; Initiation; Non-medical prescription drug use,"Tucker, Joan S.; Ewing, Brett A.; Miles, Jeremy N.V.; Shih, Regina A.; Pedersen, Eric R.; D'Amico, Elizabeth J.",2015,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.09.018,0,415
440,Examining the changing influence of predictors on adolescent alcohol misuse,"The purpose of this study was to examine whether the influence of key characteristics on adolescent alcohol misuse (i.e., maternal binge drinking, parenting, peers, school characteristics, and the adolescent's own behavior) change over time and whether predictors of adolescent alcohol misuse vary by gender and race/ethnicity. Using prospective, longitudinal data from a community sample, results revealed that mother's binge drinking, peer drinking, and an early age of onset predicted higher levels of alcohol misuse when respondents were 14-16 years of age. Two years later, when adolescents were 16-18 years of age, maternal binge drinking was no longer significant, however, maternal attachment, school attachment, peer drinking, and early age of onset were found to significantly predict adolescent alcohol misuse. Race differences were found for maternal binge drinking and gender differences were found for school suspension and maternal monitoring on adolescent drinking. © Copyright (c) by The Haworth Press, Inc.

As such, the current study uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to examine predictors of running away among a diverse sample of housed adolescents ages 12 through 13. Results indicate that socioeconomic status, being African American or Hispanic, and monitoring were significantly predictive of a decrease in the mean rate of running away in midadolescence. In contrast, being female, neighborhood victimization, personal victimization, school suspension, and delinquency all significantly increased the expected frequency of running away. Although findings provide some support for previous cross-sectional studies, they also point to the importance of young people's community environment as a risk factor for leaving home. © 2008 Sage Publications.",Adolescents; Risk factors; Running away,"Tyler, Kimberly A.; Bersani, Bianca E.",2008,10.1177/0272431607313592,0,417

The participant, JB, was a 4-year-old boy whose noncompliance and aggressive behavior put him at risk for behavioral disorders and expulsion from his childcare center. The study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involved an assessment that included structured interviews and observations, hypothesis development, and hypothesis testing within the context of typically occurring routines and activities in the childcare. Phase 2 consisted of an assessment-based intervention that was implemented by the childcare staff. The intervention immediately reduced JB's noncompliance and aggressive behavior. These gains were maintained throughout the study and received high acceptability ratings from the staff who carried out the treatment. Implications are presented regarding the efficacy of interventions based on data gained through structural analyses of problem behavior to prevent the development of behavioral disorders.",,"Umbreit, John; Blair, Kwang Sun",1996,10.1177/019874299702200206,1,418
443,"Nebulized budesonide added to standard pediatric emergency department treatment of acute asthma: A randomized, double-blind trial","Objectives: The goal was to determine if adding inhaled budesonide to standard asthma therapy improves outcomes of pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute asthma. Methods: The authors conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a tertiary care, urban pediatric ED. Patients 2 to 18 years of age with moderate to severe acute asthma were randomized to receive either a single 2-mg dose of budesonide inhalation suspension (BUD) or normal sterile saline (NSS) placebo, added to albuterol, ipratropium bromide (IB), and systemic corticosteroids (SCS). The primary outcome was the difference in median asthma scores between treatment groups at 2 hours. Secondary outcomes included differences in vital signs and hospitalization rates. Results: A total of 180 patients were enrolled. Treatment groups had similar baseline demographics, asthma scores, and vital signs. A total of 169 patients (88 BUD, 81 NSS) were assessed for the primary outcome. No significant difference was found between groups in the change in median asthma score at 2 hours (BUD -3, NSS -3, p = 0.64). Vital signs at 2 hours were also similar between groups. Fifty-six children (62%) were admitted to the hospital in the BUD group and 55 (62%) in the NSS group (difference 0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -14% to 14%). Neither multivariate adjustment nor planned subgroup analysis by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) use prior to the ED significantly altered the results. Conclusions: For children 2 to 18 years of age treated in the ED for acute asthma, a single 2-mg dose of budesonide added to standard therapy did not improve asthma severity scores or other short-term ED-based outcomes. © 2011 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.",,"Upham, Bryan D.; Mollen, Cynthia J.; Scarfone, Richard J.; Seiden, Jeffrey; Chew, Amber; Zorc, Joseph J.",2011,10.1111/j.1553-2712.2011.01114.x,0,419
444,A pilot study of early childhood mental health consultation for children with behavioral problems in preschool,"This study reports the findings of a pilot demonstration project called Together for Kids, which used a mental health consultation model to address the needs of young children with challenging behaviors who are identified in preschool classrooms. The study was conducted in four preschool programs and one Head Start program serving children ages 3-5, including both private-pay families and those using public subsidies. Rates of significant behavior problems as assessed by preschool teachers using a standardized scale were high, with 34% of all children enrolled in preschool classrooms in these sites over a 3-year period identified at-risk of externalizing or internalizing problems. Classroom teachers, as well as individual children and families identified as at-risk, were provided services, including, classroom observation and teacher training, individual child assessment and therapy, family assessment and support, and referrals for other family needs. Analysis of outcomes for 47 children and families with externalizing behavior problems who received individualized consultation, compared to 89 control children, and analysis of outcomes of a matched group of 19 intervention and 19 control children, revealed that the intervention was associated with significant improvements in classroom aggressive and maladaptive behavior, and growth in adaptive behavior. Improvements in child behavior were associated with total hours of individual child services provided, and with improvements in child developmental skills. Significant reductions in the rate of children suspended or terminated from child care programs were also found. Implications for further development of models of early childhood mental health consultation are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

445,Cost-effectiveness of treatment of acute otorrhea in children with tympanostomy tubes,"BACKGROUND: Acute otorrhea is a common problem in children with tympanostomy tubes. We recently demonstrated that treatment with antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops is clinically superior to oral antibiotics and initial observation. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of these three common treatment strategies for this condition. METHODS: We performed an open-label pragmatic trial in which 230 children with acute uncomplicated tympanostomy-tube otorrhea were randomly allocated to receive 1 of 3 treatments: hydrocortisone-bacitracin-colistin eardrops, oral amoxicillin-clavulanate suspension, and initial observation (no assigned medication prescription to fill). Parents kept a daily diary capturing ear-related symptoms, health care resource use, and non-health care costs for 6 months. At 2 weeks and 6 months, the study doctor visited the children at home performing otoscopy. Using a societal perspective, treatment failure (otoscopic presence of otorrhea at 2 weeks) and number of days with otorrhea as reported in the daily diary were balanced against the costs. RESULTS: Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops were clinically superior to oral antibiotics and initial observation both at 2 weeks and 6 months. At 2 weeks, mean total cost per patient was US $42.43 for antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops, US$70.60 for oral antibiotics, and US$82.03 for initial observation. At 6 months, mean total cost per patient was US$368.20, US$420.73, and US$640.44, respectively. Because of the dominance of eardrops, calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios was redundant. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic-glucocorticoid eardrops are clinically superior and cost less than oral antibiotics and initial observation in children with tympanostomy tubes who develop otorrhea.",,"Van Dongen, Thijs M.A.; Schilder, Anne G.M.; Venekamp, Roderick P.; De Wit, G.

447,Maturational changes in anterior cingulate and frontoparietal recruitment support the development of error processing and inhibitory control,"Documenting the development of the functional anatomy underlying error processing is critically important for understanding age-related improvements in cognitive performance. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine time courses of brain activity in 77 individuals aged 8-27 years during correct and incorrect performance of an oculomotor task requiring inhibitory control. Canonical eye-movement regions showed increased activity for correct versus error trials but no differences between children, adolescents and young adults, suggesting that core task processes are in place early in development. Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was a central focus. In rostral ACC all age groups showed significant deactivation during correct but not error trials, consistent with the proposal that such deactivation reflects suspension of a ""default mode"" necessary for effective controlled performance. In contrast, dorsal ACC showed increased and extended modulation for error versus correct trials in adults, which, in children and adolescents, was significantly attenuated. Further, younger age groups showed reduced activity in posterior attentional regions, relying instead on increased recruitment of regions within prefrontal cortex. This work suggests that functional changes in dorsal ACC associated with error regulation and error-feedback utilization, coupled with changes in the recruitment of ""long-range"" attentional networks, underlie age-related improvements in performance. © The Author 2008.

448,One State’s Systems Change Efforts to Reduce Child Care Expulsion: Taking the Pyramid Model to Scale,"This article describes the efforts funded by the state of Colorado to address unacceptably high rates of expulsion from child care. Based on the results of a 2006 survey, the state of Colorado launched two complementary policy initiatives in 2009 to impact expulsion rates and to improve the use of evidence-based practices related to challenging behavior. The primary policy initiative involved the funding of a center to develop model sites, a state-level planning team, ongoing practitioner training, and certification of coaches and trainers all built around the Pyramid Model. The secondary initiative involved expanding the number of early childhood mental health consultants and modifying their reimbursement/payment formula such that direct preventative work with adult providers, consistent with the Pyramid Model, was reimbursable. A follow-up survey in 2011 showed a dramatic reduction in expulsion rates and a corollary increase in providers’ teaching of prosocial skills to children with challenging behavior.",classroom; prevention; evidence-based practices; expulsion; behavior; policy issues; scaling up,"Vinh, Megan; Strain, Phil; Davidon, Sarah; Smith, Barbara J.",2016,10.1177/0271121415626130,1,423
449,Comparison of fluconazole and nystatin oral suspensions for prophylaxis of systemic fungal infection in very low birthweight infants,"We compared the efficacy and safety of fluconazole and nystatin oral suspensions for the prevention of systemic fungal infection (SFI) in very low birthweight infants. A prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted over a 15-month period, from May 1997 through September 1998, in 80 preterm infants with birthweights <1500 g. The infants were randomly assigned to receive oral fluconazole or nystatin, beginning within the first week of life. Prophylaxis was continued until full oral feedings were attained. Blood and urine cultures were obtained at enrollment and then weekly thereafter. Thirty-eight infants were randomly assigned to receive oral fluconazole (group I), and 42 infants were assigned to receive nystatin (group II). Birthweight, gestational age, and risk factors for fungal colonization and SFI at the time of randomization and during the hospital course were similar in both groups. SFI developed in two infants (5.3%) in group I and six infants (14.3%) in group II. The difference between these two rates was not statistically significant (relative risk, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 1.72). There were no deaths in group I and six deaths in group II (p=0.03). Two infants died of neonatal sepsis, and four deaths were related to necrotizing enterocolitis and/or spontaneous intestinal perforation. No deaths were due to SFI. Enrollment was halted before completion and the study did not attain adequate power to detect a hypothesized drop in SFI rate from 15 to 5%. Although the results cannot justify any conclusion about the relative efficacy of fluconazole versus nystatin in prevention of SFI, the significantly higher mortality rate in the nystatin group raises questions about the relative safety of this medication.",Fluconazole; Fungal infections; Nystatin; Very low birthweight infants,"Violaris, Kimon; Carbone, Tracy; Bateman, David; Olawepo, Olajide; Doraiswamy, Brinda; Lacorte, Meena",2010,10.1055/s-0029-1224871,0,424
450,Modified-bolus placement as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of pediatric feeding disorders: Analysis from a retrospective chart review,"Purpose: Recognizing the need to advance the treatment of pediatric feeding disorders, an emerging area of inquiry focuses on therapeutic techniques that address expulsion and packing possibly associated with oral-motor dysfunction. In the current study, we documented the use of modifiedbolus placement in the treatment of pediatric feeding disorders at an intensive, multidisciplinary day-treatment center over a 26-month period. Method: The retrospective observational cohort study involved patients admitted for the assessment and treatment of chronic food refusal from August 2013 to October 2015. Results: Patients (n = 23) who received modified bolus placement displayed moderate-to-severe oral-motor deficits. Use of modified-bolus placement was associated with reduced expulsion and packing of bites during meals, and treatment gains coincided with a threefold increase in grams consumed per meal. Conclusion: Results provide additional support for the potential therapeutic benefits of enhancing bolus placement onto the tongue as a means to improve mealtime performance in children with pediatric feeding disorders when included as an adjunct to more traditional behavioral approaches.",,"Volkert, Valerie M.; Sharp, William G.; Clark, Michele Cole; Ormand, Hailey; Rubio, Emily Kate; McCracken, Courtney; Bryan, Leah",2019,10.1044/2019_JSLHR-S-18-0268,0,425
451,Cytogenetic and molecular-cytogenetic studies of Rett syndrome (RTT): A retrospective analysis of a Russian cohort of RTT patients (the investigation of 57 girls and three boys),"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with an incidence of 2.5% in mentally retarded girls in Russia. We have performed cytogenetic studies of 60 patients (57 girls and three boys) with a clinical picture of RTT, selected according to the criteria for diagnosis of RTT defined by B. Hagberg et al. in 1996. Collection of DNA samples and fixed cell suspensions of RTT patients (37 girls and two boys) and their parents (27 patients) was established for molecular studies, for example analysis of MECP2 mutations in a Russian cohort of RTT patients. Among 60 patients 57 girls with a clinical picture of RTT had normal female karyotype (46,XX), one boy had normal male karyotype in peripheral lymphocytes (46,XY) and two boys had a mosaic form of Kleinfelter's syndrome (47,XXY/46,XY) in peripheral lymphocytes or muscle cells (with MeCP2 mutation R270X). Twenty-four mothers and parents of RTT girls had normal karyotype, two mothers had mosaic forms of Turner syndrome (45,X/46,XX) and one had mosaic karyotype (47,XX,+mar/48,XXX,+mar). We analyzed chromosome X in lymphocytes of 57 affected girls with a clinical picture of RTT using the 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine+Giemsa staining technique. A specific type of inactive chromosome X (so-called type 'C') with unusual staining of chromatin in the long arm of chromosome X was found in 55 (from 57) girls with RTT. This technique was positively used for presymptomatic diagnosis of RTT in five girls in earlier stages of the disease. We believe that the phenomenon of altered chromatin conformation in inactive chromosome X could be used as a laboratory test for preclinical diagnosis of the RTT.

452,"Ketone production in children with type 1 diabetes, ages 4–14 years, with and without nocturnal insulin pump suspension","Objective: To compare the frequency of elevated morning blood ketone levels according to age in 4–14 year olds with type 1 diabetes following overnight use of an automated low glucose insulin suspension system, or following control nights when the system was not used. Research design and methods: For 28 children ages 4–9 years and 54 youth ages 10–14 years, elevation of morning blood ketone levels was assessed using the Precision Xtra Ketone meter following 1155 and 2345 nights, respectively. Repeated measures logistic regression models were used to compare age groups for blood ketone level elevation following control nights (system not activated) and following intervention nights with and without insulin suspension. Results: Elevated morning blood ketones (≥0.6 mmol/L) were present following 10% of 580 control nights in the 4–9 year olds compared with 2% of 1162 control nights in 10–14 year olds (P < 0.001). Likewise, the frequency was greater following intervention nights in the younger age group (13% of 575 nights vs 2% of 1183 nights, P < 0.001). A longer duration of pump suspension resulted in a higher percentage of mornings with elevated blood ketones in the younger age group (P = 0.002), but not in the older age group (P = 0.63). The presence of elevated morning ketone levels did not progress to ketoacidosis in any subject. Conclusions: Elevated morning blood ketones are more common in younger children with type 1 diabetes with or without nocturnal insulin suspension.

453,Use of Compounded Dextromethorphan-Quinidine Suspension for Pseudobulbar Affect in Hospice Patients,"Background: Pseudobulbar affect (PBA) consists of unprovoked and uncontrollable episodes of laughing and/or crying. In end-of-life situations, PBA symptoms can be especially distressing to family and friends during an already heightened emotional time. Although a commercial product combining dextromethorphan and quinidine (DMQ) is FDA approved for use in PBA, many hospice patients are unable to swallow any solids or semisolids. An alternative formulation for these patients is needed. Objective: We present here two cases in which we used a compounded DMQ suspension successfully to treat PBA symptoms in the weeks before the patients' death. Design: A retrospective chart review was completed on the two cases where the DMQ suspension was used. A description of the DMQ suspension formula is described. Setting/Subjects: Both patients were under the care of a hospice program; one in home care and one in a skilled nursing facility. Measurements: Episodes of PBA symptoms were summarized in a narrative of the patients' symptom relief. Results: Both patients tolerated the administration of the DMQ suspension and there were noted improvements in PBA symptoms. Conclusions: DMQ suspension is an effective alternative for PBA symptoms in patients who cannot swallow oral solid medication.",dextromethorphan; pseudobulbar affect; quinidine,"Wahler, Robert G.; Reiman, Alfred T.; Schrader, Joshua V.",2017,10.1089/jpm.2016.0277,0,428

455,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, behavior regulation and virtual school support","CASE: Tony is a 6-year-old multiracial boy diagnosed as having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-combined type who is followed in your primary care practice and has started on a stimulant medication. Tony continues to have difficulty with emotion regulation and impulse control both at home and at school. He was asked to leave his private school soon after beginning first grade because of physical fighting, emotional outbursts, and arguing with teachers. His mother made the decision to enroll Tony in online virtual schooling for the remainder of the academic year, with the plan to transition back to traditional school for the next academic year. They have enrolled in a program that offers lessons online and sends materials to the home for the child to use to complete certain types of assignments (e.g., science experiments). Virtual schools are different from traditional home schooling because children receive their instruction from teachers online with parental assistance as opposed to parents being responsible for teaching all material. Tonys mother comes to your practice requesting assistance with setting up an appropriate school environment for her son at home, where she can monitor and support his academic progress. Tony is a bright child, with an Intelligence Quotient in the superior range. He has advanced academic skills, but he becomes dysregulated if he is told he is wrong or that he has answered a question incorrectly. For example, if he answered a question incorrectly in class, he would become verbally abusive toward his teacher and often have temper tantrums. This challenging behavior occurred daily at school and was one of the factors leading to his expulsion. The behavior had predated the introduction of stimulant medication and had remained consistent after he began medication. Tonys parents are highly educated, and both parents hold professional jobs with steady income. His parents have good command of typical behavior management strategies such as the use of rewards, time out, and behavioral contingencies to target noncompliance and temper tantrums. However, Tonys difficulty identifying and regulating his emotions leads to emotional outbursts and shutdowns that have thus far been unresponsive to standard behavior management techniques. Tony continued to have outbursts even when the behavior was ignored. His mother is concerned not only about his learning during the coming year but also about his social relationships and the family dynamic. Tonys outbursts cause significant disruption in the home and are a source of tension among parents and siblings. His mother is asking for advice on how to support his behavior better at home now that he will be spending his entire day there.

456,In-vitro antibacterial and anti-encrustation performance of silver-polytetrafluoroethylene nanocomposite coated urinary catheters,"Background: Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are among the most common hospital-acquired infections, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. A major reason for this is that urinary catheters are not yet capable of preventing CAUTIs. Aim: To develop an anti-infective urinary catheter. Methods: An efficient silver-polytetrafluoroethylene (Ag-PTFE) nanocomposite coating was deposited on whole silicone catheters, and two in-vitro bladder models were designed to test antibacterial (against Escherichia coli) and anti-encrustation (against Proteus mirabilis) performances. Each model was challenged with two different concentrations of bacterial suspension. Findings: Compared with uncoated catheters, coated catheters significantly inhibited bacterial migration and biofilm formation on the external catheter surfaces. The time to develop bacteriuria was an average of 1.8 days vs 4 days and 6 days vs 41 days when the urethral meatus was infected with 106 and 102 cells/mL, respectively. For anti-encrustation tests, the coated catheter significantly resisted encrustation, although it did not strongly inhibit the increases in bacterial density and urinary pH. The time to blockage, which was found to be independent of the initial bacterial concentration in the bladder, was extended from 36.2±1.1 h (uncoated) to 89.5±3.54 h (coated) following bacterial contamination with 103 cells/mL in the bladder. Moreover, the coated catheter exhibited excellent biocompatibility with L929 fibroblast cells. Conclusion: Ag-PTFE coated Foley catheters should undergo further clinical trials to determine their ability to prevent CAUTIs during catheterization.",Biofilm; Catheter-associated urinary tract infections; Encrustation; In-vitro bladder models; Silver-polytetrafluoroethylene nanocomposite coatings; Urinary catheter,"Wang, L.; Zhang, S.; Keatch, R.; Corner, G.; Nabi, G.; Murdoch, S.; Davidson, F.; Zhao, Q.",2019,10.1016/j.jhin.2019.02.012,0,431
457,Hurricane Katrina: A Longitudinal Study of the Achievement and Behavior of Displaced Students,"This study examined the achievement and behavior of Mississippi children displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The analysis disclosed differences in achievement and behavior between displaced and non displaced students. Those who were displaced by Hurricane Katrina had lower academic performance and were more likely to engage in negative behaviors than non displaced students. These gaps preexisted Katrina and, in most instances, did not change significantly during the first 2 years following the storm. However, rates of suspension and expulsion increased among these students, while rates of non promotion decreased.

458,Prevention of surface-to-human transmission of rotaviruses by treatment with disinfectant spray,"A model was developed to examine the effects of disinfectants on the transmission of infectious rotavirus from a dried surface to humans. The initial experiments were designed to find a method of preserving rotavirus infectivity during drying. Culture-adapted human rotavirus (CJN strain) was dried at room temperature in different organic suspensions, including fecal matter, several laboratory media, and nonfat dry milk (NDM). Recoveries of infectious virus were then compared. Fecal matter provided little protection in this study relative to distilled water, but the other suspensions were quite protective, especially NDM, which consistently allowed recoveries of >50%. When 103 focus-forming units of unpassaged CJN virus were dried in NDM and administered to subjects who licked the dried material, 100% (8 of 8) became infected. The effect of Lysol brand disinfectant spray (LDS) was next examined. Although NDM provided some protection against inactivation by LDS, spraying under conditions recommended by the manufacturer consistently caused the CJN virus titer to decrease >5 log10. Consumption of CJN virus (103 focus-forming units) sprayed with LDS caused no infection in 14 subjects, whereas 13 of 14 subjects who consumed the unsprayed virus became infected (P < 0.00001). The methods developed in this study could be used to test the effects of other disinfectants on the spread of infectious rotavirus from inanimate surfaces to humans.",,"Ward, R. L.; Bernstein, D.

Data were gathered from 49 parents who had school-aged children enrolled in grades K–12 regarding the manner in which they parent and their child’s school performance. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients and multiple regression modeling were used to analyze the data. Findings suggested that parent involvement, suspension, and homework completion significantly accounted for the variance explained in grade point average. Authoritativeness was positively and significantly related to both rational and irrational parenting beliefs. Irrational parenting beliefs were positively and significantly related to homework completion.

460,ADHD Symptomatology and Criminal Behavior During Adolescence: Exploring the Mediating Role of School Factors,"Prior research has shown that attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) relates to various negative outcomes in adolescence, including academic failure, behavioral problems at school, and criminal behavior. However, this line of research has generally failed to explore whether ADHD connects to criminal behavior through its effects on school factors. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), this study finds that a retrospective account of ADHD symptomatology during childhood and early adolescence predicts weakened school attachment, lower grades, and higher risks for both out-of-school suspension and crime. School attachment, grades, and out-of-school suspension have the expected effects on crime among females and males. Among females, these school factors mediate the effects of ADHD symptomatology on crime. The effect of ADHD symptomatology on crime among males remains significant when controlling for school factors.

463,"Survival, persistence, and isolation of the emerging multidrug-resistant pathogenic yeast Candida auris on a plastic health care surface","The emerging multidrug-resistant pathogenic yeast Candida auris represents a serious threat to global health. Unlike most other Candida species, this organism appears to be commonly transmitted within health care facilities and causes health care-associated outbreaks. To better understand the epidemiology of this emerging pathogen, we investigated the ability of C. auris to persist on plastic surfaces common in health care settings compared with that of Candida parapsilosis, a species known to colonize the skin and plastics. Specifically, we compiled comparative and quantitative data essential to understanding the vehicles of spread and the ability of both species to survive and persist on plastic surfaces under controlled conditions (25°C and 57% relative humidity), such as those found in health care settings. When a test suspension of 104 cells was applied and dried on plastic surfaces, C. auris remained viable for at least 14 days and C. parapsilosis for at least 28 days, as measured by CFU. However, survival measured by esterase activity was higher for C. auris than C. parapsilosis throughout the 28-day study. Given the notable length of time Candida species survive and persist outside their host, we developed methods to more effectively culture C. auris from patients and their environment. Using our enrichment protocol, public health laboratories and researchers can now readily isolate C. auris from complex microbial communities (such as patient skin, nasopharynx, and stool) as well as environmental biofilms, in order to better understand and prevent C. auris colonization and transmission.",Persistence; Public health; Candida; Candida auris; Candida parapsilosis; Clinical methods,"Welsh, Rory M.; Bentz, Meghan L.; Shams, Alicia; Houston, Hollis; Lyons, Amanda; Rose, Laura J.; Litvintseva, Anastasia P.",2017,10.1128/JCM.00921-17,0,436
464,Practical considerations when treating children with antimicrobials in the outpatient setting,"Over the past decade new antimicrobial agents have been introduced used to treat common paediatric infectious diseases such as acute otitis media and sinusitis. These agents vary with respect to their mechanism of action, dosage and duration of therapy, cost, taste and type of adverse effects. More recently, there has been concern about the overuse of antibiotics and increasing bacterial resistance, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, to these agents. Dosage and duration of therapy, cost, taste, and adverse effects play important roles in determining success or failure of antimicrobial medications in paediatric patients. Use of potential alternatives and adjuncts to antimicrobial treatment, such as vaccination, control of environmental risk factors, surgical techniques and alternative medical therapies may also be employed, and the practitioner must ascertain if their paediatric patients are being treated by any of these methods. Rather than listing the therapeutic challenges for all common outpatient paediatric infectious diseases, acute otitis media (accounting for over 50% of the antimicrobial prescriptions dispensed in childhood) is used to illustrate each issue. Clinicians are faced with a growing number of possible antimicrobial choices; concomitantly, there is increasing concern that these agents are overused. When prescribing antimicrobial agents, we need to be familiar with what we can do to optimise the care we provide. By avoiding inappropriate or trivial use of antimicrobials, we can preserve and even strengthen our armamentarium against disease. Simple strategies can improve compliance with therapeutic regimens and improve parental satisfaction.",,"Werk, Lloyd N.; Bauchner, Howard",1998,10.2165/00003495-199855060-00005,0,437

Methods: We utilized quantitative analysis, including rates and weighted risk ratios, to assess disproportionality in disciplinary exclusions in terms of suspensions and expulsions. Results: AI/AN students were disproportionately represented in exclusionary discipline practices, most substantially in comparison to White students, while AIAN students with disabilities were disproportionally represented in terms of suspension and expulsion risk compared to both Hispanic/Latino and White students, but not compared to Black students. The risk for AI/AN students, with and without disabilities, was highest for expulsion, the most extreme form of disciplinary exclusion. Conclusions: AI/AN students with and without disabilities remain overrepresented in exclusionary discipline. The Largest disproportionality was evident comparing AI/AN students and White students, with AI/AN students nearly nine times more likely to receive an in-school suspension, more than 10 times more likely to receive an out-of-school suspension, nearly 16 times more likely to receive more than one out-of-school suspension, and more than 30 times more likely to be expelled.

In the current investigation, we identified 4 children diagnosed with a feeding disorder who exhibited high rates of expulsion. Treatment with re-presentation (placing expelled liquids or solids back into the child's mouth) was not effective in reducing expulsion. Therefore, we added a chin-prompt procedure (the feeder applied gentle upward pressure to the child's chin and lower lip) for the initial presentation and the re-presentation. Chin prompt plus re-presentation resulted in low rates of expulsion for all 4 children.

One method of treating problem mealtime behavior is to implement interventions sequentially after the problem behavior emerges (e.g., Sevin, Gulotta, Sierp, Rosica, & Miller, 2002). Alternatively, interventions could target problem behavior in anticipation of its emergence. In the current study, we implemented nonremoval and re-presentation of bites either on a spoon or on a Nuk for 12 children with feeding problems. The nonremoval and re-presentation treatment improved feeding behavior for 8 of 12 children. Of those 8 children, 5 had lower levels of expulsions, and 4 of the 8 children had higher levels of mouth clean with the Nuk than with the spoon. We describe the subsequent clinical course of treatment and present follow-up data for 7 of the 8 children who responded to the nonremoval and re-presentation treatment with the spoon or Nuk.

(1) Evaluate the presentation, diagnostic workup, and outcomes of contemporary surgical intervention for airway obstruction from innominate artery tracheal compression in children. (2) Assess the significance of synchronous airway lesions in the treatment of innominate artery tracheal compression. Study Design. Case series with chart review. Setting. Tertiary care children's hospital. Methods. This study is a retrospective medical record review of 26 consecutive children who underwent aortopexy for innominate artery tracheal compression at a tertiary care children's hospital. Presenting symptoms, diagnostic workup, presence of synchronous airway lesions, length of hospitalization, and treatment outcomes were examined. Results. Twenty-six patients (17 male, 65%) were included in the study. All were diagnosed with bronchoscopy and confirmed with radiographic imaging. Median age at diagnosis and surgery was 9.7 and 10.0 months, respectively. Presenting symptoms included noisy breathing (93%), cough (78%), dyspnea (44%), apnea (44%), cyanosis (19%), and recurrent respiratory infections (15%). Average degree of tracheal compression was 71% (SD, 12%). Fifteen of 26 (58%) patients had synchronous airway lesions, including mild laryngomalacia and subglottic stenosis. Median length of stay was 2 days. Median follow-up was 10 months. Subjective improvement occurred in all 21 patients for whom follow-up information was available. Conclusion. Anterior tracheal vascular compression can cause a variety of airway symptoms. Mild synchronous airway lesions are common and do not prevent successful aortopexy.

471,"Selection into, and academic benefits from, arts-related courses in middle school among low-income, ethnically diverse youth.","It is critical for research on the effects of arts engagement to identify and carefully control for preexisting selection factors that differentiate those who do and do not get exposure to the arts. We prospectively followed a large and diverse sample of preschool children (n = 31,332; 61% Latino, 32% Black, 55% ELL, 81% free/reduced lunch) until they completed 6th, 7th, and/or 8th grade. School readiness was assessed during pre-K, and archival public-school data were collected in middle school. Overall, 40% of students took some kind of arts elective course (music, dance, drama, visual art) during middle school. Black students, males, students with disabilities, those previously retained, and those not English proficient had reduced odds of taking an arts class. Children with stronger school readiness skills at age 4 and stronger academics in 5th grade were more likely to enroll in arts-related courses. Importantly, controlling for prior variables associated with selection into the arts, including prior academic performance, students with exposure to an arts elective in middle school subsequently had significantly higher GPAs and math and reading scores, and decreased odds of school suspension, compared to students not exposed to the arts.

472,The artificial pancreas: Evaluating risk of hypoglycaemia following errors that can be expected with prolonged at-home use,"Aims: Artificial pancreas systems show benefit in closely monitored at-home studies, but may not have sufficient power to assess safety during infrequent, but expected, system or user errors. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of an artificial pancreas system emulating the β-cell when the glucose value used for control is improperly calibrated and participants forget to administer pre-meal insulin boluses. Methods: Artificial pancreas control was performed in a clinic research centre on three separate occasions each lasting from 10 p.m. to 2 p.m. Sensor glucose values normally used for artificial pancreas control were replaced with scaled blood glucose values calculated to be 20% lower than, equal to or 33% higher than the true blood glucose. Safe control was defined as blood glucose between 3.9 and 8.3 mmol/l. Results: Artificial pancreas control resulted in fasting scaled blood glucose values not different from target (6.67 mmol/l) at any scaling factor. Meal control with scaled blood glucose 33% higher than blood glucose resulted in supplemental carbohydrate to prevent hypoglycaemia in four of six participants during breakfast, and one participant during the night. In all instances, scaled blood glucose reported blood glucose as safe. Conclusions: Outpatient trials evaluating artificial pancreas performance based on sensor glucose may not detect hypoglycaemia when sensor glucose reads higher than blood glucose. Because these errors are expected to occur, in-hospital artificial pancreas studies using supplemental carbohydrate in anticipation of hypoglycaemia, which allow safety to be assessed in a controlled non-significant environment should be considered as an alternative. Inpatient studies provide a definitive alternative to model-based computer simulations and can be conducted in parallel with closely monitored outpatient artificial pancreas studies used to assess benefit.",,"Wolpert, H.; Kavanagh, M.; Atakov-Castillo, A.; Steil, G.

473,Childhood peer relationship problems and later risks of educational under-achievement and unemployment,"This paper examines relations between the extent of children's peer relationship problems at age 9 and their later risks of educational under-achievement and unemployment by the age of 18 years. Results showed that children with high rates of early peer relationship problems were at increased risk of under-achievement and unemployment when compared with children with low rates of early peer relationship problems. These elevated educational and occupational risks were explained by two processes. First, associations between early peer difficulties and later disadvantage were in part noncausal, and arose because of the personal characteristics (IQ and attentional problems) and social backgrounds (socioeconomic adversity, exposure to parental change, and punitive parent-child interaction) of children with early peer problems. Second, problematic peer relations during childhood appeared to place young people at increased risk of a range of adolescent interpersonal and school-related difficulties, including weaker peer attachments, interpersonal problems with teachers, school truancy, suspension, and early school leaving. In turn, these experiences and behaviours served to reduce the educational and employment opportunities of children with early peer problems. Results highlight the importance of childhood peer relationships for academic and occupational success.",Schizophrenia; Unemployment; Educational attainment; Child Behaviour Checklist; Longitudinal studies; Peer relationships,"Woodward, Lianne J.; Fergusson, David M.",2000,10.1017/S002196309900520X,0,446
474,Prior problem behavior accounts for the racial gap in school suspensions,"Purpose: A large body of empirical research finds a significant racial gap in the use of exclusionary school discipline with black students punished at rates disproportionate to whites. Furthermore, no variable or set of variables have yet to account for this discrepancy, inviting speculation that this association is caused by racial bias or racial antipathy. We investigate this link and the possibility that differential behavior may play a role. Methods: Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class (ECLS-K), the largest sample of school-aged children in the United States, we first replicate the results of prior studies. We then estimate a second model controlling for prior problem behavior. Results: Replicating prior studies, we first show a clear racial gap between black and white students in suspensions. However, in subsequent analyses the racial gap in suspensions was completely accounted for by a measure of the prior problem behavior of the student - a finding never before reported in the literature. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of early problem behaviors and suggest that the use of suspensions by teachers and administrators may not have been as racially biased as some scholars have argued. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Wright, John Paul; Morgan, Mark Alden; Coyne, Michelle A.; Beaver, Kevin M.; Barnes, J.

475,Antimicrobial activity of ozone and NaF-chlorhexidine on early childhood caries,"An early childhood carie (ECC) is an extremely destructive form of tooth decay. The aim of this study was to investigate the action of ozone (O3), and the association of sodium fluoride (NaF) with chlorhexidine (CHX) on bacteria related to ECC. Overnight culture of the bacteria was performed. On exponential phase the suspension was adjusted (101-108 CFU/mL). A drop (10μL) of each concentration of bacteria was applied on sheep blood agar plates and treated with O3 (2, 20, 200, and 2,000 ppm); after 18 hours, recovery analysis of CFU verified the reduction of bacterial activity. For NaF-CHX, sterile 96-well plates were prepared and divided into groups: G1 (150 μL TSB); G2 (20 μL of bacteria + 25 μL CHX + 25 μL NaF); and G3 (150 μL TSB + 20 μL of bacteria + 50 μL water). The plates were verified by analysis of the optical density (0, 12, 14, 16, and 18 hours). The data from O3 test were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey's test (p < 0.05). For the data from NaF-CHX, the ANOVA 2-way and Bonferroni's test (p < 0.05) were used. The number of CFU/mL showed death > 3log10 (99.9%) for all bacteria (ozone ≥ 20ppm), while the combination of NaF-CHX was more effective (p < 0.001) compared to each substance tested alone and the control group. The antimicrobial agents tested were able to inhibit all bacteria tested; O3 seemed to be a good alternative for controlling progression of carious lesions, while the association of NaF-CHX showed to be a good antimicrobial with easy and inexpensive application.",Chlorhexidine; Dental caries; Ozone; Sodium fluoride; Tooth deciduous,"Ximenes, Marcos; Cardoso, Mariane; Astorga, Fernando; Arnold, Roland; Pimenta, Luiz André; Viera, Ricardo de Sousa",2017,10.1590/1807-3107BOR-2017.vol31.0002,0,448
476,Predictors of early elementary school suspension by gender: A longitudinal multilevel analysis,"Despite the large body of work demonstrating the detrimental effects of school suspension, there are notable gaps in the research regarding predictors of this form of discipline in early elementary school, and particularly in how these predictors may vary by gender. This longitudinal study was designed to address these gaps by exploring kindergarten and first grade predictors of one and three years later school suspension. The final sample consisted of 3495 kindergarten and 1st grade elementary school students who were referred to a truancy program from 348 public schools. Multilevel logistic regressions were conducted to control for cluster effects of individual school on students’ suspension outcomes; findings indicate common and unique risk factors for suspension by gender. For both boys and girls, being Black and being rated by teachers as disruptive predicted future suspension. In addition, teacher-rated aggression for boys and lack of parental involvement for girls were significantly associated with a greater likelihood of suspension. Finally, a teacher's assessment of child behaviors in early elementary school predicted suspension in later. The findings highlight the potential of addressing the predictors of suspension in the early school years as one effective strategy to prevent future school suspension.",,"Yang, Mi Youn; Harmeyer, Erin; Chen, Zibei; Lofaso, Blaine Masinter",2018,10.1016/j.childyouth.2018.08.008,0,449
477,Efficacy of subdural saline injection during surgery for acute epidural haematomas,"Primary objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of subdural space saline injection surgery in the management of large acute epidural haematomas (EDHs). Methods and procedures: Over a period of 6 years, the authors employed the technique of subdural space saline injection to facilitate elevation of dura after evacuation of supratentorial epidural haematomas. Main outcomes and results: Eighty patients with supratentorial epidural haematomas underwent the procedure. Infusion of saline in the subdural space not only helps elevation of the dura, facilitate haemostasis and application of suspension stitches during operation, it also avoids ICP fluctuations during the operations. Post-operative CT scans showed rapid disappearance of saline and reposition of cerebral structure. No patient required re-operation for residual haematoma.

478,Development of an autologous canine cancer vaccine system for resectable malignant tumors in dogs,"While conventional therapies exist for canine cancer, immunotherapies need to be further explored and applied to the canine setting. We have developed an autologous cancer vaccine (K9-ACV), which is available for all dogs with resectable disease. K9-ACV was evaluated for safety and immunogenicity for a variety of cancer types in a cohort of companion dogs under veterinary care. The autologous vaccine was prepared by enzymatic digestion of solid tumor biopsies. The resultant single cell suspensions were then UV-irradiated resulting in immunogenic cell death of the tumor cells. Following sterility and endotoxin testing, the tumor cells were admixed with CpG ODN adjuvant and shipped to the participating veterinary clinics. The treating veterinarians then vaccinated each patient with three intradermal injections (10 million cells per dose) at 30-day intervals (one prime and two boost injections). In a cohort of 20 dogs completing the study, 17 dogs (85%) developed an augmented IgG response to autologous tumor antigens as demonstrated using western blot analysis of pre- and post-peripheral blood samples. We also report several dogs have lived beyond expected survival time based on previously published data. In summary, K9-ACV is an additional option to be considered for the treatment of dogs with resectable cancer.",Autologous; Cancer; Canine; Vaccine,"Yannelli, J. R.; Wouda, R.; Masterson, T.

479,Examining the Overlap in Internet Harassment and School Bullying: Implications for School Intervention,"Purpose: As more and more youth utilize the Internet, concern about Internet harassment and its consequences for adolescents is growing. This paper examines the potential overlap in online and school harassment, as well as the concurrence of Internet harassment and school behavior problems. Methods: The Growing Up with Media survey is a national cross-sectional online survey of 1588 youth between the ages of 10 and 15 years old. Our main measures were Internet harassment (i.e., rude or nasty comments, spreading of rumors, threatening or aggressive comments) and school functioning (i.e., academic performance; skipping school; detentions and suspensions; and carrying a weapon to school in the last 30 days). Results: Although some overlap existed, 64% of youth who were harassed online did not report also being bullied at school. Nonetheless, youth harassed online were significantly more likely to also report two or more detentions or suspensions, and skipping school in the previous year. Especially concerning, youth who reported being targeted by Internet harassment were eight times more likely than all other youth to concurrently report carrying a weapon to school in the past 30 days (odds ratio = 8.0, p = .002). Conclusions: Although the data do not support the assumption that many youth who are harassed online are bullied by the same (or even different) peers at school, findings support the need for professionals working with children and adolescents, especially those working in the schools, to be aware of the possible linkages between school behavior and online harassment for some youth. © 2007 Society for Adolescent Medicine.",Bullying; Victimization; Internet harassment; Psychosocial functioning; School health,"Ybarra, Michele L.; Diener-West, Marie; Leaf, Philip J.",2007,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.09.004,0,452
480,Effects of pushing techniques in birth on mother and fetus: A randomized study,"Background: The Valsalva pushing technique is used routinely in the second stage of labor in many countries, and it is accepted as standard obstetric management in Turkey. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of pushing techniques on mother and fetus in birth in this setting. Methods: This randomized study was conducted between July 2003 and June 2004 in Bakirkoy Maternity and Children's Teaching Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. One hundred low-risk primiparas between 38 and 42 weeks' gestation, who expected a spontaneous vaginal delivery, were randomized to either a spontaneous pushing group or a Valsalva-type pushing group. Spontaneous pushing women were informed during the first stage of labor about spontaneous pushing technique (open glottis pushing while breathing out) and were supported in pushing spontaneously in the second stage of labor. Similarly, Valsalva pushing women were informed during the first stage of labor about the Valsalva pushing technique (closed glottis pushing while holding their breath) and were supported in using Valsalva pushing in the second stage of labor. Perineal tears, postpartum hemorrhage, and hemoglobin levels were evaluated in mothers; and umbilical artery pH, Po2 (mmHg), and Pco2 (mmHg) levels and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes were evaluated in newborns in both groups. Results: No significant differences were found between the two groups in their demographics, incidence of nonreassuring fetal surveillance patterns, or use of oxytocin. The second stage of labor and duration of the expulsion phase were significantly longer with Valsalva-type pushing. Differences in the incidence of episiotomy, perineal tears, or postpartum hemorrhage were not significant between the groups. The baby fared better with spontaneous pushing, with higher 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, and higher umbilical cord pH and Po2 levels. After the birth, women expressed greater satisfaction with spontaneous pushing. Conclusions: Educating women about the spontaneous pushing technique in the first stage of labor and providing support for spontaneous pushing in the second stage result in a shorter second stage without interventions and in improved newborn outcomes. Women also stated that they pushed more effectively with the spontaneous pushing technique. © 2008, Copyright the Authors.",Experience of birth; Pushing techniques; Second stage of labor; Spontaneous pushing; Valsalva-type pushing,"Yildirim, Gulay; Beji, Nezihe Kizilkaya",2008,10.1111/j.1523-536X.2007.00208.x,0,453
481,Endoscopic management of congenital anterior glottic stenosis,"Introduction: Congenital anterior glottic stenosis (web) is a rare condition usually presenting with airway obstruction, stridor or dysphonia. Symptomatic infants may require tracheotomy to bridge the neonatal period. Early open surgical reconstruction may have significant risks and failure may still result in tracheotomy. We introduce an endoscopic surgical approach with balloon dilation for primary management of congenital anterior glottic stenosis. Methods: We present three cases of congenital anterior glottic stenosis in children 7, 14, and 90 days old presenting with stridor, dyspnea, and dysphonia. The larynx was exposed by suspension microlaryngoscopy. The glottic stenosis was incised from a posterior to anterior direction using a laryngeal sickle knife. Subsequently, an airway balloon was guided through the stenotic lumen. Once the balloon was inflated, the balloon pressure was maintained for 30. s or until the patient's oxygen saturation dropped below 92%. The dilation was repeated two or three times. The patients were kept intubated with an uncuffed endotracheal tube and monitored in the pediatric intensive care unit following surgery. Results: All three patients were extubated within 72. h without complications. One patient failed the first extubation attempt and was reintubated and successfully extubated 24. h later. Patients were re-evaluated with direct microlaryngoscopy within two weeks. All patients had symptomatic relief and did not require further surgical intervention. Conclusion: Endoscopic balloon dilation laryngoplasty may be a safe and effective primary procedure for pediatric patients with congenital anterior glottic stenosis. It is technically simple and obviates the potential morbidities associated with an open surgical procedure or tracheotomy.",Balloon; Dilation; Glottic; Glottis; Stenosis; Web,"Yoo, Mi Jin; Roy, Soham; Smith, Lee P.",2015,10.1016/j.ijporl.2015.09.013,0,454
482,"Black, White, and Hispanic Children's Health and Function 2-13 Months After Sibling Intensive Care Unit Death","Objective: To describe children's anxiety, depression, behaviors, and school performance at 2-13 months after sibling neonatal/pediatric intensive care unit (NICU/PICU) or emergency department (ED) death and compare these outcomes by child age, sex, race/ethnicity, whether the child saw their sibling in the NICU/PICU/ED, and attended the sibling's funeral. Study design: Children in 71 families were recruited for this longitudinal study from 4 children's hospitals and 14 other Florida hospitals. Children rated anxiety (Spence Children's Anxiety Scale) and depression (Children's Depression Inventory); parents rated child behaviors (Child Behavior Checklist) and reported school performance (detentions, suspensions, requested parent-teacher meetings) at 2, 4, 6, and 13 months post-sibling death. Analyses included repeated measures-ANOVA, t-tests, and 1-way ANOVA. Results: In total, 132 children and 96 parents participated. More children were female (58%), black (50%), and school-age (72%). Of the children, 43% had elevated anxiety and 6% had elevated depression over 13 months post-sibling death. Child-rated anxiety was higher for girls and black vs white children. Child-rated anxiety and depression were lower if they saw their sibling in the NICU/PICU/ED before and/or after the death, and/or attended the funeral. Teens were more withdrawn than school-age children at all time points. Children who did not see their deceased sibling in the NICU/PICU/ED after death had more requests for parent-teacher conferences. Conclusions: Children's anxiety was more common than depression, especially in girls and black children. Children who saw their siblings in the NICU/PICU/ED before/after death and/or attended funeral services had lower anxiety and depression over the first 13 months after sibling death.",child bereavement; child death; sibling bereavement; sibling death,"Youngblut, Jo Anne M.; Brooten, Dorothy; Del-Moral, Teresa; Cantwell, G.

484,Characterization of intratumor magnetic nanoparticle distribution and heating in a rat model of metastatic spine disease: Laboratory investigation,"Object. The goal of this study was to optimize local delivery of magnetic nanoparticles in a rat model of metastatic breast cancer in the spine for tumor hyperthermia while minimizing systemic exposure. Methods. A syngeneic mammary adenocarcinoma was implanted into the L-6 vertebral body of 69 female Fischer rats. Suspensions of 100-nm starch-coated iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH) were injected into tumors 9 or 13 days after implantation. For nanoparticle distribution studies, tissues were harvested from a cohort of 36 rats, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and histopathological studies with Prussian blue staining were used to analyze the samples. Intratumor heating was tested in 4 anesthetized animals with a 20-minute exposure to an alternating magnetic field (AMF) at a frequency of 150 kHz and an amplitude of 48 kA/m or 63.3 kA/m. Intratumor and rectal temperatures were measured, and functional assessments of AMF-exposed animals and histopathological studies of heated tumor samples were examined. Rectal temperatures alone were tested in a cohort of 29 rats during AMF exposure with or without nanoparticle administration. Animal studies were completed in accordance with the protocols of the University Animal Care and Use Committee. Results. Nanoparticles remained within the tumor mass within 3 hours of injection and migrated into the bone at 6, 12, and 24 hours. Subarachnoid accumulation of nanoparticles was noted at 48 hours. No evidence of lymphoreticular nanoparticle exposure was found on histological investigation or via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The mean intratumor temperatures were 43.2°C and 40.6°C on exposure to 63.3 kA/m and 48 kA/m, respectively, with histological evidence of necrosis. All animals were ambulatory at 24 hours after treatment with no evidence of neurological dysfunction. Conclusions. Locally delivered magnetic nanoparticles activated by an AMF can generate hyperthermia in spinal tumors without accumulating in the lymphoreticular system and without damaging the spinal cord, thereby limiting neurological dysfunction and minimizing systemic exposure. Magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia may be a viable option for palliative therapy of spinal tumors. ©AANS, 2014.",Rat; Hyperthermia; Iron oxide nanoparticles; Magnetic nanoparticles; Oncology; Spine; Tumor,"Zadnik, Patricia L.; Molina, Camilo A.; Sarabia-Estrada, Rachel; Groves, Mari L.; Wabler, Michele; Mihalic, Jana; McCarthy, Edward F.; Gokaslan, Ziya L.; Ivkov, Robert; Sciubba, Daniel M.",2014,10.3171/2014.2.SPINE13142,0,456

School engagement is potentially modifiable, and targeting engagement may be a means to improve education outcomes. Aims: To investigate school engagement for students with ADHD during the crucial high school transition period and to identify factors associated with low school engagement. Sample: Participants are adolescents (12–15 years) in the first and third year of high school with diagnosed ADHD (n = 130). Participants were recruited from 21 paediatric practices. Methods: Cross-sectional study assessing school engagement. Data were collected through direct assessment and child, parent, and teacher surveys. School engagement is measured as student attitudes to school (cognitive and emotional) and suspension rates (behavioural). Multivariable regression analyses examined student, family, and school factors affecting engagement. Results: In comparison with state data, students with ADHD in the first year of high school were less motivated (p <.01) and less connected to peers (p <.01). Overall, there was no discordance in third year attitudes. There were high rates of suspension in both years in comparison to state-wide suspensions (21% vs. 6%, p <.01). Explanatory factors for poor attitudes include adolescent depression, poor adolescent supervision, and devaluing education. Conduct problems and increased hyperactivity were related to increased likelihood of being suspended, whilst higher cognitive ability, family socio-economic status, and independent schools reduced risk. Conclusions: Potentially modifiable individual and family factors including adolescent depression, behavioural problems, education values, and family supervision could be targeted to better manage the high school transition for students with ADHD.",school engagement; attitudes; high school; adolescent; suspension; attention/deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Zendarski, Nardia; Sciberras, Emma; Mensah, Fiona; Hiscock, Harriet",2017,10.1111/bjep.12140,0,458
487,Adverse childhood experiences and preschool suspension expulsion: A population study,"Background: Preschool suspension and expulsion rates are typically based on teacher reports, and don't simultaneously account for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Objective: To examine estimates in the United States of parent-reported preschool suspension and expulsion rates, in the context of ACEs. Participants and setting: Parents of children aged 3–5 years old (N = 6,100) in the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health dataset. Method: We reported the prevalence estimates of preschool suspension and expulsion, and estimated the unique variance of ACEs as risk factors using weighted sequential logistic regression. Results: An estimated 174,309 preschoolers (2.0%) were suspended, and 17,248 (0.2%) children were expelled annually. If divided by 36 school weeks, the instances of weekly suspension and expulsion were at least 4,842 and 479 respectively. Controlling for previous risk factors (i.e., age, gender, race, ethnicity), the odds ratio increased by 80% for every unit of ACEs increment. Children were more likely to be suspended or expelled if they had domestic violence (OR = 10.6, p < .001), living with mental illness (OR = 9.8, p < .001), adult substance abuse (OR = 4.8, p < .001), and victim of violence (OR = 4.5, p = .004), living in high poverty (OR = 3.9, p = .001), divorced parents (OR = 3.3, p = .001), and parent incarceration (OR = 3.0, p = .009).

488,A Comparison of Medical Management with Misoprostol and Surgical Management for Early Pregnancy Failure,"BACKGROUND: Misoprostol is increasingly used to treat women who have a failed pregnancy in the first trimester. We assessed the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of this treatment in a large, randomized trial. METHODS: A total of 652 women with a first-trimester pregnancy failure (anembryonic gestation, embryonic or fetal death, or incomplete or inevitable spontaneous abortion) were randomly assigned to receive 800 μg of misoprostol vaginally or to undergo vacuum aspiration (standard of care) in a 3:1 ratio. The misoprostol group received treatment on day 1, a second dose on day 3 if expulsion was incomplete, and vacuum aspiration on day 8 if expulsion was still incomplete. Surgical treatment (for the misoprostol group) or repeated aspiration (for the vacuum-aspiration group) within 30 days after the initial treatment constituted treatment failure. RESULTS: Of the 491 women assigned to receive misoprostol, 71 percent had complete expulsion by day 3 and 84 percent by day 8 (95 percent confidence interval, 81 to 87 percent). Treatment failed in 16 percent of the misoprostol group and 3 percent of the surgical group (absolute difference, 12 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 16 percent) by day 30. Hemorrhage or endometritis requiring hospitalization was rare (1 percent or less in each group), with no significant differences between the groups. In the misoprostol group, 78 percent of the women stated that they would use misoprostol again if the need arose and 83 percent stated that they would recommend it to others. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of early pregnancy failure with 800 μg of misoprostol vaginally is a safe and acceptable approach, with a success rate of approximately 84 percent.

489,Epileptic discharges specifically affect intrinsic connectivity networks during absence seizures,"Intrinsic connectivity network (ICN) technique provides a feasible way for evaluating cognitive impairments in epilepsy. This EEG-fMRI study aims to comprehensively assess the alterations of ICNs affected by generalized spike-and-wave discharge (GSWD) during absence seizure (AS). Twelve fMRI sessions with GSWD, and individually paired non-GSWD sessions were acquired from 16 patients with AS. Ten ICNs corresponding to seizure origination and cognitive processes were extracted using independent component analysis. Intra- and inter-network connectivity alterations of the ICNs were observed through comparisons between GSWD and non-GSWD sessions. Sequential correlation analysis between GSWD and the ICN time courses addressed the immediate effects of GSWD on ICNs during AS. GSWD-related increase of intra-network connectivity was found only in the thalamus, and extensive decreases were found in the ICNs corresponding to higher-order cognitive processes including the default-mode network, dorsal attention network, central executive network and salience network. The perceptive networks and motor network were less affected by GSWD. Sequential correlation analysis further demonstrated different responses of the ICNs to GSWD. In addition to GSWD-related functional excitation in the thalamus and functional suspension in the default-mode network, this study revealed extensive inhibitions in the other ICNs corresponding to higher-order cognitive processes, and spared perceptive and motor processes in AS. GSWD elevated synchronization of brain network activity and sequentially affected the ICNs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

490,Effects of a physical and energetic challenge on male California mice (Peromyscus californicus): Modulation by reproductive condition,"Reproduction strongly influences metabolism, morphology and behavior in female mammals. In species in which males provide parental care, reproduction might have similar effects on fathers. We examined effects of an environmental challenge on metabolically important physiological, morphological and behavioral measures, and determined whether these effects differed between reproductive and non-reproductive males in the biparental California mouse (Peromyscus californicus). Males were paired with an ovary-intact female, an ovariectomized female treated with estrogen and progesterone to induce estrus, or an untreated ovariectomized female. Within each group, half of the animals were housed under standard laboratory conditions and half in cages requiring them to climb wire towers to obtain food and water; these latter animals were also fasted for 24 h every third day.We predicted that few differences would be observed between fathers and non-reproductive males under standard conditions, but that fathers would be in poorer condition than non-reproductive males under challenging conditions. Body and fat mass showed a housing condition-reproductive group interaction: the challenge condition increased body and fat mass in both groups of non-reproductive males, but breeding males were unaffected. Males housed under the physical and energetic challenge had higher blood lipid content, lower maximal aerobic capacity and related traits (hematocrit and relative triceps surae mass), increased pain sensitivity and increased number of fecal boli excreted during tail-suspension tests (a measure of anxiety), compared with controls. Thus, our physical and energetic challenge paradigm altered metabolism, morphology and behavior, but these effects were largely unaffected by reproductive condition.",Anxiety; Reproduction; Body composition; Fatherhood; Metabolism; Paternal care,"Zhao, Meng; Garland, Theodore; Chappell, Mark A.; Andrew, Jacob R.; Harris, Breanna N.; Saltzman, Wendy",2018,10.1242/jeb.168559,0,462
491,The Relationship between Resilience and Internet Addiction: A Multiple Mediation Model Through Peer Relationship and Depression,"Heavy use of the Internet may lead to profound academic problems in elementary students, such as poor grades, academic probation, and even expulsion from school. It is of great concern that Internet addiction problems in elementary school students have increased sharply in recent years. In this study, 58,756 elementary school students from the Henan province of China completed four questionnaires to explore the mechanisms of Internet addiction. The results showed that resilience was negatively correlated with Internet addiction. There were three mediational paths in the model: (a) the mediational path through peer relationship with an effect size of 50.0 percent, (b) the mediational path through depression with an effect size of 15.6 percent, (c) the mediational path through peer relationship and depression with an effect size of 13.7 percent. The total mediational effect size was 79.27 percent. The effect size through peer relationship was the strongest among the three mediation paths. The current findings suggest that resilience is a predictor of Internet addiction. Improving children's resilience (such as toughness, emotional control, and problem solving) can be an effective way to reduce Internet addiction behavior. The current findings provide useful information for early detection and intervention for Internet addiction.",depression; resilience; Internet addiction; peer relationship,"Zhou, Pingyan; Zhang, Cai; Liu, Jian; Wang, Zhe",2017,10.1089/cyber.2017.0319,0,463
492,"Changes in motor function, cognition, and emotion-related behavior after right hemispheric intracerebral hemorrhage in various brain regions of mouse","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a detrimental type of stroke. Mouse models of ICH, induced by collagenase or blood infusion, commonly target striatum, but not other brain sites such as ventricular system, cortex, and hippocampus. Few studies have systemically investigated brain damage and neurobehavioral deficits that develop in animal models of ICH in these areas of the right hemisphere. Therefore, we evaluated the brain damage and neurobehavioral dysfunction associated with right hemispheric ICH in ventricle, cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. The ICH model was induced by autologous whole blood or collagenase VII-S (0.075 units in 0.5 µl saline) injection. At different time points after ICH induction, mice were assessed for brain tissue damage and neurobehavioral deficits. Sham control mice were used for comparison. We found that ICH location influenced features of brain damage, microglia/macrophage activation, and behavioral deficits. Furthermore, the 24-point neurologic deficit scoring system was most sensitive for evaluating locomotor abnormalities in all four models, especially on days 1, 3, and 7 post-ICH. The wire-hanging test was useful for evaluating locomotor abnormalities in models of striatal, intraventricular, and cortical ICH. The cylinder test identified locomotor abnormalities only in the striatal ICH model. The novel object recognition test was effective for evaluating recognition memory dysfunction in all models except for striatal ICH. The tail suspension test, forced swim test, and sucrose preference test were effective for evaluating emotional abnormality in all four models but did not correlate with severity of brain damage. These results will help to inform future preclinical studies of ICH outcomes.",Cognition; Emotion; Intracerebral hemorrhage; Motor,"Zhu, Wei; Gao, Yufeng; Wan, Jieru; Lan, Xi; Han, Xiaoning; Zhu, Shanshan; Zang, Weidong; Chen, Xuemei; Ziai, Wendy; Hanley, Daniel F.; Russo, Scott J.; Jorge, Ricardo E.; Wang, Jian",2018,10.1016/j.bbi.2018.02.004,0,464
493,"Behavior problems, academic skill delays and school failure among school-aged children in foster care: Their relationship to placement characteristics","We describe the level of behavior problems, academic skill delays, and school failure among school-aged children in foster care. We also examine how behavior problems are associated with academic problems, and explore how these outcomes are related to children's placement characteristics. Foster parent and child home interviews, as well as teacher telephone interviews were conducted from a randomly selected sample of 302 children aged 6 through 12 years living in out-of-homeplacement. Interviews included standardized screening measures. Results showed that 27% of the children scored in the clinical range for a behavior problem, and 34% were rated as having at least one behavior problem in the classroom. Twenty-three percent of the children had severe delays in reading or math, 13% had repeated a grade, and 14% had a history of school suspension and/or expulsion. Behavior problems by foster parent report were related to child suspension and/or expulsion from school, but were not associated with severe academic delays or grade retention. Placement characteristics were only sometimes related to these outcomes. Future studies examining the mental health and educational needs of this population should take into account the child's sociodemographic and placement characteristics. © 2000 Human Sciences Press, Inc.",Behavior problems; Children; Foster care; Academic delays; School failure,"Zima, Bonnie T.; Bussing, Regina; Freeman, Stephanny; Yang, Xiaowei; Belin, Thomas R.; Forness, Steven R.",2000,10.1023/A:1009415800475,0,465
494,Utilizing social-emotional learning supports to address teacher stress and preschool expulsion,"Across the United States, rates of preschool expulsion exceed those in K-12 and relatively little is known of the antecedents and consequences of such disciplinary decisions for both teachers and children. Interventions to reduce expulsion from public preschool additionally benefit teachers’ workplace experiences, including reducing stress. The present study explores associations among supports and resources which promote children's social and emotional learning (SEL), teacher stress, and requests for expulsions in community-based preschool classrooms. Surveys and interviews of Chicago area preschool teachers provide rich detail of teachers’ experiences accessing and using supports in ways that impact their classroom emotions and disciplinary decisions. Although teachers who utilize SEL supports request fewer expulsions, the association is fully mediated by teachers’ stress. Furthermore, qualitative matrix comparisons demonstrate distinct differences in how teachers who request expulsions experience and utilize supports and manage their stress as compared to those who do not make such requests.",,"Zinsser, Katherine M.; Zulauf, Courtney A.; Nair Das, Vinoadharen; Callie Silver, H.",2019,10.1016/j.appdev.2017.11.006,1,466
495,Forestalling Preschool Expulsion: A Mixed-Method Exploration of the Potential Protective Role of Teachers’ Perceptions of Parents,"Preschoolers are being expelled at an alarming rate and little is known about protective factors. One factor may be the relationship between parents and teachers. Using surveys and interviews, the present study explores teachers’ perceptions of parents and center support as they relate to teachers’ requests to have a child removed from their classroom, an action related to expulsion. Teachers who have more negative perceptions of parents and perceive less center support working with parents were more likely to have requested a removal of a child in the past year. Qualitative comparisons yield differential themes around attribution of child behavior to parents and styles of engagement with parents between teachers who have requested a removal and those who have not.",parents; expulsion; attributions; mixed-method; preschool,"Zulauf, Courtney A.; Zinsser, Katherine M.",2019,10.3102/0002831219838236,1,467
