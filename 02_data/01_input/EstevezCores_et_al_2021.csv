4,The efficacy of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis,"Acceptance and Commitment therapy (ACT) has attracted a lot of interest during the last 10-15 years with a strong increase of the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The present review and meta-analysis includes 60 RCTs (4234 participants) on psychiatric disorders, somatic disorders, and stress at work. The mean effect size across all comparisons was small (0.42). Compared to the Ã–st (2008) meta-analysis there was no significant improvement in methodological quality and deterioration in effect size (from 0.68). When ACT was compared to various forms of cognitive or behavioral treatments a small and non-significant effect size of 0.16 was obtained. An evidence-base evaluation showed that ACT is not yet well-established for any disorder. It is probably efficacious for chronic pain and tinnitus, possibly efficacious for depression, psychotic symptoms, OCD, mixed anxiety, drug abuse, and stress at work, and experimental for the remaining disorders.

5,An intervention with firefighters to promote psychological occupational health according to the job demands-resources model [Una intervenciÃ³n con bomberos para promover la salud psicolÃ³gica en el trabajo siguiendo el modelo de demandas y recursos laborales],"This study reports an intervention programme to promote job resources (social support) to increase firefighters' psychological well-being (burnout and engagement), using the Job Demand-Resource Model as the theoretical model. Participants were firefighters from an elite Portuguese organization. The intervention consisted of a leadership stress management workshop for middle supervisors that lasted 21 hours spread over 3 days. The intervention group (n = 67) were subordinates whose immediate supervisors participated in the workshop, and the control group (n = 37) were subordinates whose supervisors did not. All participants filled out questionnaires before the workshop and 4 months after. The repeated measures ANOVA revealed as expected that Time x Intervention interaction increased colleagues' social support, and marginally also increased firefighters' vigor. However, contrary to expected the intervention also increased chronic demands. Discussion focuses on the importance of understanding the process underpinning change in occupational stress management interventions, especially in emergency professionals.

7,The effects of worksite stress management intervention on changes in coping styles,"In this study the effects of a worksite stress management intervention on changes in coping styles were examined. Ninety-five participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group participating in the intervention or to a control group with a delayed intervention. The stress management intervention was structured on enhancing so-called positive coping styles focused on problem solving and social diversion and on decreasing negativeâ€”emotion-focused and distractionâ€”coping. The results showed that in the experimental group the level of positive coping styles significantly increased. The effect of decreased negative coping styles due to the intervention was observed only in the group of participants with a high level of negative affectivity.

18,Battlemind Debriefing and Battlemind Training as Early Interventions With Soldiers Returning From Iraq: Randomization by Platoon,"Researchers have found that there is an increase in mental heath problems as a result of military-related traumatic events, and such problems increase in the months following return from combat. Nevertheless, researchers have not assessed the impact of early intervention efforts with this at-risk population. In the present study, the authors compared different early interventions with 2,297 U.S. soldiers following a year-long deployment to Iraq. Platoons were randomly assigned to standard postdeployment stress education, Battlemind debriefing, and small and large group Battlemind training. Results from a 4-month follow-up with 1,060 participants showed those with high levels of combat exposure who received Battlemind debriefing reported fewer posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression symptoms, and sleep problems than those in stress education. Small group Battlemind training participants with high combat exposure reported fewer posttraumatic stress symptoms and sleep problems than stress education participants. Compared to stress education participants, large group Battlemind training participants with high combat exposure reported fewer posttraumatic stress symptoms and lower levels of stigma and, regardless of combat exposure, reported fewer depression symptoms. Findings demonstrate that brief early interventions have the potential to be effective with at-risk occupational groups.

20,A group randomized trial of critical incident stress debriefing provided to U.S. peacekeepers,"In a group randomized trial of critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) with platoons of 952 peacekeepers, CISD was compared with a stress management class (SMC) and survey-only (SO) condition. Multilevel growth curve modeling found that CISD did not differentially hasten recovery compared to the other two conditions. For those soldiers reporting the highest degree of exposure to mission stressors, CISD was minimally associated with lower reports of posttraumatic stress and aggression (vs. SMC), higher perceived organizational support (vs. SO), and more alcohol problems than SMC and SO. Soldiers reported that they liked CISD more than the SMC, and CISD did not cause undue distress. Â© 2008 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.

21,Resilience training with soldiers during basic combat training: Randomisation by platoon,"Background: Resilience Training has the potential to mitigate mental health symptoms when provided during initial military training. Methods: The present study examined the impact of Resilience Training on US soldier well-being and attitudes during Basic Combat Training. Platoons were randomly assigned to Resilience Training or Military History provided during the first few days of Basic Combat Training. Surveys were conducted at baseline, post-intervention, and 3, 6, and 9 weeks. Results: The sample resulted in a total of 1,939 soldiers who completed at least the baseline and one follow-up survey. There were no significant differences between conditions in terms of depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or sleep problems. However, while anxiety decreased in both conditions, the rate of decrease was faster in the Resilience Training condition. In contrast, Resilience Training had a slower rate of increase in group cohesion over time than the Military History condition. In addition, Resilience Training was associated with greater confidence in helping others and received more positive ratings than Military History. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate that the brief Resilience Training studied here may have some utility in supporting mental health and peer support but may not benefit unit climate.

31,Yoga for Self-Care and Burnout Prevention Among Nurses,"The promotion of self-care and the prevention of burnout among nurses is a public health priority. Evidence supports the efficacy of yoga to improve physical and mental health outcomes, but few studies have examined the influence of yoga on nurse-specific outcomes. The purpose of this pilot-level randomized controlled trial was to examine the efficacy of yoga to improve self-care and reduce burnout among nurses. Compared with controls (n = 20), yoga participants (n = 20) reported significantly higher self-care as well as less emotional exhaustion and depersonalization upon completion of an 8-week yoga intervention. Although the control group demonstrated no change throughout the course of the study, the yoga group showed a significant improvement in scores from pre- to post-intervention for self-care (p < .001), mindfulness (p = .028), emotional exhaustion (p = .008), and depersonalization (p = .007) outcomes.

32,Short-term effects of a randomized controlled worksite relaxation intervention in Greece,"Objective. To evaluate the short-term benefits of simple relaxation techniques in white-collar employees.Materials and methods. The study was a two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial. 152 employees were randomly assigned to receive the 8-week programme (N=80) (relaxation breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, twice a day) or not (wait-list group N=72). Self-reported validated measures were used to evaluate perceived stress, health locus of control, job and lifestyle related variables. Saliva cortisol were also sampled and measured. Adjusted mean changes on outcomes were estimated by linear mixed model analysis. 127 employees were finally analyzed (68 in the intervention and 59 in the control group).Results. Specific stress-related symptoms, psychological job demands and cortisol levels were found to be significantly decreased after 8-weeks in the intervention group. The result was probably affected by the general socio-economic condition during the study period. Cortisol levels were also significantly related with age, family situation, gender and sampling time.Conclusions. Simple relaxation training (diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation) could benefit employees and it is strongly proposed that these and other similar techniques should be tested in various labour settings","Alexopoulos, Evangelos C.; Zisi, Marilena; Manola, Georgia; Darviri, Christina",1,10.5604/1232-1966.1108609,8

40,A web-based mindfulness stress management program in a corporate call center,"Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an 8-week web-based, mindfulness stress management program (WSM) in a corporate call center and added benefit of group support. Methods: One hundred sixty-one participants were randomized to WSM, WSM with group support, WSM with group and expert clinical support, or wait-list control. Perceived stress, burnout, emotional and psychological well-being, mindfulness, and productivity were measured at baseline, weeks 8 and 16, and 1 year. Results: Online usage was low with participants favoring CD use and group practice. All active groups demonstrated significant reductions in perceived stress and increases in emotional and psychological well-being compared with control. Group support improved participation, engagement, and outcomes.

42,Access to Health Programs at the Workplace and the Reduction of Work Presenteeism A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study,"Objective: To examine access to health programs at workplace as a determinant of presenteeism among adults. Methods: Data source was a subsample of the 2009-2010 Canadian Community Health Survey. The outcome was self-reported reduced activities at work (presenteeism). The explanatory variable was self-reported access to a health program at workplace. Logistic regression was used to measure the association between outcome and explanatory variables adjusting for potential confounders. Results: Adjusting for sex, age, education, income, work stress, and chronic conditions, presenteeism was not associated with having access to a health program at workplace (adjusted odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.65). The odds of presenteeism were higher in workers who reported high work stress and those with chronic medical conditions. Conclusions: This study found that access to health programs at workplace is not significantly associated with a decline in presenteeism.","Bustillos, Arnaldo Sanchez; Ortiz Trigoso, Oswaldo",0,10.1097/JOM.0b013e3182a299e8,13
43,Bridging the Gap: Workplace Mental Health Research in Canada,"Over the past few decades, poor employee mental health has become one of Canada's most prevalent and costly occupational health issues. The recently released Canadian National Standard on Psychological Health and Safety is helping to broaden the corporate perspective of mental health and provide organisations with more systematic workplace mental health guidelines. We suggest that it is theoretically and practically important for researchers to continue to pursue the following four areas of occupational mental health research: 1) the development of theory; 2) the standardization of strategy development and evaluation; 3) the improvement of longitudinal research; 4) and the application of workplace mental health strategies in natural workplace settings.","Dimoff, Jennifer K.; Kelloway, E.

44,Physical activity dose-response effects on outcomes of depression and anxiety,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the scientific evidence for a dose-response relation of physical activity with depressive and anxiety disorders. Methods: Computer database searches of MEDLINE, PsychLit, and Internet and personal retrieval systems to locate population studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and consensus panel judgments were conducted. Results: Observational studies demonstrate that greater amounts of occupational and leisure time physical activity are generally associated with reduced symptoms of depression. Quasi-experimental studies show that light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensify exercise can reduce symptoms of depression. However, no RCTs have varied frequency or duration of exercise and controlled for total energy expenditure in studies of depression or anxiety. Quasi-experimental and RCTs demonstrate that both resistance training and aerobic exercise can reduce symptoms of depression. Finally, the relation of exercise dose to changes in cardiorespiratory fitness is equivocal with some studies showing Chat fitness is associated with reduction of symptoms and others that have demonstrated reduction in symptoms without increases in fitness. Conclusion: All evidence for dose-response effects of physical activity and exercise come from B and C levels of evidence. There is little evidence for dose-response effects, though this is largely because of a lack of studies rather than a lack of evidence. A dose-response relation does, however, remain plausible.","Dunn, AL; Trivedi, MH; O'Neal, HA",0,10.1097/00005768-200106001-00027,15
45,The Effects of Workplace Occupational Mental Health and Related Activities on Psychological Distress Among Workers A Multilevel Cross-Sectional Analysis,"Objective: To investigate the association of workplace occupational mental health (OMH) and related activities with psychological distress of workers in Japan. Methods: A total of 121 workplaces and their 3540 workers were surveyed using questionnaires assessing selected workplace OM H activities, demographic characteristics, psychological distress, and psychosocial work environment of the workers. A multilevel analysis was conducted. Results: Promotion of communication correlated significantly and negatively with psychological distress among workers after adjusting for the covariates (P < 0.01). Occupational mental health activities correlated marginally significantly and negatively with psychological distress (P = 0.06). Their moderating effect for the worker-level association between psychosocial work environment and psychological distress was not significant. Conclusions: The findings suggest that promotion of communication in the workplace is associated with reduced psychological distress among workers. In addition, OMH activities may also be useful in reducing psychological distress.","Eguchi, Hisashi; Tsuda, Yoko; Tsukahara, Teruomi; Washizuka, Shinsuke; Kawakami, Norito; Nomiyama, Tetsuo",0,10.1097/JOM.0b013e31825107bb,16
46,Feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a yoga and mindfulness intervention for school teachers,"Many public school teachers face formidable challenges, including overcrowded classrooms, limited administrative resources, and high numbers of students with behavioral and emotional problems. Mindfulness-based strategies are a potentially promising means of reducing teachers' stress and enhancing their ability to handle job demands effectively. This pilot randomized study assessed the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a 6-session yoga and mindfulness program for teachers developed by the Holistic Life Foundation, a local nonprofit organization. Seven urban public schools were randomly assigned either to receive the intervention or to a nointervention control condition. A volunteer sample of teachers within those schools participated in the study, with 21 teachers attending the intervention and 22 teachers in the control arm. Intervention feasibility was assessed by examining recruitment response and intervention attendance and by gathering qualitative feedback from intervention instructors and participants. Participants also completed self-report measures of stress and burnout at baseline and post-test to provide preliminary information about intervention effects. Findings suggest the intervention may be beneficial for some teachers, but our recruitment response also highlighted feasibility challenges. Recommendations are presented for enhancing program feasibility and for advancing research on the use of yoga and mindfulness with teachers.

47,Factors associated with non-participation and drop-out in a lifestyle intervention for workers with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease,"Background: Non-response and drop-out are problems that are commonly encountered in health promotion trials. Understanding the health-related characteristics of non-participants and drop-outs and the reasons for non-participation and drop-out may be beneficial for future intervention trials.Methods: Male construction workers with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were invited to participate in a lifestyle intervention study. In order to investigate the associations between participation and CVD risk factors, and drop-out and CVD risk factors, crude and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. The reasons for non-participation and drop-out were assessed qualitatively.Results: 20% of the workers who were invited decided to participate; 8.6% of the participants dropped out before the first follow-up measurement. The main reasons for non-participation were 'no interest', 'current (para-)medical treatment', and 'feeling healthy', and for drop-out they were 'lack of motivation', 'current (para-)medical treatment', and 'disappointment'. Participants were 4.2 years older, had a higher blood pressure, higher total cholesterol, and lower HDL cholesterol than non-participants, and were more likely to report 'tiredness and/or stress' and 'chest pain and/or shortness of breath'. After adjusting for age, most risk factors were not significantly associated with participation. Drop-outs were 4.6 years younger than those who completed the study. The prevalence of smoking was higher among non-participants and drop-outs.Conclusion: Participants had a worse CVD risk profile than non-participants, mainly because of the difference in age. Non-participants and drop-outs were younger and more likely to be smokers. The main reasons for non-participation and drop-out were health-related. Investigators in the field of health promotion should be encouraged to share comparable information.","Groeneveld, Iris F.; Proper, Karin I.; van der Beek, Allard J.; Hildebrandt, Vincent H.; van Mechelen, Willem",0,10.1186/1479-5868-6-80,18
48,"When activation changes, what else changes? the relationship between change in patient activation measure (PAM) and employees' health status and health behaviors","Objective: To test whether changes in the patient activation measure (PAM) are related to changes in health status and healthy behaviors.Methods: Data for this secondary analysis were taken from a group-randomized, controlled trial comparing a traditional health promotion program for employees with an activated consumer program and a control program. The study population included 320 employees (with and without chronic disease) from two U.S. companies: a large, integrated health care system and a national airline. Survey and biometric data were collected in Spring 2005 (baseline) and Spring 2007 (follow-up).Results: Change in PAM was associated with changes in health behaviors at every level (1-4), especially at level 4. Changes related to overall risk score and many of its components: aerobic exercise, safety, cancer risk, stress and mental health. Other changes included frequency of eating breakfast and the likelihood of knowing about health plans and how they compare.Conclusion: Level 4 of patient activation is not an end-point. People are capable of continuing to make significant change within this level. Practice implications: Interventions should be designed to encourage movement from lower to higher levels of activation. Even people at the most activated level improve health behaviors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

49,"The Effects of a Short-term Mindfulness Based Intervention on Self-reported Mindfulness, Decentering, Executive Attention, Psychological Health, and Coping Style: Examining Unique Mindfulness Effects and Mediators","The majority of mindfulness intervention studies do not include active control groups. To examine potential unique effects of mindfulness practice and to study the mechanism responsible for beneficial mental health effects associated with mindfulness-based interventions, the present study compared mindfulness meditation with an active control group in a randomised controlled trial. A short-term mindfulness-based intervention (n=046) was compared with both an active control group-relaxation training (n=040)and an inactive wait-list group (n=040) on self-reported mindfulness and decentering, executive attention, psychological well-being, anxiety, depression, and coping style, in an adult working population with no prior meditation experience. Analyses of covariance showed that the mindfulness group scored higher than the wait-list group on self-reported mindfulness and psychological well-being. However, no differences were found on decentering, anxiety, depression, executive attention, or coping style. Moreover, the study failed to distinguish any unique mindfulness effects since there were no differences between mindfulness and relaxation on any of the variables. Simple mediation analyses, using a bootstrap approach, revealed that decentering acted as a mediator between self-reported mindfulness and psychological well-being. The length of the intervention, the similarities between body scan exercises in MBI and relaxation, and the absence of decentering effects may partly explain the lack of distinct MBI effects, suggesting that MBIs aimed at increasing well-being and problem-focused coping whilst reducing psychological symptoms in a working population should be longer than merely 4 weeks and include more than seven sessions.","Josefsson, Torbjorn; Lindwall, Magnus; Broberg, Anders G.",0,10.1007/s12671-012-0142-1,20
50,"Nurses' experiences, expectations, and preferences for mind-body practices to reduce stress","Background: Most research on the impact of mind-body training does not ask about participants' baseline experience, expectations, or preferences for training. To better plan participant-centered mind-body intervention trials for nurses to reduce occupational stress, such descriptive information would be valuable.Methods: We conducted an anonymous email survey between April and June, 2010 of North American nurses interested in mind-body training to reduce stress. The e-survey included: demographic characteristics, health conditions and stress levels; experiences with mind-body practices; expected health benefits; training preferences; and willingness to participate in future randomized controlled trials.Results: Of the 342 respondents, 96% were women and 92% were Caucasian. Most (73%) reported one or more health conditions, notably anxiety (49%); back pain (41%); GI problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (34%); or depression (33%). Their median occupational stress level was 4 (0 = none; 5 = extreme stress). Nearly all (99%) reported already using one or more mind-body practices to reduce stress: intercessory prayer (86%), breath-focused meditation (49%), healing or therapeutic touch (39%), yoga/tai chi/qi gong (34%), or mindfulness-based meditation (18%). The greatest expected benefits were for greater spiritual well-being (56%); serenity, calm, or inner peace (54%); better mood (51%); more compassion (50%); or better sleep (42%). Most (65%) wanted additional training; convenience (74% essential or very important), was more important than the program's reputation (49%) or scientific evidence about effectiveness (32%) in program selection. Most (65%) were willing to participate in a randomized trial of mind-body training; among these, most were willing to collect salivary cortisol (60%), or serum biomarkers (53%) to assess the impact of training.Conclusions: Most nurses interested in mind-body training already engage in such practices. They have greater expectations about spiritual and emotional than physical benefits, but are willing to participate in studies and to collect biomarker data. Recruitment may depend more on convenience than a program's scientific basis or reputation. Knowledge of participants' baseline experiences, expectations, and preferences helps inform future training and research on mind-body approaches to reduce stress.","Kemper, Kathi; Bulla, Sally; Krueger, Deborah; Ott, Mary Jane; McCool, Jane A.; Gardiner, Paula",0,10.1186/1472-6882-11-26,21
51,Workplace mental health: developing an integrated intervention approach,"Background: Mental health problems are prevalent and costly in working populations. Workplace interventions to address common mental health problems have evolved relatively independently along three main threads or disciplinary traditions: medicine, public health, and psychology. In this Debate piece, we argue that these three threads need to be integrated to optimise the prevention of mental health problems in working populations.Discussion: To realise the greatest population mental health benefits, workplace mental health intervention needs to comprehensively 1) protect mental health by reducing work-related risk factors for mental health problems; 2) promote mental health by developing the positive aspects of work as well as worker strengths and positive capacities; and 3) address mental health problems among working people regardless of cause. We outline the evidence supporting such an integrated intervention approach and consider the research agenda and policy developments needed to move towards this goal, and propose the notion of integrated workplace mental health literacy.Summary: An integrated approach to workplace mental health combines the strengths of medicine, public health, and psychology, and has the potential to optimise both the prevention and management of mental health problems in the workplace.","LaMontagne, Anthony D.; Martin, Angela; Page, Kathryn M.; Reavley, Nicola J.; Noblet, Andrew J.; Milner, Allison J.; Keegel, Tessa; Smith, Peter M.",0,10.1186/1471-244X-14-131,22
52,"Occupational burnout, eating behavior, and weight among working women","Background: Eating behavior affects weight and thus the development of obesity. Studies on the effect of occupational burnout (exhaustive fatigue, cynicism, and lost occupational self-respect caused by chronic work stress) on eating behavior are lacking.Objective: The objective was to investigate associations between occupational burnout, eating behavior, and weight among working women.Design: A total of 230 working women participated in a randomized controlled intervention trial (Nuadu) that aimed at changing the health behaviors of those with health risks. We assessed eating behavior using the Three-Factor Eating Behavior Questionnaire 18 and burnout using the Bergen Burnout Indicator 15 at both baseline and 12 mo. Body weight and percentage body fat were also measured at baseline and at 12 mo. The intervention and control groups were combined and divided by burnout and weight-change variables.Results: Women experiencing burnout at baseline had significantly higher scores in emotional eating (EE; P = 0.002) and uncontrolled eating (UE; P = 0.001) than did those without burnout. A significant difference was found between the change in UE from baseline to 12 mo in those with and without burnout (P = 0.05). UE decreased significantly among those without burnout at baseline (P < 0.001).Conclusions: Those experiencing burnout may be more vulnerable to EE and TIE and have a hindered ability to make changes in their eating behavior. We recommend that burnout should be treated first and that burnout and eating behavior should be evaluated in obesity treatment.

54,Developing a web-based stress management intervention for occupational support workers,"Background. Occupational support workers in the mental healthcare sector are exposed to considerable occupational stress and have little access to stress management facilities.Aims. This article describes the process behind creating a web-based stress management intervention (SMI) for occupational support workers in the mental healthcare sector.Method. Mixed methods were used to inform the content of the web-based SMI, following MRC strategy for designing interventions and PRIMA-EF guidelines for best practice in SMI design. We conducted a literature review to ascertain the content of interventions that had been shown to be successful in reducing stress in mental healthcare populations. In addition, we conducted focus groups in order to assess specific stressors that individuals in the occupational support sector deemed to be important.Results. The literature review showed that a variety of methods had been successful for reducing occupational stress in the mental healthcare sector including: Relaxation and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy techniques, and skills training in; time management, problem-solving and communication. Individuals in the focus groups identified both personal and organisational stressors to be addressed in the intervention.Conclusions. This intervention was developed with reference to a design strategy, using input from the target population.","Ridge, Mary; Wells, John; Denny, Margaret; Cunningham, Jennifer; Chalder, Trudie",0,10.3109/09638237.2011.556162,24
55,Counterbalancing misrepresentations of critical incident stress debriefing and critical incident stress management,"The July 2003 edition of the Australian Psychologist was dedicated to a state-of-the-art description of occupational stress and wellbeing. It contained an article on psychological debriefing by Devilly and Cotton (2003), that misrepresents many aspects of the current field of knowledge and practice of Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) and Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD). The authors inappropriately generalise from a few very flawed studies of single session, once-off, individual debriefings to CISM, which operates in the workplace. Allegations are made of unethical and bad practices without substantiation. This paper addresses these and other issues raised by the article. As well, it asserts the value, to both individuals and organisations, of properly run CISM programs and CISD interventions.","Robinson, R",0,10.1080/00050060410001660308,25
56,The Vital@Work Study. The systematic development of a lifestyle intervention to improve older workers' vitality and the design of a randomised controlled trial evaluating this intervention,"Background: A major contributor of early exit from work is a decline in health with increasing age. As healthy lifestyle choices contribute to better health outcomes, an intervention aimed at an improved lifestyle is considered a potentially effective tool to keep older workers healthy and vital, and thereby to prolong labour participation.Methods: Using the Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol, a lifestyle intervention was developed based on information obtained from 1) literature, 2) a short lifestyle questionnaire aimed at indentifying the lifestyle behaviours among the target group, and 3) focusgroup (FG) interviews among 36 older workers (aged 45(+) years) aimed at identifying: a) key determinants of lifestyle behaviour, b) a definition of vitality, and c) ideas about how vitality can be improved by lifestyle.The main lifestyle problems identified were: insufficient levels of physical activity and insufficient intake of fruit and vegetables. Using information from both literature and FG interviews, vitality consists of a mental and a physical component. The interviewees suggested to improve the mental component of vitality by means of relaxation exercises (e. g. yoga); physical vitality could be improved by aerobic endurance exercise and strength training.The lifestyle intervention (6 months) consists of three visits to a Personal Vitality Coach (PVC) combined with a Vitality Exercise Programme (VEP). The VEP consists of: 1) once a week a guided yoga group session aimed at relaxation exercises, 2) once a week a guided aerobic workout group session aimed at improving aerobic fitness and increasing muscle strength, and 3) older workers will be asked to perform once a week for at least 45 minutes vigorous physical activity without face-to-face instructions (e. g. fitness). Moreover, free fruit will be offered at the group sessions of the VEP. The lifestyle intervention will be evaluated in a RCT among older workers of two major academic hospitals in the Netherlands. At baseline, after 6 and 12 months, measurements (primary: lifestyle and vitality, and secondary: work-engagement and productivity) will take place.Discussion: The lifestyle programme is developed specifically tailored to the needs of the older workers and which is aimed at improving their vitality.","Strijk, Jorien E.; Proper, Karin I.; van der Beek, Allard J.; van Mechelen, Willem",0,10.1186/1471-2458-9-408,26
58,The role of physical activity and heart rate variability for the control of work related stress,"Physical activity (PA) and exercise are often used as tools to reduce stress and therefore the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Meanwhile, heart rate variability (H RV) has been utilized to assess both stress and PA or exercise influences. The objective of the present review was to examine the current literature in regards to workplace stress, PA/exercise and HRV to encourage further studies. We considered original articles from known databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge) over the last 10 years that examined these important factors. A total of seven studies were identified with workplace stress strongly associated with reduced HRV in workers. Longitudinal workplace PA interventions may provide a means to improve worker stress levels and potentially cardiovascular risk with mechanisms still to be clarified. Future studies are recommended to identify the impact of PA, exercise, and fitness on stress levels and HRV in workers and their subsequent influence on cardiovascular health.","Tonello, Lais; Rodrigues, Fabio B.; Souza, Jeniffer W.

59,Mindfulness-Based Interventions Reduce Psychological Distress in Working Adults: a Meta-Analysis of Intervention Studies,"The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for reducing psychological distress in working adults. A comprehensive literature search of relevant databases included articles written in English published on December 2012. The meta-analysis included 19 controlled and uncontrolled intervention studies with a total of 1,139 participants. Analyses yielded medium-to-large mean effect sizes for the within-group (preâ€“post) comparison (Hedges's g = 0.68, 95Â % confidence interval (CI) [0.58, 0.78]) and for the between-group (Hedges's g = 0.68, 95Â % CI [0.48, 0.88]) comparison of MBI with an inactive control. Effectiveness was largely maintained at a median follow-up of 5Â weeks (Hedges's g = 0.60, 95Â % CI [0.46, 0.75]). Analyses based on subgroup comparisons suggested that brief versions of mindfulness-based stress reduction developed for organisational settings are equally effective as standard 8-week versions originally developed for clinical settings. However, there is little evidence to suggest that MBIs are more effective than other types of occupational stress management interventions, such as relaxation training and yoga, for reducing psychological distress in working adults. Overall, these findings support the use of MBIs in organisational settings for the reduction of psychological distress. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

60,Mindfulness Interventions to Reduce Stress Among Nursing Personnel An Occupational Health Perspective,"Workplace stress within health care settings is rampant and predicted to increase in coming years. The profound effects of workplace stress on the health and safety of nursing personnel and the financial impact on organizations are well documented. Although organizational modification can reduce some sources of stress, several unique stress-producing factors inherent in the work of nursing personnel are immutable to such approaches. Mindfulness training, an evidence-based approach to increase situational awareness and positive responses to stressful situations, is an inexpensive strategy to reduce stress and improve the quality of nurses' work lives. Several approaches to training, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, can be tailored to health care settings. Considerations for occupational health nurses in incorporating mindfulness training as an aspect of a comprehensive work site health promotion program for nursing and other hospital personnel are discussed.","Zeller, Janice M.; Levin, Pamela F.",0,10.3928/21650799-20130116-67,29
64,What's the Hard Return On Employee Wellness Programs?,"Employee wellness programs have often been viewed as a nice extra, not a strategic imperative. But the data demonstrate otherwise, according to Berry, of Texas A&M University; Mirabito, of Baylor University; and Baun, of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Their research shows that the ROI on comprehensive, well-run employee wellness programs is impressive, sometimes as high as six to one. To achieve those kinds of results, employers cannot merely offer workers a few passes to a fitness center and nutrition information in the cafeteria. The most successful wellness programs are supported by six essential pillars: engaged leadership at multiple levels; strategic alignment with the company's identity and aspirations; a design that is broad in scope and high in relevance and quality; broad accessibility; internal and external partnerships; and effective communications. Companies in a variety of industries-including Johnson & Johnson, Lowe's, H-E-B, and Healthwise-have built their employee wellness programs on all six pillars and have reaped big rewards in the form of lower costs, greater productivity, and higher morale. Those benefits are not easy to achieve, and verifiable paybacks are never a certainty. But the track record inspires emulation, especially when you see the numbers.","Berry, LL; Mirabito, AM; Baun, WB",0,,30
65,What factors are associated with the outcome of individual-focused worksite stress management interventions?,"There is a need to understand more of the factors governing the effectiveness of individual-focused stress management interventions in the workplace. This article examines research contrasting different approaches to stress management. It is argued that due to design and methodological limitations in the majority of studies, a new generation of research is required which (a) delineates clearly between interventions of differing technical content; (b) includes session process measures to help distinguish the degree of outcome variance associated with specific and non-specific factors; (c) focuses on the moderators of change enabling greater understanding of the circumstances in which a particular stress management intervention is appropriate; and, (d) examines the mediators of change thereby increasing our understanding of the psychological mechanisms underpinning outcome change. A framework is proposed to help guide future research into these issues.","Bunce, D",0,10.1111/j.2044-8325.1997.tb00627.x,31
66,Participatory work place intervention for stress prevention in primary health care. A randomized controlled trial,"The aim of this study is to explore whether a participatory, organizational intervention can reduce work-related risk factors, and thereby prevent stress-related ill health. We build on the job demand-control and effort-reward imbalance models of stress. It is a two-armed randomized trial, with one primary health care unit receiving the intervention and a two-unit control group. Validated questionnaires for the assessment of psychosocial work environment and health were administered, at the baseline and at 6 and 12-month follow up. The primary outcome was job strain. Secondary outcomes were effortâ€“reward imbalance, exhaustion, sleep, and recovery. Group-level objective data on workload and data about relevant processes during the study were continuously collected. The changes in the intervention group with regard to job strain, effort-reward imbalance, exhaustion, sleep and recovery were not statistically different from changes in the control group. For the non-exhausted employees though, reward was significantly higher at follow up compared to baseline, but only in the intervention group. An important piece of information is that the objective workload was statistically significantly higher in the intervention group throughout the study. Not all the components of the intervention were implemented as intended. Context and process information, such as objective data and implementation fidelity are necessary for a valid interpretation of the results.

67,Implementation of Mindfulness Training for Mental Health Staff: Organizational Context and Stakeholder Perspectives,"Occupational stress and burnout adversely impacts mental health care staff well-being and patient outcomes. Mindfulness training reduces staff stress and may improve patient care. However, few studies explore mental health setting implementation. This qualitative study used focus groups to evaluate stakeholders' perceptions of organizational factors affecting implementation of an adapted version of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for staff on adolescent mental health units. Common facilitators included leadership securing buy-in with staff, allocating staff time to participate, and quiet space for training and practice. Other facilitators were past staff knowledge of mindfulness, local champions, and acculturating staff with mindfulness through a non-mandatory training attendance policy. Common barriers were limited staff time to attend training sessions and insufficient training coverage for some staff. Staff also reported improved focus when interacting with adolescents and improved social cohesion on the units. We conclude that a mindfulness-based program for reducing occupational stress can be successfully implemented on adolescent mental health units. Implementation appeared to change the social context of the units, including staff and patient interactions. More broadly, our findings highlight the importance of environmental factors in shaping attitudes, diffusion of innovation, and acculturation of wellness program implementations.","Byron, Gerard; Ziedonis, Douglas M.; McGrath, Caroline; Frazier, Jean A.; detTrrijos, Fernando; Fulwiler, Carl",0,10.1007/s12671-014-0330-2,33
68,How do management and non-management employees perceive workplace wellness programmes? A qualitative examination,"Objectives: The value of workplace wellness programmes (WWPs) has been established in the literature. Such programmes, however, have an increased likelihood for success when both management and non-management employees' perspectives and needs are incorporated into development and implementation. This study aimed to identify the perspectives of each of these two employee groups as a means of informing the future development and implementation of WWPs. Methods: Nine focus groups (N=56) were held in western Canada with participants employed at four diverse organisations consisting of >100 employees. Each participating organisation provided two separate groups, consisting of one management group and one non-management group. Participants were asked to share their perceptions, attitudes and beliefs concerning WWPs. Thematic inductive analysis was conducted to elicit emergent areas of focus. Results: Three areas of focus were identified: (1) role of the company in WWPs, (2) elements of successful WWPs and (3) mandatory participation in WWPs. Providing a clear indication of the roles and responsibilities of both employee groups, making these initiatives part of the organisational strategic plan, demonstrating a long term commitment to such programmes, and having employees play participatory roles in the design, implementation and decision making process, are components that need consideration. Conclusion: Both employee groups agreed that their organisation played a role in employee health. Similarities and discrepancies of the beliefs between groups are highlighted and key considerations are presented. Findings have implications for the future development and implementation of WWPs.","Caperchione, CM; Reid, RC; Sharp, PG; Stehmeier, J",0,10.1177/0017896915607911,34
69,Intervention studies to foster resilience â€“ A systematic review and proposal for a resilience framework in future intervention studies,"Psychological resilience refers to the phenomenon that many people are able to adapt to the challenges of life and maintain mental health despite exposure to adversity. This has stimulated research on training programs to foster psychological resilience. We evaluated concepts, methods and designs of 43 randomized controlled trials published between 1979 and 2014 which assessed the efficacy of such training programs and propose standards for future intervention research based on recent developments in the field. We found that concepts, methods and designs in current resilience intervention studies are of limited use to properly assess efficacy of interventions to foster resilience. Major problems are the use of definitions of resilience as trait or a composite of resilience factors, the use of unsuited assessment instruments, and inappropriate study designs. To overcome these challenges, we propose 1) an outcome-oriented definition of resilience, 2) an outcome-oriented assessment of resilience as change in mental health in relation to stressor load, and 3) methodological standards for suitable study designs of future intervention studies. Our proposals may contribute to an improved quality of resilience intervention studies and may stimulate further progress in this growing research field.

70,Integrated Approaches to Occupational Health and Safety: A Systematic Review,"Objective. The study objective was to conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of integrated workplace interventions that combine health promotion with occupational health and safety.Data Source. Electronic databases (n = 8), including PsychInfo and MEDLINE, were systematically searched.Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Studies included were those that reported on workplace interventions that met the consensus definition of an ""integrated approach,'' published in English, in the scientific literature since 1990. Data Extraction.Data extracted were occupation, worksite, country, sample size, intervention targets, follow-up period, and results reported. Quality was assessed according to American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine Practice Guidelines.Data Synthesis. Heterogeneity precluded formal meta-analyses. Results were classified according to the outcome(s) assessed into five categories (health promotion, injury prevention, occupational health and safety management, psychosocial, and return-on-investment). Narrative synthesis of outcomes was performed.Results. A total of 31 eligible studies were identified; 23 (74%) were (quasi-) experimental trials. Effective interventions were most of those aimed at improving employee physical or mental health. Less consistent results were reported from integrated interventions targeting occupational health and safety management, injury prevention, or organizational cost savings.Conclusion. Integrated approaches have been posed as comprehensive solutions to complex issues. Empirical evidence, while still emerging, provides some support for this. Continuing investment in, and evaluation of, integrated approaches are worthwhile.","Cooklin, A.; Joss, N.; Husser, E.; Oldenburg, B.",0,10.4278/ajhp.141027-LIT-542,36
72,Communicating Health at Work: Organizational Wellness Programs as Identity Bridges,"With the growth in workplace health promotion (WHP) initiatives, organizations are asking employees to enact their personal health identities at work. To understand this prominent yet poorly understood phenomenon, we surveyed 204 employees at a company with a WHP program and found that participation in the wellness program mediated personal health and organizational identities. Results fill a gap in communication literature by demonstrating the effect of individual identity enactment on organizational identification and contribute to recent research stressing the relationship between identity and health behaviors. In addition, findings illuminate the role of situated activity in identity negotiation, suggesting that certain activities in organizations, like wellness programs, serve as identity bridges between personal and work-related identity targets.","Dailey, SL; Zhu, YG",0,10.1080/10410236.2015.1120698,37
73,"Job design, employment practices and well-being: a systematic review of intervention studies","There is inconsistent evidence that deliberate attempts to improve job design realise improvements in well-being. We investigated the role of other employment practices, either as instruments for job redesign or as instruments that augment job redesign. Our primary outcome was well-being. Where studies also assessed performance, we considered performance as an outcome. We reviewed 33 intervention studies. We found that well-being and performance may be improved by: training workers to improve their own jobs; training coupled with job redesign; and system wide approaches that simultaneously enhance job design and a range of other employment practices. We found insufficient evidence to make any firm conclusions concerning the effects of training managers in job redesign and that participatory approaches to improving job design have mixed effects. Successful implementation of interventions was associated with worker involvement and engagement with interventions, managerial commitment to interventions and integration of interventions with other organisational systems.Practitioner Summary: Improvements in well-being and performance may be associated with system-wide approaches that simultaneously enhance job design, introduce a range of other employment practices and focus on worker welfare. Training may have a role in initiating job redesign or augmenting the effects of job design on well-being.","Daniels, Kevin; Gedikli, Cigdem; Watson, David; Semkina, Antonina; Vaughn, Oluwafunmilayo",0,10.1080/00140139.2017.1303085,38

Rookie police officers (N = 18) participated in a randomized trial of a 10-week imagery and skills training program versus training as usual. Twelve months later, psychophysiological stress and police work performance were assessed during a live critical incident simulation. Training resulted in significantly less negative mood, less heart rate reactivity, a larger increase in antithrombin, and better police performance compared to controls. Trends for cortisol and self-reported stress also suggested benefits of training. This novel training program is a promising paradigm for improving police well-being, stress resiliency, and optimizing job performance.

75,Prospects for a clinical science of mindfulness-based intervention,"Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are at a pivotal point in their future development. Spurred on by an everincreasing number of studies and breadth of clinical application, the value of such approaches may appear self-evident. We contend, however, that the public health impact of MBIs can be enhanced significantly by situating this work in a broader framework of clinical psychological science. Utilizing the National Institutes of Health stage model (Onken, Carroll, Shoham, Cuthbert,&Riddle, 2014), we map the evidence base for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction as exemplars of MBIs. From this perspective, we suggest that important gaps in the current evidence base become apparent and, furthermore, that generating more of the same types of studies without addressing such gaps will limit the relevance and reach of these interventions. We offer a set of 7 recommendations that promote an integrated approach to core research questions, enhanced methodological quality of individual studies, and increased logical links among stages of clinical translation in order to increase the potential of MBIs to impact positively the mental health needs of individuals and communities.

76,Assessment of a prevention program for work-related stress among urban police officers,"To determine the efficacy of a primary prevention program designed to improve psychobiological responses to stress among urban police officers. A random sample of 37 police cadets received complementary training in psychological and technical techniques to reduce anxiety and enhance performance when facing a series of police critical incidents. Training was done by Special Forces officers, trained by the authors in imaging. A random sample of 38 cadets, receiving training as usual, was followed in parallel. Assessment of somatic and psychological health, and stress biomarkers, was done at baseline, immediately following training, and after 18 months as regular police officers. Comparison was done using two-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) and logistic regression. The intervention group improved their general health and problem-based coping as compared to the control group. They also demonstrated lower levels of stomach problems, sleep difficulties, and exhaustion. Training was associated with an OR of 4.1 (95% CI, 1.3-13.7; p < 0.05) for improved GHQ scores during the study as compared to no changes or worsening score. This first primary prevention study of high-risk professions demonstrates the validity and functional utility of the intervention. Beneficial effects lasted at least during the first 2 years on the police force. It is suggested that preventive imagery training in first responders might contribute to enhanced resiliency.","Arnetz, BB; Arble, E; Backman, L; Lynch, A; Lublin, A",1,10.1007/s00420-012-0748-6,41
78,"THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF WORK-SITE WELLNESS PROGRAMS FOR HYPERTENSION CONTROL, WEIGHT-LOSS, AND SMOKING CESSATION","The cost-effectiveness of work-site wellness programs for reducing cardiovascular disease risks of employees was examined at three manufacturing plants. A fourth plant was used as a control site to estimate levels of risk reduction achieved from wellness screening and preexisting services, without further interventions. The cardiovascular disease risks included in the study were hypertension, obesity, and cigarette smoking. The annual direct cost per employee for postscreening interventions was $2.97 for site 1 (control site), $17.68 for site 2 (health education), $30.96 for site 3 (health education plus follow-up counseling), and $38.31 for site 4 (health education, follow-up counseling plus plant organization for health promotion). Of the three experimental sites, sites 3 and 4 were more effective and more cost-effective than was site 2, both in terms of engaging employees at risk of cardiovascular disease into treatment or program participation and of reducing their risks or preventing relapse. For engaging employees into treatment/program participation, sites 3 and 4 were nine to ten times more cost-effective than was site 2; for reducing risks/preventing relapse, sites 3 and 4 were five to six times more cost-effective than was site 2. At sites 3 and 4, the total direct cost per percent of risks reduced/relapse prevented was less than one dollar ($.67 and $.74, respectively) per employee per year. Program costs may vary considerably across companies because of differences in salary structures and overhead costs. These are held constant in this report for comparison across program models.","ERFURT, JC; FOOTE, A; HEIRICH, MA",0,,42
80,Outcome expectancy as a process indicator in comprehensive worksite stress management interventions,"This study investigates the relationship between outcome expectancy for an individual stress management course and the total perceived impact of a comprehensive stress management intervention (SMI). It is based on data from 3 different measurement points from a longitudinal SMI in Switzerland. Individual and organizational outcome expectancies for stress management courses were captured with 2 newly developed items (SMI outcome expectancy) immediately after course completion. Perceived individual and organizational impacts of the overall intervention captured with 2 items of a retrospective impact assessment scale (perceived SMI impact) at the 2-year follow-up survey were used as the outcome measurement. Baseline individual and organizational change commitments (as rated by participants) were included in the analyses as possible moderators. Regression analyses show that individual and organizational outcome expectancies with respect to stress management courses can to some extent predict the perceived impact of the intervention as a whole. At the individual level, an intervention will be perceived as most successful when participants already have a high individual change commitment and develop high outcome expectancies during stress management courses.

We conducted this study to understand a) the demand among different health professionals for an online MBS course; b) engagement with different MBS topics; and c) planned behavior changes.Methods: We examined registrations from May 1 through August 31, 2014 for a new online MBS elective, analyzing the percentage of registrants who engaged with one or more of 12 modules by September 30, 2014. We also reviewed written comments about planned behavior change.Results: The 693 registrants included physicians, nurses, social workers, dietitians, psychologists, and others. The two most popular topics were ""Introduction: to Stress, Resilience, and Relaxation Response"" and ""Autogenic Training"". Half of registrants (57%) engaged with at least one module and 9% completed all 12 modules within the study period. Nearly all (90%) of those who completed evaluations planned to use the technique they learned for themselves, introduce it to patients, or both.Discussion: Online elective MBS training attracts diverse health professionals and leads to plans for personal and professional behavior change.

82,An automated and systematic web-based intervention for stress management and organizational health promotion,"Healthy organizations are proactive and focus systematically on interventions for health promotion and a sustainable work environment. They have concrete tools for employees, managers and management to proactively and reactively promote and monitor a good psychosocial and physical work environment. The workplace should be adaptive to the needs of the employees and vice versa. It is also important to plan for today and tomorrow and prioritize long-term benefits and sustainable solutions. This chapter presents the theoretical framework and practical experiences of using the HealthWatch tool for systematic organizational health promotion. It describes an automated web-based intervention for organizational health promotion and provides important lessons learned when developing and implementing such web-based tools. The chapter also outlines an approach for how to strive for a healthy organization through proactive and reactive efforts and by systematic focus on interventions for health promotion and a sustainable work environment. It discusses strategies for assessing the psychosocial work-environment and health related factors. It also describes how to implement real-time/regular monitoring with early warning systems in order to proactively counteract ill health and dysfunctional group patterns at an early stage. The importance of implementing standardized/tailored action plans directed to all levels of the organization; employees, managers and management is emphasized. It is concluded that organizational health promotion may increase organizational profits, wellbeing and reduce absenteeism and thereby making it possible to endure in the competitive economy of today and tomorrow.

83,How Is Stress Reduced by a Workplace Mindfulness Intervention? A Qualitative Study Conceptualising Experiences of Change,"Mindfulness-based interventions are effective as curative and preventative approaches to psychological health. However, the mechanisms by which outcomes are secured from such interventions when delivered in the workplace, and to a stressed workforce, are not well understood. The aim of the present study was to elicit and analyse accounts from past participants of a workplace mindfulness intervention in order to generate a preliminary model of how positive benefits appear to be secured. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were completed with 21 employees of a higher education institution who had completed an eight-week intervention based on Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, adapted for the workplace. Interviews invited participants to recount their experiences of the intervention and its impact, if any, on their work life. Aspects of the interview data that pertained to intervention experience and positive benefits were analysed using a version of grounded theory, leading to the generation of a provisional model of how positive change occurred. The model suggests that discrete, temporal experiences build on each other to generate multiple, positive benefits. As anticipated in mindfulness-based interventions, enhanced attentional capacity was important, but our provisional model also suggests that resonance, self-care, detection of stress markers, perceiving choice, recovering self-agency and upward spiralling may be central mechanisms that lead to positive outcomes. Understanding mechanisms of change may help support participant engagement and trust in work-based mindfulness programmes, and enhance participantsâ€™ ability to apply mindfulness in their work life.

84,A randomized trial of written emotional disclosure interventions in school teachers: Controlling for positive expectancies and effects on health and job satisfaction,"Writing expressively about distressing experiences has been found to have beneficial health effects. This study examined the effects of written emotional disclosure (WED) interventions on the self-reported health and job satisfaction of school teachers, and compared standard WED instructions with two commonly used more prescriptive variants. The study also controlled and measured the between-condition comparability of participants post-writing benefit expectations. Teachers (final N = 77) were randomized to a control writing condition or one of three WED conditions that varied the number and/or type of experiences participants wrote about. All teachers wrote for 20 min on three consecutive days at home. Psychological health, physical health, and job satisfaction were assessed at baseline, two weeks, two months, and six months post-intervention. Participants expectations of benefit following writing were equivalent across conditions. There was no significant effect of any of the three WED interventions, compared to control writing, on psychological or physical health or job satisfaction. There was, however, a significant and sizeable improvement in physical health across writing conditions from baseline to two-month follow-up, and this was maintained at six months. The findings show that control writing can produce comparable expectations of benefit to WED, and are consistent with the possibility that benefit expectancies can effect health improvements following disclosure or control writing. Most previous studies have examined WED with students or patient groups, and the findings also raise an important question about the feasibility of multi-session writing interventions for mid-life working samples. Further studies with occupational groups are warranted, as is further investigation into the role of positive expectancies in WED effects.

85,Hair cortisol: A new tool for evaluating stress in programs of stress management,"Aims: Longitudinal and experimental studies have shown that chronic stress contributes to the onset and progression of different diseases. Although it is not possible to eliminate stress completely, people can learn to manage it by participating in different kinds of stress management interventions. This study examined the effectiveness of stress management interventions on neuroendocrine responses in stressed students and health professionals, by measuring hair cortisol in comparison to salivary cortisol. Main methods: Salivary and hair cortisol measurements were performed in 37 subjects (31 women, 6 men; mean age 34.0 +/- 10.6) who attended to a Coping Stress and Quality of Care Program at the University of Buenos Aires. Cortisol was measured at the beginning and at the end of the program. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory STAI was used to evaluate state and trait anxiety. Key findings: In subjects who completed the program, no differences were observed in salivary cortisol levels between the first and the last session. However, in these subjects, hair cortisol obtained in the last session was significantly lower than hair cortisol in the first session. Significance: Hair cortisol appears to be a better biomarker than salivary cortisol for evaluation of the effectiveness of a stress reduction program and it seems to be a better indicator of stress system dysregulation as well.

86,Conceptualizing the dynamics of workplace stress: a systems-based study of nursing aides,"Background: Workplace stress is a complex phenomenon that may often be dynamic and evolving over time. Traditional linear modeling does not allow representation of recursive feedback loops among the implicated factors. The objective of this study was to develop a multidimensional system dynamics model (SDM) of workplace stress among nursing aides and conduct simulations to illustrate how changes in psychosocial perceptions and workplace factors might influence workplace stress over time.Methods: Eight key informants with prior experience in a large study of US nursing home workers participated in model building. Participants brainstormed the range of components related to workplace stress. Components were grouped together based on common themes and translated into feedback loops. The SDM was parameterized through key informant insight on the shape and magnitude of the relationship between model components. Model construction was also supported utilizing survey data collected as part of the larger study. All data was entered into the software program, Vensim. Simulations were conducted to examine how adaptations to model components would influence workplace stress.Results: The SDM included perceptions of organizational conditions (e.g., job demands and job control), workplace social support (i.e., managerial and coworker social support), workplace safety, and demands outside of work (i.e. work-family conflict). Each component was part of a reinforcing feedback loop. Simulations exhibited that scenarios with increasing job control and decreasing job demands led to a decline in workplace stress. Within the context of the system, the effects of workplace social support, workplace safety, and work-family conflict were relatively minor.Conclusion: SDM methodology offers a unique perspective for researchers and practitioners to view workplace stress as a dynamic process. The portrayal of multiple recursive feedback loops can guide the development of policies and programs within complex organizational contexts with attention both to interactions among causes and avoidance of adverse unintended consequences. While additional research is needed to further test the modeling approach, findings might underscore the need to direct workplace interventions towards changing organizational conditions for nursing aides.","Jetha, Arif; Kernan, Laura; Kurowski, Alicia",0,10.1186/s12913-016-1955-8,49
87,"Stress management and workplace disability in the US, Europe and Japan","Stress Management and Workplace Disability in the US, Europe and Japan: Deborah L. Jones, et al. Department of Psychology, Barry University, USA-Although the health care costs and the number of disability cases across all medical illnesses have increased, disability management programs implementing stress management interventions have been found to improve physical and mental health, reduce costs to employers, and facilitate the reintegration of injured individuals into the work environment. Stress management programs limit the impact and chronicity of disabilities and can be used to reduce and control the cost of disability in the workplace. Providing the most efficacious behavioral interventions thereby allows employers, employees and health professionals to work cooperatively to achieve optimum health and cost effectiveness. This review presents a variety of group and individual interventions, which have been utilized to aid disabled employees in coping with work-related injuries and medical illness. The implementation of stress management interventions in the workplace is described in detail, with special emphasis on the use of cognitive behavioral stress management. Finally, this review outlines a team approach to the application of a workplace stress management intervention aimed at reducing the overall impact of disability.","Jones, DL; Tanigawa, T; Weiss, SM",0,10.1539/joh.45.1,50
88,Workplace interventions for common mental disorders: A systematic meta-review,"Depression and anxiety disorders are the leading cause of sickness absence and long-term work incapacity in most developed countries. The present study aimed to carry out a systematic meta-review examining the effectiveness of workplace mental health interventions, defined as any intervention that a workplace may either initiate or facilitate that aims to prevent, treat or rehabilitate a worker with a diagnosis of depression, anxiety or both. Relevant reviews were identified via a detailed systematic search of academic and grey literature databases. All articles were subjected to a rigorous quality appraisal using the AMSTAR assessment. Of the 5179 articles identified, 140 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 20 were deemed to be of moderate or high quality. Together, these reviews analysed 481 primary research studies. Moderate evidence was identified for two primary prevention interventions; enhancing employee control and promoting physical activity. Stronger evidence was found for CBT-based stress management although less evidence was found for other secondary prevention interventions, such as counselling. Strong evidence was also found against the routine use of debriefing following trauma. Tertiary interventions with a specific focus on work, such as exposure therapy and CBT-based and problem-focused return-to-work programmes, had a strong evidence base for improving symptomology and a moderate evidence base for improving occupational outcomes. Overall, these findings demonstrate there are empirically supported interventions that workplaces can utilize to aid in the prevention of common mental illness as well as facilitating the recovery of employees diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety.

89,"The Effect of a Brief Cognitive Behavioural Stress Management Programme on Mental Status, Coping with Stress Attitude and Caregiver Burden While Caring for Schizophrenic Patients","This experimental study was carried out using a pre-test/post-test control group model to evaluate the effect of a ""Brief Cognitive Behavioural Stress Management Programme"" (BCBSMP) on mental status, coping with stress attitude, and caregiver burden while caring for patients with schizophrenia. A total of 61 caregivers who provided care for schizophrenia patients at a community mental health centre were included in the study. Caregivers were matched according to gender and scale scores and were assigned to either the study or the control group. Before and after the programme, caregivers in both groups were given the ""Demografic Data Form"", ""Zarit Caregiver Burden Scale"", ""Coping Attitude Evaluation Scale"", ""Stress Indicators Scale"", and the ""General Health Survey-28"". Caregivers in the study group were taken to a BCSMP one session per week (each session lasted 120 min) for seven weeks. We determined that the stress indicators, the risk of developing a psychological disorder, and caregiver burden decreased and skills related to both the problem-oriented and emotion-oriented aspects of stress increased in the study group after the programme.","Ata, EE; Dogan, S",1,10.1016/j.apnu.2017.10.004,52
90,Does Targeting Higher Health Risk Employees or Increasing Intervention Intensity Yield Savings in a Workplace Wellness Program?,"Objective: This article aims to test whether a workplace wellness program reduces health care cost for higher risk employees or employees with greater participation. Methods: The program effect on costs was estimated using a generalized linear model with a log-link function using a difference-indifference framework with a propensity score matched sample of employees using claims and program data from a large US firm from 2003 to 2011. Results: The program targeting higher risk employees did not yield cost savings. Employees participating in five or more sessions aimed at encouraging more healthful living had about $20 lower per member per month costs relative to matched comparisons (P = 0.002). Conclusions: Our results add to the growing evidence base that workplace wellness programs aimed at primary prevention do not reduce health care cost, with the exception of those employees who choose to participate more actively.","Kapinos, KA; Caloyeras, JP; Liu, HS; Mattke, S",0,10.1097/JOM.0000000000000570,53
91,The Stress Check Program: a new national policy for monitoring and screening psychosocial stress in the workplace in Japan,"Objectives: The Japanese government launched a new occupational health policy called the Stress Check Program. This program mandates that all workplaces with 50 or more employees conduct the Stress Check Program for workers at least once a year. This article gives a brief overview and critical review of the program. Methods: We reviewed relevant laws, guidelines, and manuals, as well as the policy development process. The policy and the components of the program were compared using available scientific evidence and trends in the management of psychosocial factors at work according to the policies and guidelines of international bodies and European countries. Results: The process of program policy development was based on a discussion among employer and employee representatives, occupational health professionals, and mental health experts. Scientific evidence shows that mandated components of the program (i.e., feedback of stress survey results and physician's interview) may be ineffective. However, additional components recommended to employers, such as stress management skill provision and work environment improvement, in conjunction with the program may be effective in improving psychosocial stress at work. The Stress Check Program is unique compared with the global trend for psychosocial risk management because it focuses on the assessment of stress among individual workers. Conclusion: The new program may be effective in improving worker mental health by facilitating the psychosocial risk management approach in Japan. Concerns regarding the program include mass leakage of collected information, and possible disadvantages for workers labeled as having high stress.","Kawakami, Norito; Tsutsumi, Akizumi",0,,54

94,Effect of a brief training program based on cognitive behavioral therapy in improving work performance: A randomized controlled trial,"Objectives: Efforts to improve performance in the workplace with respect to positive mental health have increased, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has recently attracted attention as an intervention measure to this end. Here, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief training program on CBT for improving work performance of employees. Methods: The participants were employees of an electric company in Japan. The intervention consisted of 1 group session of CBT (120 min) and web-based CBT homework for 1 month. We evaluated employees in both the intervention and control groups at baseline and follow-up after three months. The main outcome was work performance, which was evaluated by a subjective score from 1 to 10. The secondary outcome was self-evaluation of cognitive flexibility. Analyses were conducted based on ITT. Results: In the intervention group, 84 participants attended the group session, with 79 subsequently completing at least 1 instance of online homework. ITT analysis showed that the subjective performance of the intervention group was significantly improved compared with that of the control group (1.47 vs. 0.69, mean difference 0.78 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.05 to 1.51], Cohen's d=0.31). The ability to recognize dysfunctional thinking patterns and change them to positive ones significantly improved in the intervention group compared to the control group (0.71 vs. 0.26, mean difference 0.45 [95% CI 0.06 to 0.83], d=0.33). However, after adjustment for baseline scores, no significant difference was observed. The ability to view a situation from multiple perspectives and expand one's repertoire of thought patterns in the intervention group also significantly improved (0.83 vs. 0.35, mean difference 0.48 [95% CI 0.35 to 0.95], d=0.29), but here again, significance was lost after adjusting for baseline scores. Discussion: Our results suggest that a brief training program that combines a group CBT session with webbased CBT homework improved subjective work performance. In addition, this program might help improve employees' cognitive flexibility.","Kimura, Risa; Mori, Makiko; Tajima, Miyuki; Somemura, Hironori; Sasaki, Norio; Yamamoto, Megumi; Nakamura, Saki; Okanoya, June; Ito, Yukio; Otsubo, Tempei; Tanaka, Katsutoshi",0,10.1539/joh.14-0208-OA,56
95,Psychosomatic and physical responses to a multi-component stress management program among teaching professionals: A randomized study of cognitive behavioral intervention (CB) with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) approach,"Background: The present study aims to assess psychosomatic and physical responses to a multi-component stress management program with the use of CAM and CB approaches among teaching professionals in Hong Kong. Method: A random controlled trial (RCT) was used to compare between CB group (n = 26) and the CAM-CB group (n = 30). Interventions were administered for 1.5 h once a week for eight consecutive weeks. A self-administered questionnaire including perceived stress scale (PSS) and frequency of psychosomatic symptoms were measured at baseline (T1), immediate after the program (T2), and 4 weeks after the program (T3). Physical parameters were measured at T1 and T2. Results: A reduction of 23% in PSS was observed in the CB group, while the CAM-CB group yielded 18% reductions in PSS from T1 to T3 [F(2,108) = 3.099; p = .049]. No significant interactions were observed in the frequency of psychosomatic symptoms and physical parameters. However, a significant downward time trend was observed (p < .001) and larger percentage changes in physical responses were shown in the CAM-CB group than CB group. Conclusion: Clinical evidence of both the CAM-CB and CB program has been demonstrated in the current study and both approaches are easy to be self-implemented. The CAM technique might serve as an alternative choice for self-administered stress management to replace the additional time needed for professional follow-up contacts. It might further improve some physical responses such as handgrip strength and resting heart rate, which are associated with better psychosomatic health and better occupational stress management.

96,Work-related Stress Management by Finnish Enterprises,"Work-related stress has become one of the major problems in working societies and it increases employees' risk of disease. Its importance has been emphasized also due to its' great socio-economic consequences. Different stress management and worksite interventions have been implemented, however, the actual practices in companies have been assessed little. The purpose of this study was to examine how enterprises in Finland manage work-related stress. An assessment of work-related stress methods was conducted in 40 enterprises acting in the metropolitan area of Finland in May 2010 by a questionnaire. The concept of work-related stress was well known by participants. Enterprises rarely had their own work-related stress management protocol even though all of the workplaces had experienced work-related stress at some point. The collaboration between the workplace and occupational health services varied. Companies easily placed the responsibility for work-related stress assessment and handling on occupational health services. Workplaces have to pay more attention to work-related stress and related issues. The easiest way to do this is to collaborate with occupational health services. Protocols for collaboration should be developed jointly using the available models which have been established as cost-effective.","Kinnunen-Amoros, Maritta; Liira, Julia",0,10.2486/indhealth.2013-0178,58
97,Deriving Requirements for Pervasive Well-Being Technology From Work Stress and Intervention Theory: Framework and Case Study,"Background: Stress in office environments is a big concern, often leading to burn-out. New technologies are emerging, such as easily available sensors, contextual reasoning, and electronic coaching (e-coaching) apps. In the Smart Reasoning for Well-being at Home and at Work (SWELL) project, we explore the potential of using such new pervasive technologies to provide support for the self-management of well-being, with a focus on individuals' stress-coping. Ideally, these new pervasive systems should be grounded in existing work stress and intervention theory. However, there is a large diversity of theories and they hardly provide explicit directions for technology design. Objective: The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive and concise framework that can be used to design pervasive technologies that support knowledge workers to decrease stress. Methods: Based on a literature study we identify concepts relevant to well-being at work and select different work stress models to find causes of work stress that can be addressed. From a technical perspective, we then describe how sensors can be used to infer stress and the context in which it appears, and use intervention theory to further specify interventions that can be provided by means of pervasive technology. Results: The resulting general framework relates several relevant theories: we relate ""engagement and burn-out"" to ""stress"", and describe how relevant aspects can be quantified by means of sensors. We also outline underlying causes of work stress and how these can be addressed with interventions, in particular utilizing new technologies integrating behavioral change theory. Based upon this framework we were able to derive requirements for our case study, the pervasive SWELL system, and we implemented two prototypes. Small-scale user studies proved the value of the derived technology-supported interventions. Conclusions: The presented framework can be used to systematically develop theory-based technology-supported interventions to address work stress. In the area of pervasive systems for well-being, we identified the following six key research challenges and opportunities: (1) performing multi-disciplinary research, (2) interpreting personal sensor data, (3) relating measurable aspects to burn-out, (4) combining strengths of human and technology, (5) privacy, and (6) ethics.","Koldijk, S; Kraaij, W; Neerincx, MA",0,10.2196/mhealth.5341,59

While several theoretical perspectives provide insights on this relationship, the literature lacks an integrative framework explaining the relationship. We develop a conceptual model explaining the link between subjective well-being and physiological functioning in the context of work. Integrating positive psychology and occupational stress perspectives, our model explains the relationship between subjective well-being and physiological functioning as a result of the direct influence of subjective well-being on physiological functioning and of their common relationships with work stress and personal resources, both of which are influenced by job conditions.

100,Integrating job stress and workplace mental health literacy intervention: Challenges and benefits,"We developed and implemented an integrated workplace mental health intervention combining job stress intervention with a workplace mental health literacy program. The intervention was evaluated using an uncontrolled design, with organization-wide assessment of working conditions and mental health literacy preintervention, followed by action planning and intervention (up to 1 year), and postintervention assessment 1 year on. No signifi cant changes in the measured working conditions were observed (the â€˜derailmentâ€™); however, signifi cant and sustained improvements in mental health literacy were observed. In comparison to mental health literacy improvements, improvements in psychosocial working conditions are harder to achieve (e.g., require more time and resources, organizational as well as knowledge/attitudes/behaviour change). Integrating these two approaches may provide encouragement/incentives to employers (near-term improvement in mental health literacy) needed to sustain employer interest and commitment to the improvement of psychosocial working conditions (over the longer term). To promote greater employer uptake and more sustained efforts to improve workplace mental health, we offer the three main messages (the â€˜solutionsâ€™).

101,"The Psychosocial Work Environment, Employee Mental Health and Organizational Interventions: Improving Research and Practice by Taking a Multilevel Approach","Although there have been several calls for incorporating multiple levels of analysis in employee health and well-being research, studies examining the interplay between individual, workgroup, organizational and broader societal factors in relation to employee mental health outcomes remain an exception rather than the norm. At the same time, organizational intervention research and practice also tends to be limited by a single-level focus, omitting potentially important influences at multiple levels of analysis. The aims of this conceptual paper are to help progress our understanding of work-related determinants of employee mental health by the following: (1) providing a rationale for routine multilevel assessment of the psychosocial work environment; (2) discussing how a multilevel perspective can improve related organizational interventions; and (3) highlighting key theoretical and methodological considerations relevant to these aims. We present five recommendations for future research, relating to using appropriate multilevel research designs, justifying group-level constructs, developing group-level measures, expanding investigations to the organizational level and developing multilevel approaches to intervention design, implementation and evaluation.

Methods: We analyzed data from two independent surveys of employers (N = 1500) and the general population (N = 4611). Results: Employers reported offering wellness programs at almost twice the rate of employees who reported having these programs available to them. Most (59.4%) employees felt employers should play a role in improving worker health and nearly three-fourths (72.1%) thought that lower insurance premiums should be offered for participation in wellness programs. However, fewer than half felt that their work environment allows them to maintain good health. Conclusion: Although wellness programs are offered at the majority of workplaces in the U.S., employees are unlikely to be aware of these efforts and would like employers to be forthcoming in providing programs promoting good health.","McCleary, K; Goetzel, RZ; Roemer, EC; Berko, J; Kent, K; De La Torre, H",0,10.1097/JOM.0000000000000946,63
103,Investing in mental health and well-being: findings from the DataPrev project,"A systematic review was conducted to determine the extent to which an economic case has been made in high-income countries for investment in interventions to promote mental health and well-being. We focused on areas of interest to the DataPrev project: early years and parenting interventions, actions set in schools and workplaces and measures targeted at older people. Economic evaluations had to have some focus on promotion of mental health and well-being and/or primary prevention of poor mental health through health-related means. Studies preventing exacerbations in existing mental health problems were excluded, with the exception of support for parents with mental health problems, which might indirectly affect the mental health of their children. Overall 47 studies were identified. There was considerable variability in their quality, with a variety of outcome measures and different perspectives: societal, public purse, employer or health system used, making policy comparisons difficult. Caution must therefore be exercised in interpreting results, but the case for investment in parenting and health visitor-related programmes appears most strong, especially when impacts beyond the health sector are taken into account. In the workplace an economic return on investment in a number of comprehensive workplace health promotion programmes and stress management projects (largely in the USA) was reported, while group-based exercise and psychosocial interventions are of potential benefit to older people. Many gaps remain; a key first step would be to make more use of the existence evidence base on effectiveness and model mid- to long-term costs and benefits of action in different contexts and settings.","Mcdaid, David; Park, A-La",0,10.1093/heapro/dar059,64

Participants received questionnaire packets in the mail and 461 (38%) of the employees responded. The results showed that volunteers reported significantly more perceived stress than the nonvolunteers. However volunteers did not report greater frequency or intensity of work stressors, Also, respondents who had participated in past stress training reported less perceived stress than volunteers and significantly more organizational spontaneity behavior than respondents who had not participated in past stress training. These findings suggest that employees who plan to attend stress training have the greatest need and that the stress intervention reduces perceived stress levels and, possibly, affects work behavior.","Munz, DC; Kohler, JM",0,,65

106,Determining Barriers and Facilitators Associated with Willingness to Use a Personal Health Information Management System to Support Worksite Wellness Programs,"Purpose. To determine the barriers and facilitators associated with willingness to use personal health information management (PHIM) systems to support an existing worksite wellness program (WWP). Design. The study design involved a Web-based survey. Setting. The study setting was a regional hospital. Subjects. Hospital employees comprised the study subjects. Measures. Willingness, barriers, and facilitators associated with PHIM were measured. Analysis. Bivariate logit models were used to model two binary dependent variables. One model predicted the likelihood of believing PHIM systems would positively affect overall health and willingness to use. Another predicted the likelihood of worrying about online security and not believing PHIM systems would benefit health goals. Results. Based on 333 responses, believing PHIM systems would positively affect health was highly associated with willingness to use PHIM systems (p <.01). Those comfortable online were 7.22 times more willing to use PHIM systems. Participants in exercise-based components of WWPs were 3.03 times more likely to be willing to use PHIM systems. Those who worried about online security were 5.03 times more likely to believe PHIM systems would not help obtain health goals. Conclusions. Comfort with personal health information online and exercise-based WWP experience was associated with willingness to use PHIM systems. However, nutrition-based WWPs did not have similar effects. Implementation barriers relate to technology anxiety and trust in security, as well as experience with specific WWP activities. Identifying differences between WWP components and addressing technology concerns before implementation of PHIM systems into WWPs may facilitate improved adoption and usage.

Caring in this environment can be complex, challenging and stressful for staff; this can affect the quality of care provided to residents, lead to staff strain and burnout, and increase sickness, absence and turnover rates. It is therefore important to find interventions to increase the wellbeing of staff that will not only benefit staff themselves but also residents and care providers. Mindfulness training is known to be effective in treating a variety of physical and mental health conditions.Methods and design: The study uses mixed methods centred on a stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial. Thirty care homes in Wales are implementing a brief web-based mindfulness training course, starting in random sequence. Four to ten consenting staff from each facility undertake the course and complete validated questionnaires at baseline and after eight and 20 weeks. We shall also interview a stratified sample of ten trained staff and analyse the transcripts thematically. The primary outcome is stress; secondary outcomes include job satisfaction, attitudes towards residents and sickness absence rates.Discussion: With increasing numbers of people living with dementia in care homes and causing stress in their carers, it is important to evaluate support strategies for staff. Mindfulness-based therapies may be of potential benefit and need detailed examination.","Baker, Christine; Huxley, Peter; Dennis, Michael; Islam, Saiful; Russell, Ian",1,10.1186/s12888-015-0703-7,68

We present longitudinal panel data from 869 employees who completed questionnaires at two time points at 13 Australian universities. Our results show that employees who reported an awareness of stress-reduction interventions undertaken at their university scored lower on psychological strain and higher on job satisfaction and commitment than those who were unaware of the interventions. The results suggest that simply the awareness of stress interventions can be linked to positive employee outcomes. The study further revealed that senior management trustworthiness and procedural justice mediate the relationship between awareness and employee outcomes.

Given the unprecedented number of older adults who extend their labor force attachment beyond traditional retirement ages, a new vision of older adults' economic security and overall quality-of-life should take into account the intersections of aging, work, and health. The purpose of this article is to: (a) discuss the workplace as an increasingly important setting that can expand the reach and effectiveness of health promotion efforts; (b) examine current knowledge of barriers and facilitators that can affect older workers' participation in workplace-based HWPs; and (c) suggest new incentive structures that may increase older workers' engagement in these programs. We develop a rationale for our proposition that sustained participation in HWPs may improve the health status of older workers and reduce health care costs.

110,The Inhibition of Cardiovascular Responses to Mental Stress Following Aerobic Exercise,"The effects of exercise on subsequent psychophysiological responses to mental stress were assessed in a study of 30 normotensive male volunteers. Participants were randomly allocated to three experimental conditionsâ€”20â€min exercise at 100 Watts (high exercise), 20â€min exercise at 25 Watts (low exercise), or 20â€min no exercise (control). After a recovery period of 20 min, all subjects performed a mental arithmetic task for four 5â€min trials. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored continuously using a Finapres, and respiration and electrodermal activity were also recorded. Baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate was assessed using power spectrum analysis. Exercise produced consistent increases in systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and subjective tension, together with reductions in systemic resistance and baroreflex sensitivity. The systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate reactions to mental arithmetic were significantly blunted in the high exercise compared with control conditions, with the low exercise group showing an intermediate pattern. Subjective responses to mental stress were unaffected by prior exercise. The pattern of hemodynamic response was not a result of changes in baroreflex sensitivity. The mechanisms underlying this result are discussed in relation to the discrepancies between subjective and physiological responses to mental stress, and the implications for the use of exercise in stress management.

111,"From vitality to vital exhaustion and other states of ""Tense tiredness"": A new biopsychosocial risk domain","Fatigue is a common prodromal symptom for various medical conditions, including acute myocardial infarction. Fatigue is also the core component of vital exhaustion, which consists of a specific triad: excessive fatigue, increased irritability, and feelings of demoralization. In this issue of Psychosomatic Medicine, Frestad and Prescott present a meta-analysis of 16 studies, involving 53,337 participants, which found vital exhaustion to be associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and recurrent cardiac events among individuals with established CHD. After discussing methodological limitations of the studies included in this meta-analysis, we describe these findings in terms of a larger genre of risk that is biopsychosocial in origin and tied to two types of tiredness: ""calm tiredness"" and ""tense tiredness."" The former is regenerative, while the latter enhances disease risk. We propose that besides vital exhaustion, other symptoms of negative affect may combine with tiredness to produce increased clinical risk, such as the presence of depressed mood, an inability to relax or recover after work, and symptoms of burnout. We further propose that vital exhaustion can be considered as part of a larger paradigm, ranging from a positive state of vitality to a negative state of exhaustion of vitality. We conclude this editorial by emphasizing the importance of improving vitality and the need to clarify biobehavioral mechanisms that play a role in the association between vital exhaustion and adverse CHD outcomes. New interventions are needed that target reducing exhaustion and improving vitality for individuals at high risk of CHD.

112,The role of qualitative research in adding value to a randomised controlled trial: lessons from a pilot study of a guided e-learning intervention for managers to improve employee wellbeing and reduce sickness absence,"Background: Despite the growing popularity of mixed-methods studies and considerable emphasis on the potential value of qualitative research to the trial endeavour, there remains a dearth of published studies reporting on actual contribution. This paper presents a critically reflective account of our experience of the actual value of undertaking qualitative research alongside a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial of a guided e-learning intervention for managers in an NHS Mental Health Trust to improve employee wellbeing and reduce sickness absence.For the qualitative study we undertook 36 in-depth interviews with key informants, managers and employees. We observed and took in-depth field notes of 10 meetings involving managers and employees at the Trust, and the two qualitative researchers acted as participant observers at steering committee and monthly research team meetings. We adopted a narrative methodological orientation alongside a thematic approach to data analysis, eliciting a rich account of the complexities of managing stress at work.Results: We identified two key overarching roles played by the qualitative research: 'problematising' and 'contextualising'. Specifically, the qualitative data revealed and challenged assumptions embedded in the trial about the nature of the learning process, and exposed the slippery and contested nature of abstracted variables, on which a trial depends. The qualitative data challenged the trial's logic model, and provided a rich understanding of the context within which the trial and intervention took place.Conclusions: While acknowledging the ever-present tension in mixed-methods research between the requirements of quantitative research to represent the social world as abstracted variables, and the goal of qualitative research to explore and document the complexity of social phenomena, we adopted a pragmatic position that enabled us to engage with this tension in a productive and partially integrative way. Our critically reflective account of the praxis of integration illuminated opportunities and challenges for maximising the value of qualitative research to a trial. This paper sets out tangible illustrative lessons for other mixed-methods researchers endeavouring to get the most from qualitative research.","Russell, Jill; Berney, Lee; Stansfeld, Stephen; Lanz, Doris; Kerry, Sally; Chandola, Tarani; Bhui, Kamaldeep",0,10.1186/s13063-016-1497-8,73
114,Supporting direct care workers in dementia care: Effects of a psychoeducational intervention,"An experimental study using a pre-posttest control group design was conducted to assess the effects of a person-centered care-based psychoeducational intervention on direct care workers' stress, burnout, and job satisfaction. The intervention aimed to develop person-centered care competences and tools for stress management. Four aged care facilities were randomly assigned to a psychoeducational or an education-only intervention (control). Data were collected from 56 direct care workers (female, mean age 44.72 Â± 9.02) through measurements of burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory), job satisfaction (Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire-short form), and stress (Perceived Stress Scale) and focus-group interviews. Results showed significant positive effects in emotional exhaustion (P =.029) and positive but no significant effects in stress and job satisfaction. According to qualitative data, the experimental group perceived enhanced group cohesion, emotional management, and self-care awareness. Psychoeducational interventions may contribute to reduce direct care workers' burnout. Further work is needed to determine the extent of its benefits.

115,Effects of a Psychoeducational Intervention for Direct Care Workers Caring for People with Dementia,"This study aimed to assess the effects of a psychoeducational intervention, designed to improve direct care workers' stress, burnout and job satisfaction, and person-centered communicative behavior in people with dementia. A pretest-posttest control group design was conducted in 4 aged-care facilities. Two experimental facilities received a psychoeducational intervention, and 2 control facilities received an education only. Data were gathered from 53 care workers at baseline, immediately, and 6 months after the intervention, through self-administrated instruments and video-recorded morning care sessions. The experimental group showed a significant decrease in care workers' burnout and a significant improvement in several communicative behaviors (eg, involvement). Stress levels deteriorated at 6 months, and no intervention effects were found for job satisfaction. The findings highlight the importance of providing care workers with both technical competences and tools for stress management, as this might be associated with a reduction in their levels of exhaustion and improved communicative behaviors.

116,Evaluating an Organizational-Level Occupational Health Intervention in a Combined Regression Discontinuity and Randomized Control Design,"Organizational-level occupational health interventions have great potential to improve employees' health and well-being. However, they often compare unfavourably to individual-level interventions. This calls for improving methods for designing, implementing and evaluating organizational interventions. This paper presents and discusses the regression discontinuity design because, like the randomized control trial, it is a strong summative experimental design, but it typically fits organizational-level interventions better. The paper explores advantages and disadvantages of a regression discontinuity design with an embedded randomized control trial. It provides an example from an intervention study focusing on reducing sickness absence in 196 preschools. The paper demonstrates that such a design fits the organizational context, because it allows management to focus on organizations or workgroups with the most salient problems. In addition, organizations may accept an embedded randomized design because the organizations or groups with most salient needs receive obligatory treatment as part of the regression discontinuity design.

117,Job stress interventions and the organization of work,"Interventions that aim at improving health by changing the organization of work-in terms of task characteristics, work conditions, and social aspects-have shown their potential, but results are mixed, and many studies do not use their methodological potential. It is proposed that interventions at the organizational level are likely to have a more diverse effect than at the individual level, as the number of subsystems, with potentially diverging interests, is larger. Even well-implemented interventions are not likely to lead to improvements in all parameters for all participants, and trade-offs have to be considered. Methodological improvement is necessary but should not only focus on design issues, but also on careful documentation and subgroup analyses. A combination of person-focused and organization-focused approaches is the most promising. Finally, evidence points to the limited utility of economic arguments for the acceptance of health promotion projects; the necessity of professional trust is therefore emphasized.","Semmer, NK",0,10.5271/sjweh.1056,77
118,Cross-country discrepancies on public understanding of stress concepts: Evidence for stress-management psychoeducational programs,"Background: Negative effects of stress have pose one of the major threats to the health and economic well being of individuals independently of age and cultural background. Nevertheless, the term ""stress"" has been globally used unlinked from scientificevidence-based meaning. The discrepancies between scientific and public stress knowledge are focus of concern and little is know about it. This is relevant since misconceptions about stress may influence the effects of stress-management psychoeducational programs and the development of best practices for interventions. The study aimed to analyze stress knowledge among the Canadian and Brazilian general public and to determine the extent to which scientific and popular views of stress differ between those countries. Methods: We evaluated 1156 healthy participants between 18 and 88 years of age recruited from Canada (n = 502) and Brazil (n = 654). To assess stress knowledge, a questionnaire composed of questions regarding stress concepts (""stress is bad"" versus ""stress-free life is good"") and factors capable of triggering the stress response (""novelty, unpredictability, low sense of control and social evaluative threat versus ""time pressure,work overload, conflict, unbalance and children"") was used. Results: Both Canadian and Brazilian participants showed misconceptions about stress and the factors capable of triggering a stress response. However, the rate of misconceptions was higher in Brazil than in Canada (p < 0.05). Conclusion: These findings suggest a lack of public understanding of stress science and its variance according to a country's society. Psychoeducational programs and vulnerability of stress-related disorder are discussed.

119,Mindfulness at Work,"This chapter explores how sociocultural factors influence the cultivation, and maintenance, of mindfulness and work. It begins by acknowledging that scholarly work in the area has been strongly influenced by an 'epidemic' of work stress and the desire to find systematic ways to ameliorate its harmful effects. Mindfulness has received a considerable amount of research attention in the past decade and led to the development of a vast literature. Indeed, the literature now boasts numerous meta-analytic and systematic reviews on the use of mindfulness within an array of contexts. Self-determination theory (SDT) is a macro-theory of human motivation and personality development. Whilst the six mini-theories that comprise SDT address different aspects of motivational and personality processes, at its core is the proposition that human beings have a set of universal, fundamental psychological needs, the satisfaction of which are essential for healthy development, vital engagement, effective behaving, and psychological well-being.

120,Mindfulness-Based Mind Fitness Training: An Approach for Enhancing Performance and Building Resilience in High-Stress Contexts,"This chapter examines a novel approach to mindfulness training, optimized for high-stress contexts, called Mindfulness-based Mind Fitness Training (MMFT).Â® MMFT follows in the lineage of warrior traditions that train the body and mind to cultivate two foundational warrior qualities-wisdom and bravery. Wisdom is the ability to see clearly how things are right now and then to use that information to make the most effective choice in the moment. Bravery is the ability to stay present with any experience, even an extremely difficult one, without needing for it to be different. Together, these two qualities are a pathway toward effective action in any sphere, but especially in high-stress environments. In line with this lineage, MMFT cultivates attentional control and tolerance for challenging experience-two capacities important for enhancing performance and building resilience in high-stress contexts. This chapter examines some of the possible mechanisms by which MMFT may enhance performance and build resilience, while ameliorating the detrimental effects of such environments. Next, it summarizes the empirical research to date about MMFT, with troops preparing for combat deployments. Finally, it compares MMFT to other approaches for cultivating mindfulness.

121,A Japanese Stress Check Program screening tool predicts employee long-term sickness absence: a prospective study,"Objectives: On December 1, 2015, the Japanese government launched the Stress Check Program, a new occupational health policy to screen employees for high psychosocial stress in the workplace. As only weak evidence exists for the effectiveness of the program, we sought to estimate the risk of stress-associated long-term sickness absence as defined in the program manual. Methods: Participants were 7356 male and 7362 female employees in a financial service company who completed the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ). We followed them for 1 year and used company records to identify employees with sickness absence of 1 month or longer. We defined high-risk employees using the BJSQ and criteria recommended by the program manual. We used the Cox proportional regression model to evaluate the prospective association between stress and long-term sickness absence. Results: During the follow-up period, we identified 34 male and 35 female employees who took long-term sickness absence. After adjustment for age, length of service, job type, position, and post-examination interview, hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident long-term sickness absence in high-stress employees were 6.59 (3.04-14.25) for men and 2.77 (1.32-5.83) for women. The corresponding population attributable risks for high stress were 23.8% (10.3-42.6) for men and 21.0% (4.6-42.1) for women. Conclusions: During the 1-year follow-up, employees identified as high stress (as defined by the Stress Check Program manual) had significantly elevated risks for long-term sickness absence.","Tsutsumi, A; Shimazu, A; Eguchi, H; Inoue, A; Kawakami, N",0,10.1539/joh.17-0161-OA,81

123,Determining factors for stress perception assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4) in Spanish and other European samples,"Objective: Stress perception depends on cultural and social aspects that vary from one country to another. One of the most widely disseminated methods of assessing psychological stress is the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-4). Therefore, in order to identify these factors and their impact on mental health, the present study compares the PSS-4 results among three European countries (Great Britain, France and Spain). This study focuses on PSS-4 results within a Spanish sample to determine: (1) normative data, reliability and validity of PSS-4 in a Spanish sample and (2) how stress perception changes depending on cultural and social factors. Methods: The data were obtained from a website representing a service of a smoking cessation program, the study represented a service that was open to all individuals. The number of participants were 37,451. They reported their age, gender, nationality, marital status, education and employment status, and completed two psychological questionnaires (PPS-4 and the anxiety and depression scales of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, SCL 90-R). Results: The PSS-4 scores could differentiate between relevant sociodemographic variables (such as sex, age, nationality, marital status, education, parental status, employment status, and income class). The PSS-4 scores showed a positive correlation with the SCL 90-R anxiety and depression scales. The normed values for interpreting the PSS-4 scores are presented. The PSS-4 showed adequate internal consistency and reliability. Conclusions: The PSS-4 is a useful instrument for assessing stress perception levels in the general population in different countries. Its internal consistency is sufficient for a 4-item scale.

126,In the search for integrative biomarker of resilience to psychological stress,"Psychological resilience can be defined as individual's ability to withstand and adapt to adverse and traumatic events. Resilience is traditionally assessed by subjective reports, a method that is susceptible to self-report bias. An ideal solution to this challenge is the introduction of standardised and validated physiological and/or biological predictors of resilience. We provide a summary of the major concepts in the field of resilience followed by a detailed critical review of the literature around physiological, neurochemical and immune markers of resilience. We conclude that in future experimental protocols, biological markers of resilience should be assesses both during baseline and during laboratory stressors. In the former case the most promising candidates are represented by heart rate variability and by in vitro immune cells assay; in the latter caseâ€”by startle responses (especially their habituation) during stress challenge and by cardiovascular recovery after stress, and by cortisol, DHEA and cytokine responses. Importantly, they should be used in combination to enhance predictive power.

127,"Acceptability, Feasibility, and Efficacy of a Workplace Mindfulness Program for Public Sector Employees: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial with Informant Reports","Mindfulness training appears to reduce stress and distress, but little is known about whether it results in changes that can be observed by colleagues, family, or friends or its appropriateness as a workplace stress management intervention for a large and distributed public sector workforce. This study evaluated a pilot 5-week Mindfulness at Work Program (MaWP) for acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy in relation to stress and related mental health and productivity problems for public sector employees. A parallel group randomized controlled trial compared the MaWP intervention (n = 20) with an information-only control (n = 100). Exploratory qualitative and quantitative methods were used to assess changes observed by informants (n = 63). Results suggest a high degree of acceptability, although location and inflexible work schedules presented feasibility obstacles. Compared with the control, the primary outcome of mindfulness improved for MaWP participants (d = 0.57, p < 0.001), as did perceived stress (d = 0.97, p < 0.001), psychological distress (d = 0.61, p < 0.001), health-related quality of life (d = 0.51, p = 0.002), and social functioning (d = 0.08, p = 0.019). All secondary outcomes were at least partly mediated by changes in mindfulness. The intervention thus appears to have potential merit as a workplace intervention for public sector employees across a range of outcomes. Obtaining informant observations was feasible and while qualitative analyses indicated positive changes that supported self-reported outcomes, quantitative analyses returned ambiguous results. A seven-item scale adapted from a popular self-report mindfulness scale for use by informants showed promise, but further work is needed to establish validity, reliability, and scalability of this method of assessing observable changes following mindfulness training.

128,Well-Being in Health Professionals: Positive Psychology at Work,"This chapter reviews research on well-being among health professionals and suggests a positive psychology framework based on both a hedonic and eudaimonic well-being perspective, which may serve as a positive psychology guideline for research in the health care setting. Researchers are taking increasing interest in resources, potentials, competencies and positive states of health personnel. The chapter focuses on issues such as job satisfaction, work engagement, self-determination, or autonomy, job crafting, mindfulness, resilience, and empowerment. Self-acceptance is a main criterion of mental health as well as self-actualization, the fully functioning person and maturity. From the positive psychology point of view, the eudaimonic approach is a good reference model for exploring well-being in the health workforce, because it is linked with professional personality development. In oncology and emergency settings, health professionals are particularly exposed to traumatic events, which can cause tremendous emotional stress. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

129,Employee assistance programs: A review of the management of stress and wellbeing through workplace counselling and consulting,"Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) provide counselling and consulting services that focus on the prevention and/or remediation of personal problems experienced by employees, or members of their families. EAPs are currently considered one of the main vehicles for occupational stress management and are rapidly evolving into providers of holistic wellbeing programs in the workplace. This form of service delivery has, however, been criticised for focusing interventions at the individual rather than at the organisational level. This review examines the history and development of Australian EAPs, discusses issues unique to the delivery of psychological services in a workplace environment, and considers evidence for the effectiveness of EAPs. While research evidence is not fully supportive of the effectiveness of EAPs, data suggests that these programs do impact positively on employee mental health, and are perceived by employees as a desirable workplace resource.","Kirk, AK; Brown, DF",0,10.1080/00050060310001707137,87
130,Working on wellness (WOW): A worksite health promotion intervention programme,"Background: Insufficient PA has been shown to cluster with other CVD risk factors including insufficient fruit and vegetable intake, overweight, increased serum cholesterol concentrations and elevated blood pressure. This paper describes the development of Working on Wellness (WOW), a worksite intervention program incorporating motivational interviewing by wellness specialists, targeting employees at risk. In addition, we describe the evaluation the effectiveness of the intervention among employees at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Methods: The intervention mapping (IM) protocol was used in the planning and design of WOW. Focus group discussions and interviews with employees and managers identified the importance of addressing risk factors for CVD at the worksite. Based on the employees' preference for individual counselling, and previous evidence of the effectiveness of this approach in the worksite setting, we decided to use motivational interviewing as part of the intervention strategy. Thus, as a cluster-randomised, controlled control trial, employees at increased risk for CVD (N = 928) will be assigned to a control or an intervention group, based on company random allocation. The sessions will include motivational interviewing techniques, comprised of two face-to-face and four telephonic sessions, with the primary aim to increase habitual levels of PA. Measures will take place at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes include changes in nutritional habits, serum cholesterol and glucose concentrations, blood pressure and BMI. In addition, healthcare expenditure and absenteeism will be measured for the economic evaluation. Analysis of variance will be performed to determine whether there were significant changes in physical activity habits in the intervention and control groups at 6 and 12 months. Discussion: The formative work on which this intervention is based suggests that the strategy of targeting employees at increased risk for CVD is preferred. Importantly, this study extends the work of a previous, similar study, Health Under Construction, in a different setting. Finally, this study will allow an economic evaluation of the intervention that will be an important outcome for health care funders, who ultimately will be responsible for implementation of such an intervention.","Kolbe-Alexander, TL; Proper, KI; Lambert, EV; van Wier, MF; Pillay, JD; Nossel, C; Adonis, L; Van Mechelen, W",0,10.1186/1471-2458-12-372,88
131,Impact of a workplace stress reduction program on blood pressure and emotional health in hypertensive employees,"Objectives: This study examined the impact of a workplace-based stress management program on blood pressure (BP), emotional health, and workplace-related measures in hypertensive employees of a global information technology company. Design: Thirty-eight (38) employees with hypertension were randomly assigned to a treatment group that received the stress-reduction intervention or a waiting control group that received no intervention during the study period. The treatment group participated in a 16-hour program, which included instruction in positive emotion refocusing and emotional restructuring techniques intended to reduce sympathetic nervous system arousal, stress, and negative affect, increase positive affect, and improve performance. Learning and practice of the techniques was enhanced by heart rate variability feedback, which helped participants learn to self-generate physiological coherence, a beneficial physiologic mode associated with increased heart rhythm coherence, physiologic entrainment, parasympathetic activity, and vascular resonance. BP, emotional health, and workplace-related measures were assessed before and 3 months after the program. Results: Three months post-intervention, the treatment group exhibited a mean adjusted reduction of 10.6 mm Hg in systolic BP and of 6.3 mm Hg in diastolic BP. The reduction in systolic BP was significant in relation to the control group. The treatment group also demonstrated improvements in emotional health, including significant reductions in stress symptoms, depression, and global psychological distress and significant increases in peacefulness and positive outlook. Reduced systolic BP was correlated with reduced stress symptoms. Furthermore, the trained employees demonstrated significant increases in the work-related scales of workplace satisfaction and value of contribution. Conclusions: Results suggest that a brief workplace stress management intervention can produce clinically significant reductions in BP and improve emotional health among hypertensive employees. Implications are that such interventions may produce a healthier and more productive workforce, enhancing performance and reducing losses to the organization resulting from cognitive decline, illness, and premature mortality.","McCraty R., Atkinson M., Tomasino D.",0,10.1089/107555303765551589,89

Thirty-six experimental studies were included, representing 55 interventions. Total sample size was 2,847. Of the participants, 59% were female, mean age was 35.4, and average length of intervention was 7.4 weeks. The overall weighted effect size (Cohen's d) for all studies was 0.526 (95% confidence interval = 0.364, 0.687), a significant medium to large effect. Interventions were coded as cognitive-behavioral, relaxation, organizational, multimodal, or alternative. Analyses based on these subgroups suggested that intervention type played a moderating role. Cognitive-behavioral programs consistently produced larger effects than other types of interventions, but if additional treatment components were added the effect was reduced. Within the sample of studies, relaxation interventions were most frequently used, and organizational interventions continued to be scarce. Effects were based mainly on psychological outcome variables, as opposed to physiological or organizational measures. The examination of additional moderators such as treatment length, outcome variable, and occupation did not reveal significant variations in effect size by intervention type.

135,Primary and secondary effects of parenting and stress management interventions for parents of children with developmental disabilities: A meta-analysis,"A meta-analysis of the group intervention research for parents of children with developmental disabilities was conducted in order to characterize the efficacy of treatments in reducing depressive symptoms and other forms of psychological distress associated with stress in parents of children with developmental disabilities. An extensive search led to the identification of 17 studies which were divided into three categories for comparative purposes: parenting education studies usually based on behavioral parent training, coping skills education studies based primarily on cognitive behavioral training, and studies that combined these methods along with other support services. Studies were rated for the quality of the research designs and of the reports. Consistent positive benefits were found in the form of reductions in parents' distress, and these effects were comparable to those reported in other syntheses of parenting interventions for parents of children without disabilities. The studies were evaluated in order to assess whether or not they met standards for established evidence-based practices. On the basis of the quality and number of the randomized trials, we present evidence to support the claim that there are established evidence-based interventions for reducing psychological distress at least in middle-class mothers in the short term. The interventions for fathers are promising as are the data on somewhat longer-term effects. The need for replications with a more diverse group of parents and longer-term follow-up were discussed. Multiple component interventions addressing both parent well-being and behavioral parent training were significantly more effective than either behavioral parent training or cognitive behavioral training along.

137,A mindfulness-based stress management program and treatment with omega-3 fatty acids to maintain a healthy mental state in hospital nurses (Happy Nurse Project): Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Background: It is reported that nursing is one of the most vulnerable jobs for developing depression. While they may not be clinically diagnosed as depressed, nurses often suffer from depression and anxiety symptoms, which can lead to a low level of patient care. However, there is no rigorous evidence base for determining an effective prevention strategy for these symptoms in nurses. After reviewing previous literature, we chose a strategy of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids and a mindfulness-based stress management program for this purpose. We aim to explore the effectiveness of these intervention options for junior nurses working in hospital wards in Japan. Methods/Design: A factorial-design multi-center randomized trial is currently being conducted. A total of 120 nurses without a managerial position, who work for general hospitals and gave informed consent, have been randomly allocated to a stress management program or psychoeducation using a leaflet, and to omega-3 fatty acids or identical placebo pills. The stress management program has been developed according to mindfulness cognitive therapy and consists of four 30-minute individual sessions conducted using a detailed manual. These sessions are conducted by nurses with a managerial position. Participants allocated to the omega-3 fatty acid groups are provided with 1,200 mg/day of eicosapentaenoic acid and 600 mg/day of docosahexaenoic acid for 90 days. Discussion: An effective preventive intervention may not only lead to the maintenance of a healthy mental state in nurses, but also to better quality of care for inpatients.

138,A MODEL PROGRAM - STRESS MANAGEMENT UNIT - A CLINIC RUN BY ARMY NURSES,"People suffering from stress and stress-related disorders are a great challenge to our already depleted military health care system. Early identification and separation of soldiers not able to adjust, immediate intervention for temporarily stressed soldiers, and stress management for dependents and retirees help decrease visits to military hospitals and clinics. Immediate intervention for salvageable soldiers also helps improve work performance and productivity. A Stress Management Unit has been open for two years at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), Texas. This article identifies the need for stress management clinics in the military and briefly describes the nurse-run program at BAMC.","WHITE, LS; DELACRUZ, J",0,,96
139,"Stress management intervention at the workplace: Results of a randomized controlled trial [StressbewÃ¤ltigungsintervention am Arbeitsplatz: Ergebnisse einer randomisierten, kontrollierten Studie]","Background: Occupational stress is considered a major risk factor for a wide range of health outcomes. To examine long-term effects on perceived stress reactivity a randomized controlled trial [1 year after stress management intervention (SMI)] was implemented in a metal working plant. Method: A total of 174 participants were randomly assigned to an intervention (IG) or a waiting control group (CG) and underwent a group-based program over 2 days, followed by 2-3 h booster sessions. The primary endpoint was perceived stress reactivity (Stress Reactivity Scale, SRS), while secondary endpoints were anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS), salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase. Results: SRS scores decreased in both groups. A two factor ANOVA proved greater reduction in the IG. For SRS, the effect size (Cohen's d) after 1 year was d=0.416 in the IG and d=0.166 in the CG. Alpha-amylase as a measure of sympathetic nervous system activation decreased more strongly in the IG. Reduction of depression and anxiety was higher in the IG but did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: The conducted SMI is effective over a longer period in reducing perceived stress reactivity and sympathetic activation.

141,Joint effect of chronic medical illness and burnout on depressive symptoms among employed adults,"Objective: Chronic medical illnesses (CMIs) are prevalent in nearly half the working population and are associated with a two-fold risk for developing depression. Burnout is a chronic affective state comprised of symptoms of emotional exhaustion, physical fatigue, and cognitive weariness. It is an outcome of depletion of energetic resources resulting from prolonged exposure to work and life stresses. Building upon the Conservation of Resources theory (Hobfoll, 1989), this prospective study was designed to test the hypothesis that CMI interacts with burnout to facilitate the development of depressive symptoms. Method: Participants were 4,861 employed men and women, aged 19 to 67 years, who came for routine health examinations and were followed for 18 months on average. Forty-seven percent reported having one or more diagnosed CMIs. Results: Burnout was found to predict an increase in depressive symptoms in apparently healthy individuals. Furthermore, the coexistence of burnout in employees with a CMI accelerates the process of developing depressive symptoms within a relatively short period. Burnout was also found to be associated with intensification of preexisting depressive symptoms in employees suffering from different chronic medical conditions (other than cancer), independent of medical comorbidities and other potent confounding variables. Conclusions: Among employees, coexistence of burnout and at least one CMI predicts an increase in depressive symptoms with time. Health care professionals should be made aware of such at-risk employees and follow and manage them closely.

142,Real-time Imaging of Stress-induced Cardiac Autonomic Adaptation During Realistic Force-on-force Police Scenarios,"Operational stress is a complex matter. It requires a better understanding based on scientific knowledge of the psychophysiology of stress to improve training methods for officerâ€™s survival and prevention of post-traumatic stress disorders. This study aimed to assess the reliability and sensitivity of heart rate and of heart rate variability (HRV) as possible objective methods to quantify police operational stress (OS) in the real world and to differentiate the contribution of overlapping physical stress (PhS) during realistic training scenarios. 12-lead ECG of 113 police officers (POs) were continuously monitored during rest, daily activity (control state), and during 172 realistic tactical training scenarios requiring the use of force and/or of shooting firearms (OS, with or without associated PhS). Baseline physiological and psychological measurements were collected on the days of the training session. POs behavior and tactical outcome were rated by police instructors and documented with multiple video cameras. Real-time imaging of tactical stress was tempted with time-varying (TV) spectral HRV analysis (HRVa). Quantitative estimates of time-domain (TD), frequency-domain (FD), and nonlinear HRV parameters were computed from standard (300 and 120 seconds) and very short-term (60 and 30 seconds) intervals. The study was approved by a local Institutional Review Board. TV spectral HRVa provided dynamic imaging of transient cardiac autonomic adaptation induced by OS and/or PhS. Quantitative estimation of the majority of TD and FD HRV parameters were not significantly affected by shortening the length of the explored time-segments from 300 to 30 seconds, as demonstrated by the intraclass correlation coefficient analysis (> 0.70). Discrimination analysis of HRV parameters allowed a differentiation between rest and stress conditions and between mental and physical stress. HRVa provides dynamic imaging and quantification of transient stress-induced autonomic adaptation in police officers during realistic tactical training scenarios.

144,Leadership and Employee Well-being,"Leadership/people management can impact on employee well-being in multiple ways, from causing stress to enhancing positive well-being and engagement, modeling healthy behavior, and supporting those suffering ill health, to name a few. This chapter focuses particularly on three aspects of the leadership-employee well-being relationship: how leadership affects employee stress levels and exposure to psychosocial hazards; the relevance of leadership for sickness absence and facilitation of employee return to work following long-term sickness absence; and the role of leadership in engendering employee engagement. It also reviews the literature regarding leadership development as a mechanism for improving employee well-being. Further research into leadership development looking at well-being outcomes is another potentially rich field, particularly in exploring the complexity of mediating variables and how different formats of development intervention impact on all elements of the picture.

146,The prevention of musculoskeletal complaints: a randomized controlled trial on additional effects of a work-related psychosocial coaching intervention compared to physiotherapy alone,"Research shows that psychosocial factors play a significant role on the emergence of musculoskeletal complaints (MSC). The aim of this study was to determine whether a coaching intervention which was focussed on enabling better strategies for coping with work stressors is superior to physiotherapy alone in the reduction of MSC.68 nurses were randomized to an intervention group (IG, n = 34) or a control group (CG, n = 34). The IG and CG completed a weekly individual physiotherapy unit (10 weeks). Additionally, the IG passed five coaching sessions (fortnightly), plus one opening and one closing session. The primary outcome was MSC, secondary outcomes were work ability and work-related wellbeing. Outcomes were obtained by physical examinations and questionnaires. Data were analyzed by t-test, Chi-Square test, ANOVA with repeated measurements, and multilevel analyzes.In respect of MSC, the IG compared to the CG showed a significant improvement in the pain severity of everyday movements, and trends towards an improvement of movement in the vertebral column as well as a reduction of the pain severity due to maximum degree movements. No effects were observed in respect to muscle strengths, and restrictions of everyday activities. The IG exhibited a significant improvement of work ability in reference to the physical working demands, and work-related wellbeing. Analysis indicates that improvements in the IG increased further in the 12 weeks after the intervention.The results suggest that the coaching, beyond physiotherapy, can support the reduction of MSC, the improvement of work ability and work-related wellbeing.","Becker, Annette; Angerer, Peter; Mueller, Andreas",1,10.1007/s00420-017-1202-6,103
147,Dimensional structure and course of post-traumatic stress symptomatology in World Trade Center responders,"Background Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in response to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster of 11 September 2001 (9/11) is one of the most prevalent and persistent health conditions among both professional (e.g. police) and non-traditional (e.g. construction worker) WTC responders, even several years after 9/11. However, little is known about the dimensionality and natural course of WTC-related PTSD symptomatology in these populations. Method Data were analysed from 10 835 WTC responders, including 4035 police and 6800 non-traditional responders who were evaluated as part of the WTC Health Program, a clinic network in the New York area established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were used to evaluate structural models of PTSD symptom dimensionality; and autoregressive cross-lagged (ARCL) panel regressions were used to examine the prospective interrelationships among PTSD symptom clusters at 3, 6 and 8 years after 9/11. Results CFAs suggested that five stable symptom clusters best represent PTSD symptom dimensionality in both police and non-traditional WTC responders. This five-factor model was also invariant over time with respect to factor loadings and structural parameters, thereby demonstrating its longitudinal stability. ARCL panel regression analyses revealed that hyperarousal symptoms had a prominent role in predicting other symptom clusters of PTSD, with anxious arousal symptoms primarily driving re-experiencing symptoms, and dysphoric arousal symptoms primarily driving emotional numbing symptoms over time. Conclusions Results of this study suggest that disaster-related PTSD symptomatology in WTC responders is best represented by five symptom dimensions. Anxious arousal symptoms, which are characterized by hypervigilance and exaggerated startle, may primarily drive re-experiencing symptoms, while dysphoric arousal symptoms, which are characterized by sleep disturbance, irritability/anger and concentration difficulties, may primarily drive emotional numbing symptoms over time. These results underscore the importance of assessment, monitoring and early intervention of hyperarousal symptoms in WTC and other disaster responders.

149,"EFFECTS OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL-MEDITATION PROGRAM ON STRESS REDUCTION, HEALTH, AND EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT - A PROSPECTIVE-STUDY IN 2 OCCUPATIONAL SETTINGS","Despite the high cost of occupational stress, few studies have empirically documented effective methods far alleviating stress and promoting employee development. This three-month prospective study evaluated the effects of the Transcendental meditation (TM) technique on stress reduction, health and employee development in two settings in the automotive industry: a large manufacturing plant of a Fortune 100 corporation, and a small distribution sales company. Employees who learned TM were compared to controls similar in worksite, job position, demographic, and pretest characteristics. Regular meditators improved significantly more than controls (with irregular meditators scoring in between) on multiple measures of stress and employee development, including: reduced physiological arousal (measured by skin conductance levels) during and outside TM practice; decreased trait anxiety, job tension, insomnia and fatigue, cigarette and hard liquor use; improved general health (and fewer health complaints); and enhanced employee effectiveness, job satisfaction, and work/personal relationships. Principal components analysis identified three factors underlying this wide range of improvements through TM: ''occupational coherence,'' ''physiological settledness,'' and ''job and life satisfaction.'' The ''effect size'' of TM in reducing skin conductance, trait anxiety, alcohol/cigarette use, and in enhancing personal development (relative to the control condition) in these business settings was substantially larger than for other forms of meditation and relaxation reported in four previous statistical meta-analyses.","ALEXANDER, CN; SWANSON, GC; RAINFORTH, MV; CARLISLE, TW; TODD, CC; OATES, RM",0,10.1080/10615809308248383,106

Methods: White-collar employees representing 22 different work units were assessed before and after a 1-year intervention program. Subjective ratings on health and work environment, biologic markers, absenteeism, and productivity were measured. Results: Significant improvements in performance feedback, participatory management, employeeship, skills development, efficiency, leadership, employee well-being, and work-related exhaustion were identified. The restorative hormone testosterone increased during the intervention and changes correlated with increased overall organizational well-being. Absenteeism decreased and productivity improved. Conclusions: Fact-based psychosocial workplace interventions are suggested to be an important process for enhancing employee well-being as well as organizational performance.","Anderzen, I; Arnetz, BB",0,10.1097/01.jom.0000167259.03247.1e,107
151,The Disconnected Values Model Improves Mental Well-Being and Fitness in an Employee Wellness Program,"This study examined the effect of a 10-week wellness program on changes in physical fitness and mental well-being. The conceptual framework for this study was the Disconnected Values Model (DVM). According to the DVM, detecting the inconsistencies between negative habits and values (e.g., health, family, faith, character) and concluding that these odisconnectso are unacceptable promotes the need for health behavior change. Participants were 164 full-time employees at a university in the southeastern U.S. The program included fitness coaching and a 90-minute orientation based on the DVM. Multivariate Mixed Model analyses indicated significantly improved scores from pre- to post-intervention on selected measures of physical fitness and mental well-being. The results suggest that the Disconnected Values Model provides an effective cognitive-behavioral approach to generating health behavior change in a 10-week workplace wellness program.","Anshel, MH; Brinthaupt, TM; Kang, M",0,10.1080/08964289.2010.489080,108
153,Techno-stress: A prospective psychophysiological study of the impact of a controlled stress-reduction program in advanced telecommunication systems design work,"There is a void of studies concerning occupational health aspects from working with the most advanced forms of information technologies techniques such as are found in some of the world-renowned telecommunication systems development laboratories. However, many of these techniques will later be applied in the regular office environment. We wanted to identify some of the major stressors perceived by advanced telecommunication systems design employees and develop a valid and reliable instrument by which to monitor such stressors. We were also interested in assessing the impact of a controlled prospective stress-reduction program on perceived mental stress and specific psychophysiological parameters. A total of 116 employees were recruited. Sixty-one were offered to participate in one of three stress-reduction training programs (intervention group). The additional 50 functioned as a reference group. After a detailed baseline assessment, including a comprehensive questionnaire and psychophysiological measurements, new assessments were made at the end of the formal training program (+3 months) and after an additional 5-month period. Results reveal a significant improvement in the intervention group with regard to circulating levels of the stress-sensitive hormone prolactin as well as art attenuation in mental strain. Cardiovascular risk indicators were also improved. Circulating thrombocytes decreased in the intervention group. Type of stress-reduction programs chosen and intensity of participation did not significantly Impact results. Coping style was not affected and no beneficial effects were observed with regard to the psychological characteristics of the work, eg intellectual discretion and control over work processes. The survey instrument is now being used in the continuous improvement of work processes and strategic leadership, of occupational health issues. The results suggest that prior psychophysiological stress research, based on low- and medium-skill, rather repetitive kinds of jobs, may not be completely applicable to that of skilled professionals. The results indicate that cutting-edge telecommunication systems design employees suffer from significant amounts of mental strain. In addition, there are limited but mensurable benefits from a stress-reduction program. More attention should be directed as do how to design healthy and productive work environments in workplaces using advanced information technologies.","Arnetz, BB",0,10.1097/00043764-199601000-00017,109
154,Employee assistance programmes: the emperor's new clothes of stress management?,"The employee assistance programme (EAP) is a benefit increasingly provided by UK employers that claims to reduce the effects of 'stress' on individuals and organisations, provide a 'management tool' to improve workplace performance and productivity, and respond to critical incidents. Although the marketing literature describes services as workplace-based counselling, there is evidence to suggest what they actually offer is consultation, assessment, referral and short-term treatment to clients experiencing a wide range of serious psychological and mental health difficulties. This article describes EAPs, their history, development and operation, and reviews the evidence to support their claims for effectiveness. Because employee distress is often the result of an interaction between organisational and individual factors, the role and claims of EAPs as organisational interventions are also critically examined.","Arthur, AR",0,10.1080/03069880020004749,110
155,Perceived military organizational support and peacekeeper distress: A longitudinal investigation,"Many professions vital to the safety of society require workers to face high magnitude and potentially traumatizing events. Because this routine exposure can cause high levels of stress in workers, it is important to investigate factors that contribute to both risk of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and healthy responses to stress. Although some research has found social support to mitigate the effects of posttraumatic stress symptoms, scant research has investigated organizational support. The aim of the present study is to investigate the temporal relationship between stress symptoms and perceived organizational support in a sample of 1,039 service members deployed to the peacekeeping mission to Kosovo. Participants completed self-report measures of stress symptoms and perceived organizational support at 4 study time points. Bivariate latent difference score structural equation modeling was utilized to examine the temporal relationship among stress and perceived organizational support. In general, across the 4 time points, latent PCL scores evidenced a salient and negative relationship to subsequent POS latent difference scores. However, no significant relationship was found between latent POS variables and subsequent PCL latent difference scores. Findings suggest that prior stress symptoms are influencing service member's perceptions of the supportiveness of their organization such that increased prior stress is associated with worsening perceptions of support. These results illustrate that targeting stress directly may potentiate the positive influence of organizational support and that institutional support programs should be adapted to better account for the negative biases increased distress may encourage.

156,The Impact of an Innovative Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program on the Health and Well-Being of Nurses Employed in a Corporate Setting,"This study implemented an innovative new model of delivering a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program that replaces six of the eight traditional in-person sessions with group telephonic sessions (tMBSR) and measured the program's impact on the health and well-being of nurses employed within a large health care organization. As part of a nonrandomized pre-post intervention study, 36 nurses completed measures of health, stress, burnout, self-compassion, serenity, and empathy at three points in time. Between baseline (Time 1) and the end of the 8-week tMBSR intervention (Time 2), participants showed improvement in general health, t(37) = 2.8, p <.01, decreased stress, t(37) = 6.8, p <.001, decreased work burnout, t(37) = 4.0, p <.001, and improvement in several other areas. Improvements were sustained 4 months later (Time 3), and individuals who continued their MBSR practice after the program demonstrated better outcomes than those that did not. Findings suggest that the tMBSR program can be a low cost, feasible, and scalable intervention that shows positive impact on health and well-being, and could allow MBSR to be delivered to employees who are otherwise unable to access traditional, on-site programs.

160,"Effects of a stress management intervention program on self-perceived depression, anxiety, and stress among hotel employees: A quasi-experimental study","Employees with high levels of distress are subject to greater health risks, productivity loss, low morale, and increased costs compared to those with normal distress levels. To address this, a work-site stress management intervention program (SMIP) must be able to reduce distress levels and engage individuals so that ultimately employees' psychosocial well-being is improved and the organisation's productivity increases. In this quasi-experimental study, our primary objective was to implement and evaluate the effects of a SMIP among hotel employees. A total of 126 hotel employees from two hotels (A & B) were assigned to the experimental group (Hotel A) (n = 68) and control group (Hotel B) (n = 58), respectively. The experimental group was given the SMIP whilst the control group was given a talk on stress management only. The SMIP consisted of three sessions: (a) deep breathing and progressive muscular relaxation exercises; (b) cognitive behavioral training (CBT) covering communication & interpersonal skills; and (c) emotional intelligence at work, goal setting and changing dysfunctional thought patterns. A validated Malay short version of the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scales (DASS21) was self-administered before (Pre) and after (Post 1 and Post 2) each intervention for both experimental and control groups. Time and group interaction effects were calculated using a mixed within-between subjects ANOVA analysis. There were significant interactions between intervention program type and time, for stress, anxiety and depression. There were substantial main effects for time for the intervention group but not for the control for stress, anxiety and depression. There were no significant reductions in stress, anxiety and depression scores in the control group at post 1 and 2. The main effects comparing the two types of intervention were significant for anxiety but not for stress and depression. This suggests that there was no difference in the effectiveness of the two types of intervention with respect to reducing stress and depression levels but the SMIP was effective in the reduction of anxiety levels among hotel employees. These findings suggest that the SMIP is effective in reducing the anxiety levels, but not stress and depression levels, among hotel employees. The limitations, recommendations needed for future research and implications conclude the article. Â© 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

161,Increasing physical activity in office workers - the Inphact Treadmill study; a study protocol for a 13-month randomized controlled trial of treadmill workstations,"Background: Sedentary behaviour is an independent risk factor for mortality and morbidity, especially for type 2 diabetes. Since office work is related to long periods that are largely sedentary, it is of major importance to find ways for office workers to engage in light intensity physical activity (LPA). The Inphact Treadmill study aims to investigate the effects of installing treadmill workstations in offices compared to conventional workstations.Methods/Design: A two-arm, 13-month, randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted. Healthy overweight and obese office workers (n = 80) with mainly sedentary tasks will be recruited from office workplaces in Umea, Sweden. The intervention group will receive a health consultation and a treadmill desk, which they will use for at least one hour per day for 13 months. The control group will receive the same health consultation, but continue to work at their regular workstations. Physical activity and sedentary time during workdays and non-workdays as well as during working and non-working hours on workdays will be measured objectively using accelerometers (Actigraph and activPAL) at baseline and after 2, 6, 10, and 13 months of follow-up. Food intake will be recorded and metabolic and anthropometric variables, body composition, stress, pain, depression, anxiety, cognitive function, and functional magnetic resonance imaging will be measured at 3-5 time points during the study period. Interviews with participants from the intervention group will be performed at the end of the study.Discussion: This will be the first long-term RCT on the effects of treadmill workstations on objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time as well as other body functions and structures/morphology during working and non-working hours among office workers. This will provide further insight on the effects of active workstations on our health and could fill in some of the knowledge gaps regarding how we can reduce sedentary time in office environments.","Bergman, Frida; Boraxbekk, Carl-Johan; Wennberg, Patrik; Sorlin, Ann; Olsson, Tommy",1,10.1186/s12889-015-2017-6,117
162,Preventing sickness absenteeism among employees with common mental disorders or stress-related symptoms at work: Design of a cluster randomized controlled trial of a problem-solving based intervention versus care-as-usual conducted at the Occupational Health Services,"Background: Common mental disorders (CMDs) are among the leading causes of sick leave in Sweden and other OECD countries. They result in suffering for the individual and considerable financial costs for the employer and for society at large. The occupational health service (OHS) can offer interventions in which both the individual and the work situation are taken into account. The aim of this paper is to describe the design of a study evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention given at the OHS to employees with CMDs or stress-related symptoms at work. In addition, intervention fidelity and its relation to the outcome will be assessed in a process analysis. Methods: The study is designed as a cluster randomized trial in which the participating OHS consultants are randomized into either delivering the intervention or performing care as usual. Employees with CMDs or stress-related symptoms at work are recruited consecutively by the OHS consultants. The intervention aims to improve the match between the employee and the job situation. Interviews are held individually with the employee and the nearest supervisor, after which a joint meeting with both the employee and the supervisor takes place. A participatory approach is applied by which the supervisor and the employee are guided by the OHS consultant and encouraged to actively take part in problem solving concerning the work situation. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and at six and 12 months. A long-term follow-up at 3 years will also be performed. The primary outcome is registered sickness absence during a 1-year period after study inclusion. Secondary outcomes are mental health and work ability. The interventionâ€™s cost effectiveness, compared to treatment as usual, both for society and for the employer will be evaluated. A process evaluation by both the OHS consultants and the employee will be carried out. Discussion: The study includes analyses of the effectiveness of the intervention (clinical and economic) as well as an analysis of its implementation at the participating OHSs. Possible methodological challenges such as selection bias and risk of contamination between OHS consultants delivering the experimental condition and consultants giving usual care are discussed.

163,"A comprehensive workplace intervention and its outcome with regard to lifestyle, health and sick leave: The AHA study","This study is a prospective multicentre cohort study entitled Work and Health in the Processing and Engineering Industries, the AHA Study (AHA is the Swedish abbreviation for the study). Four large workplaces in Sweden participated during the years from 2000 to 2003. The present report has two objectives: (1) to present a comprehensive occupational health intervention programme and (2) to evaluate this programme with a focus on lifestyle (smoking and exercise), health related quality of life (HRQoL) and sick leave. Interventions were provided on an individual and group level, including evidence-based methods for four health/focus areas (individual level) and a group intervention based on a survey-feedback methodology. The analyses in this report were exclusively employed at an organizational level. The proportion of smokers decreased at three companies and the course of the HRQoL was advantageous at two of the companies as compared to a gainfully employed reference group. A significant decrease in sick leave was revealed at one company, whereas a break in an ascending sick-leave trend appeared at a second company as compared to their respective corporate groups. This comprehensive workplace intervention programme appears to have had positive effects on smoking habits, HRQoL and sick leave.","Bergstrom, Gunnar; Bjorklund, Christina; Fried, Ingegard; Lisspers, Jan; Nathell, Lennart; Hermansson, Ulric; Helander, Anders; Bodin, Lennart; Jensen, Irene B.",1,,119
164,Relationship Between Physical Inactivity and Health Characteristics Among Participants in an Employee-Wellness Program,"Objective: To characterize factors associated with physical inactivity among employees with access to workplace wellness program. Methods: We examined data on physical inactivity, defined as exercise less than once a week, from the 2010 health risk assessment completed by employees at a major academic institution (N = 16,976). Results: Among employees, 18% of individuals reported physical activity less than once a week. Individuals who were physically inactive as compared with physically active reported higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.36 [1.23 to 1.51]), fair or poor health status (AOR, 3.52 [2.97 to 4.17]), and absenteeism from work (AOR, 1.59 [1.41 to 1.79]). Overall, physically inactive employees as compared with physically active employees reported more interest in health education programs. Conclusion: Future research is needed to address barriers to physical inactivity to improve employee wellness and potentially lower health utility costs.","Birdee, GS; Byrne, DW; McGown, PW; Rothman, RL; Rolando, LA; Holmes, MC; Yarbrough, MI",0,10.1097/JOM.0b013e31827f37d7,120
165,Autopsy of a Failure: Evaluating Process and Contextual Issues in an Organizational-Level Work Stress Intervention,"The difficulties associated with the evaluation of organizational-level work stress interventions are notorious yet little attention has been paid to the reasons why they fail. This case study took place in a department of 205 employees from a private company where an intervention was developed but poorly implemented. This paper scrutinizes the intervention to understand why it was poorly implemented and examine its effects on employees. Qualitative data (field notes and interviews with managers) was used to evaluate the intervention. Questionnaires (n = 125, n = 94, 60 full-completers) were used to evaluate the level of implementation and its effects. Results suggest partial implementation might have a detrimental effect on commitment. Poor implementation could be accounted for by the changing organizational context, low ownership of stakeholders, and flaws in the intervention design. Considering the process and context of interventions is essential to understand their effects.","Biron, C; Gatrell, C; Cooper, CL",0,10.1037/a0018772,121
166,Interventions Following a Critical Incident: Developing a Critical Incident Stress Management Team,"This article describes the development and implementation of a stress management model for assisting hospital staff after critical incidents using an adaptation of Mitchell's model (J. Mitchell, 1983). A survey was conducted following the first major incident using M. Horowitz, N. Wilner, and W. Alvarez's (1979) Impact of Event Scale 10 days after and again 6 weeks following the incident to measure its emotional impact on staff. Outcomes included being symptom-free of critical incident stress after a 3-month period. The interventions were intended to help staff at a large metropolitan multispecialty hospital in Queensland in the immediate period following critical incidents. The implications of this program indicated the importance of emotional support at critical times for health professionals. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

167,Specific dance movement therapy interventions-Which are successful? An intervention and correlation study,"This intervention study examined the correlation between specific DMT interventions and the improvement in quality of life, stress management, and stress reduction. Dance therapists (. N=. 11) completed 970 Intervention Checklist 1 (specific interventions at the individual level) and 120 Intervention Checklist 2 (specific interventions at the group level) reports during the course of 10 treatment sessions. The scores denoted by each therapist on the Intervention Checklists were compared with the scores of each client in the treatment group (. N=. 97) on standardized questionnaires. The successful therapists applied a self-selected approach and combined in-depth DMT approaches with specific interventions. These findings demonstrated the relationship between clients' improvement in quality of life, coping, reduction of stress and the use of psychodynamic-oriented DMT, the Chace approach, the combination of directive and non-directive leadership styles, and interpersonal closure. The clients who performed dance improvisation, spatial synchrony, synchrony in effort and who received focused treatment sessions exhibited improved daily life and decreased somatization symptoms. These results indicate that specific DMT interventions were associated with an improvement in well-being, whereas other DMT interventions should be used cautiously until further research demonstrates their effectiveness. Additional successful DMT interventions must be identified in future studies. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",BrÃ¤uninger I.,0,10.1016/j.aip.2014.08.002,123
168,Evaluation of an Occupational Mindfulness Program for Staff Employed in the Disability Sector in Australia,"Employees in the disability sector are subject to a range of stressors in the work place, and it is important that employers provide stress-management interventions to optimize coping and psychological wellbeing of these staff. The purpose of this preliminary study was to evaluate the impact of a group-based training program, known as 'Occupational Mindfulness' (OM), on employee coping and wellbeing within a disability service in Australia. The study involved a longitudinal observational design. Thirty-four participants (22 managers and 12 disability support workers, aged 23 to 60 years) completed a range of mindfulness and psychological wellbeing measures prior to commencement of the OM training program and immediately following completion of the program. The program was positively evaluated by participants and found to be associated with significant increases in positive affect and the mindfulness facet of observing. In contrast, extrinsic job satisfaction decreased significantly from baseline to post-training, while negative affect, perceived stress, anxiety and negative emotional symptoms increased significantly. Depressive state, intrinsic job satisfaction, general job satisfaction, satisfaction with life, burnout, compassion satisfaction, compassion fatigue, compassion for others, self compassion and the four mindfulness facets of describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience and non-reactivity to inner experience did not change significantly from baseline to post-training. Participants reported enhanced awareness of signs and sources of stress, and positive changes in self-care attitudes and behaviours and interactions with clients and colleagues. Reasons for the seemingly paradoxical findings of highly favourable participant evaluation of the OM training program alongside increases in perceived stress, anxiety, negative emotional symptoms and negative affect and decreases in job satisfaction immediately following the program are discussed. Overall, the OM program yielded a range of benefits to participants and holds significant potential to be transferred to other work settings in the future.

169,Statistical considerations in the interpretation of research on occupational stress management interventions,"Considerable research effort has been conducted into evaluating occupational stress management interventions (SMIs) that target individual workers. We consider several factors central to the interpretation of such research. Specifically, we survey 27 published SMI reports taking into account (1) the amount and detail of descriptive information provided in respect to sample characteristics and intervention procedures; (2) the level of statistical power evident in study designs; (3) whether studies are reductionist, in that they target specific workers experiencing elevated levels of strain, or preventive in that they are available to allcomers, regardless of initial strain levels; (4) whether statistically significant change where it occurs is meaningful in real-world (or clinical) terms, and reliable in measurement terms. We also outline recommendations for descriptive data and statistical considerations to be included in planning and interpreting SMI research. Our conclusion is that stress management researchers should attend to those factors to a far greater extent. At present the quality of reporting and research design is such that it is difficult to form an impression of what type of SMI is appropriate to whom, and in what circumstances.","Bunce, D; Stephenson, K",0,10.1080/02678370010016126,125
170,Stress management and innovation interventions at work,"A study among health-care workers is reported where a traditional stress management program (n = 66) was compared with an intervention promoting innovation at work as a form of stress management (n = 52), and a control group (n = 84). Measures relating to both the process of participation in the respective interventions, and outcome in terms of psychological well-being were taken. The traditional program, emphasizing cognitive-behavioral and arousal reduction techniques, was associated with improvements in general psychological strain and job satisfaction. The intervention promoting innovative responses to stressors (e.g., changing work methods, modifying working relations with colleagues) was associated with improvements in work-related stress, and innovation. Statistical analysis suggested session process variables, in addition to the theoretical orientations of the respective interventions, were associated with outcome variance. Follow-up data, 1 year post-intervention, suggested short-term gains on outcome variables relating to psychological well-being were not maintained. However, increases in levels of innovation, although not apparent post-intervention (3 months), were significant after 1 year. It is concluded that stress management research should focus more on process variables, and that interventions promoting innovation at work, show some promise in addressing occupational strain.","Bunce, D; West, MA",0,10.1177/001872679604900205,126
171,Evaluation of a Comprehensive Employee Wellness Program at an Organization With a Consumer-Directed Health Plan,"Objective: Consumer-directed health plans (CDHPs) are popular among employers in the United States. This study examined an employee wellness program and its association with employee health in an organization that recently initiated a CDHP. Methods: This retrospective observational analysis compared the health risks, employer-paid health care costs, and short-term disability absences of employees of a large financial services corporation from 2009 to 2010. Results: The two-time health risk appraisal participants had a significant improvement in the percentage of employees in the overall low-risk category. The average annual employer-paid medical and pharmacy costs did not significantly change. For employees who improved their health risk category, there was a commensurate change in costs and absences. Conclusions: In a difficult economic climate, this organization began a health promotion program for employees as well as a new CDHP benefit structure. No short-term reduction in health care usage or overall health status was observed.","Burton, WN; Chen, CY; Li, XQ; Schultz, AB; Kasiarz, D; Edington, DW",0,10.1097/JOM.0000000000000121,127
172,Employee stress levels and the intention to participate in a worksite smoking cessation program,"This study examines the nature and extent of the relationship between stress levels and intentions to participate in a worksite smoking cessation program among male current smokers (n = 220) employed in an automobile manufacturing plant. A plantwide survey was conducted which measured job stress, nonjob stress, smoking behavior, and intent to participate. The results of polychotomous logistic regressions suggest that among the current smokers in this plant, job and nonjob stress were positively associated with workers' intentions to participate in a worksite smoking cessation program. Thus, contrary to the popular notion that stress diminishes the motivation to quit, employees under high levels of stress may be most receptive to educational interventions intended to persuade smokers to commit to quitting.","Chan, WF; Heaney, CA",0,10.1023/A:1025565013675,128
173,A Controlled Pilot Evaluation of Acceptance and Commitment Training for Intellectual Disability Staff,"The present study pilot tested a mindfulness and acceptance-based work stress reduction intervention for intellectual disability staff. The intervention combined Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT) with instruction in applied behavior analysis. This combined intervention was compared to a control condition consisting of applied behavior analysis training only. Considering both distressed and nondistressed participants, between-group differences were observed only for participants who reported that they had been consistently applying the techniques they had learned. In addition, ACT group participants with higher levels of psychological distress at pretest showed greater reductions in psychological distress from pretest to follow-up when compared to their control group counterparts. A concurrent decrease in the believability of burnout-related thoughts was observed in the ACT group from pretest to follow-up, relative to the control group. These results support and extend previous research on ACT interventions for intellectual disability staff.

174,Intimate Partner Violence and Welfare Participation: A Longitudinal Causal Analysis,"This longitudinal study examined the temporal-ordered causal relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV), five mental disorders (depression, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, panic attack, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), alcohol abuse/dependence, drug abuse/dependence, treatment seeking (from physician, counselor, and self-help group), employment, child support, and welfare participation. It was a secondary data analysis of records of 571 women; the records were extracted from the study ""Violence Against Women and the Role of Welfare Reform"" (VAWRWR). Results from generalized estimating equations (GEE) showed that experiencing controlling behaviors reduced likelihood of welfare participation whereas experiencing physical abuse increased it. Significant impact on welfare participation was wielded by panic attack, drug abuse/dependence, and employment; treatment seeking and child support made no significant impact. The study found no significant mediating effect wielded by panic attack, drug abuse/dependence, employment, or child support on welfare participation's relationship to controlling behaviors or physically abusive behaviors experienced. Implications for intervention are discussed. Â© The Author(s) 2012.",Cheng T.C.,0,10.1177/0886260512455863,130
175,Dancing between Theory and Practice: Enhancing Work Engagement through Work Stress Intervention,"This quasi-experimental and longitudinal study assesses the effectiveness of a work stress intervention (i.e., Team Redesign) to increase job and personal resources and to consequently reduce job strain and increase employee psychosocial well-being in an enamel manufacturing company following the Resources-Experiences-Demands Model (RED Model) and within the Action-Research approach. The sample consisted of 108 employees at Time 1 and 72 employees at Time 2. Repeated-measures multivariable analysis of variance (MANOVA) showed that the Time x Intervention interaction had reliable, positive, and incremental effects on job resources (i.e., innovation climate), personal resources (i.e., professional self-efficacy and perceived competence), and motivational outcomes (i.e., work engagement, vigor, and dedication) on the intervention group (laboratory team, n = 9) when compared with the control group (n = 63 employees from different departments). Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications based on the RED Model, including the feedback from Intervention (Action) to Theory (Research).

176,The integration of studio cycling into a worksite stress management programme,"High stress is a prevalent problem in the worksite. To reduce stress, improve productivity, reduce absenteeism, and lower healthcare costs, many companies offer exercise classes or stress management programmes. Although physical activity is an important component of stress management, few worksites have integrated physical activity into their comprehensive stress reduction programmes. The purpose of this single-arm pilot project was to examine the potential effectiveness of an integrated exercise (studio cycling) and cognitive-behavioural stress management programme. Eighty-four adults, 75% female, mostly aged 40+years, participated in an integrated 12-week cycling studio and cognitive-behavioural stress management programme. Participants experienced a significant and clinically meaningful reduction on the Perceived Stress Scale (p<0.01), rating of current stress level and confidence to manage stress at the programme's end and at a 1-month follow-up. Participants also reported having significantly improved overall health, improved nutritional habits, higher physical activity level, greater confidence in their ability to follow a healthy diet, higher spiritual well-being, improved sleep, receiving more support for maintaining healthy living and improved quality of life at the completion of the 12-week programme and 1-month follow-up. These findings provide further support for an integrated exercise and stress management programme. Copyright Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

177,Emotional intelligence in social work,"Abstract copyright data collection owner.The aim of this research project was to examine the relationship between Emotional Intelligence, stress, burnout and social work practice and also assess whether Emotional Intelligence training for social workers would reduce their burnout rates and improve their practice over time. The study design used a Randomised Control Trial over 12 months collecting quantitative data at 6 time points, two before the Emotional Intelligence Training and 4 after the Emotional Intelligence Training. Twenty-five percent of participants also took part in a qualitative interview. 207 Child and family social workers took part in the study from eight local authorities in the UK.Project description:This interdisciplinary project examines whether emotional intelligence helps professionals in emotionally demanding jobs such as social work to perform well and whether it helps them to manage their anxiety and stress. Emotional intelligence indicates how good someone is at understanding how emotions work, recognising emotions in themselves, recognising emotions in others, managing their own emotions and managing emotions in others. This project aims to assess the influence of Emotional Intelligence (EI) training for social workers in relation to burnout and performance using a randomised control trial. It also aims to produce a psychometric measure of social work performance created from the perspective of social workers, managers, service users and educators. The three year study has four phases: (1) a literature review and focus groups will identify items which tap into behavioural characteristics of social worker performance; (2) will validate a social work performance measure created from phase 1; (3) an emotional intelligence intervention will be designed using elements from existing EI programmes which show effects on outcomes; (4) a randomised control trial will evaluate an emotional intelligence training intervention for social workers and assess its effect on social work performance and stress.

178,Organisational interventions,"Within developed economies, work-related psychological stress represents a significant burden to employees, organisations, and society. In light of these substantial costs, there is a clear requirement for comprehensive stress prevention and management programs. Despite this acknowledged requirement, there is a disproportionate focus on interventions targeting individual workers, relative to interventions targeting organisational sources of stress, in the published research literature. Furthermore, published examples of organisational interventions have been predominantly conducted in Europe and the US, where labour conditions differ markedly from those within the Asia-Pacific region. This chapter will provide an overview of organisational intervention research, with a specific focus on issues relating to the development, implementation, and evaluation of organisational interventions within the Asia-Pacific region. Two case studies reflecting successful organisational intervention programs conducted in Japan and Australia will be presented. Finally, challenges associated with implementing organisational interventions will be discussed, with a specific focus on potential solutions for overcoming these challenges and directions for future research within the Asia-Pacific region.

179,From distress guidelines to developing models of psychosocial care: Current best practices,"Psychological distress has been recognized as having a significant effect upon cognitive and emotional functioning, quality of life, and in some populations increased costs of care. Screening for distress and provision of psychosocial care in oncology treatment settings has been identified as a future accreditation standard by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC). Because there are few available models of programs of distress screening and referral to inform oncology social workers and other members of the psychosocial support team with planning their own programs, this article seeks to provide exemplars of best practices that are currently in place in four different settings where psychosocial support is provided to people living with cancer and their families. Each program will provide an overview of how it was successfully established and its contribution toward evolving evidence-informed best practices.

Methods: Using a randomized controlled trial design, 309 working adults were randomly assigned to the web-based condition or to a wait control condition. All participants were assessed on multiple selfreported outcomes at pretest and Posttest. Results: Relative to controls, the web-based group reduced their stress, increased their knowledge of depression and anxiety, developed more positive attitudes toward treatment, and adopted a more healthy approach to alcohol consumption., Conclusions: Wefound that a brief and easily adaptable web-based stress management program can simultaneously reduce worker stress and address stigmatized behavioral health problems by embedding this prevention material into a more positive stress management framework.","Billings, Douglas W.; Cook, Royer F.; Hendrickson, April; Dove, David C.",0,10.1097/JOM.0b013e31816c435b,136
181,Evaluating organizational-level work stress interventions: Beyond traditional methods,"Since the early 1990s, there has been a growing literature on organizational-level interventions for work-related stress, and associated calls for such interventions to be evaluated. At the same time, doubts have been expressed about the adequacy of traditional scientific research methods in applied psychology (the natural science paradigm) in providing an effective framework for such evaluations. This paper considers some of the philosophical and methodological issues raised by evaluation research in relation to organizational-level interventions for work-related stress. Four key issues are discussed: the concept of a study being ""fit for purpose"" in relation to research designs and the nature of acceptable evidence; the issue of control of research conditions in real-world studies; the need to evaluate process as well as outcome, including the interrelated nature of process and outcome; and the interpretation of imperfect evidence sets. The starting point of this paper is the reality of organizational life, which is complex and continually changing. Its main objective is not to offer an alternative to a scientific approach but to argue for a more broadly conceived and eclectic framework for evaluation that acknowledges the limitations of the traditional approach. It espouses an approach that is reflective of the reality of organizational life and in which the methods used for evaluating an intervention are fit for purpose. The paper concludes by offering an outline framework for this broader approach to the evaluation of interventions.

182,Evaluation of a biofeedback-assisted meditation program as a stress management tool for hospital nurses: A pilot study,"Objective: To assess whether a self-directed, computer-guided meditation training program is useful for stress reduction in hospital nurses. Design: We prospectively evaluated participants before and after a month-long meditation program. The meditation program consisted of 15 computer sessions that used biofeedback to reinforce training. Participants were instructed to practice the intervention for 30 minutes per session, four times a week, for four weeks. Visual analogue scales were used to measure stress, anxiety, and quality of life (assessments were performed using Linear Analogue Self-Assessment [LASA], State Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI], and Short-Form 36 [SF-36] questionnaires). Differences in scores from baseline to the study's end were compared using the paired t test. Results: Eleven registered nurses not previously engaged in meditation were enrolled; eight completed the study. Intent-to-treat analysis showed significant improvement in stress management, as measured by SF-36 vitality subscale (P = .04), STAI (P = .03), LASA stress (P = .01), and LASA anxiety (P = .01). Nurses were highly satisfied with the meditation program, rating it 8.6 out of 10. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study suggest the feasibility and efficacy of a biofeedback-assisted, self-directed, meditation training program to help hospital nurses reduce their stress and anxiety. Optimal frequency of use of the program, as well as the duration of effects, should be addressed in future studies.

183,Development of a Logic Model for a Physical Activity-Based Employee Wellness Program for Mass Transit Workers,"Transportation workers, who constitute a large sector of the workforce, have worksite factors that harm their health. Worksite wellness programs must target this at-risk population. Although physical activity is often a component of worksite wellness logic models, we consider it the cornerstone for improving the health of mass transit employees. Program theory was based on in-person interviews and focus groups of employees. We identified 4 short-term outcome categories, which provided a chain of responses based on the program activities that should lead to the desired end results. This logic model may have significant public health impact, because it can serve as a framework for other US mass transit districts and worksite populations that face similar barriers to wellness, including truck drivers, railroad employees, and pilots. The objective of this article is to discuss the development of a logic model for a physical activity based mass-transit employee wellness program by describing the target population, program theory, the components of the logic model, and the process of its development.","Das, BM; Petruzzello, SJ; Ryan, KE",0,10.5888/pcd11.140124,139
184,STRETCHING AND JOINT MOBILIZATION EXERCISES REDUCE CALL-CENTER OPERATORS' MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT AND FATIGUE,"AIM: We sought to evaluate musculoskeletal discomfort and mental and physical fatigue in the call-center workers of an airline company before and after a supervised exercise program compared with rest breaks during the work shift.INTRODUCTION: This was a longitudinal pilot study conducted in a flight-booking call-center for an airline in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Occupational health activities are recommended to decrease the negative effects of the call-center working conditions. In practice, exercise programs are commonly recommended for computer workers, but their effects have not been studied in call-center operators.METHODS: Sixty-four call-center operators participated in this study. Thirty-two subjects were placed into the experimental group and attended a 10-min daily exercise session for 2 months. Conversely, 32 participants were placed into the control group and took a 10-min daily rest break during the same period. Each subject was evaluated once a week by means of the Corlett-Bishop body map with a visual analog discomfort scale and the Chalder fatigue questionnaire.RESULTS: Musculoskeletal discomfort decreased in both groups, but the reduction was only statistically significant for the spine and buttocks (p=0.04) and the sum of the segments (p=0.01) in the experimental group. In addition, the experimental group showed significant differences in the level of mental fatigue, especially in questions related to memory Rienzo,#181ff and tiredness (p=0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results demonstrate that appropriately designed and supervised exercise programs may be more efficient than rest breaks in decreasing discomfort and fatigue levels in call-center operators.","de Castro Lacaze, Denise Helena; Sacco, Isabel de C.

185,Stress management interventions: what do managers actually do?,"Presents a report of research which surveyed managers' views on stress, their beliefs about stress interventions and who should be responsible for addressing job-related stress problems. Stress management interventions have embedded in them a range of practices that offer opportunities for individual development and employee wellbeing. Equally, though, there is a strongly-held belief that many interventions fall short, because they offer only a partial solution or fail to recognize the wider contextual-structural issues within which organisational behaviour takes place. One reason for this may be that little attempt has been made to find out what managers understand by stress and the extent to which they think that their organisation has a responsibility to address problems of stress. Both qualitative and quantitative techniques were used to explore these issues, using a sample of 540 New Zealand managers. The results draw attention to a number of issues including: do managers' views of stress reflect acknowledged definitions? Who should assume responsibility for managing stress? What do managers mean when they indicate that an intervention is effective? Are stress interventions any different from standard human resource practices and is there a role for theory in stress interventions?.","Dewe, P; O'Driscoll, M",0,10.1108/00483480210416847,141
187,Reducing Stress to Minimize Injury: The Nation's First Employee Assistance Program for Dairy Farmers,"This commentary describes the nation's first Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for dairy farmers. It discusses (1) the significant financial strain and emotional stress experienced by Vermont's dairy farmers reaching dangerous levels; (2) the effect of stress and anxiety on workplace safety; and (3) the highly effective role of an EAP in reducing stress. The commentary depicts the Farm First program model of prevention and early intervention services for dairy farmers that include short-term solution-focused counseling, resources, and referrals to help farmers address the stressors they confront daily. The Farm First program mitigates depression, anxiety, financial and legal problems, family issues, and other stressors on farms that are correlated with accidents, on-the-job injuries, disability, and harm to self or others. EAPs specifically have been shown to reduce on-the-job injuries by reducing employee stress. Ultimately the program has seen good usage commensurate with that at any place of employment. Further, in addition to seeking help for themselves, a number of farmers have used this management consultation service to obtain assistance with farm worker issues. Although the authors have not systematically studied this approach, it shows promise and the authors encourage its duplication and further study in other states.","Dickens, S; Dotter, E; Handy, M; Waterman, L",0,10.1080/1059924X.2014.911637,142
188,Using work stress measurement to develop and implement a TQM programme: a case of counter clerks in Serbian Post,"Every concept of total quality management depends on the appropriate actions of people involved in the business. Managers usually pay attention to what should be done, ignoring how their actions or directives could affect their colleagues' behaviour or their feelings. The model proposed in this paper puts employees' mental health in the centre of attention in order to design and implement a TQM programme. First of all, the parameters of the observed business process in a specific company should be defined. The actual condition of each parameter should be assessed by analysing the stress level of employees. With further analysis, conclusions can be reached about the exact part of the organisation where improvement should be done. Hence, the use of this model can help companies to achieve a successful and sustainable business. In this paper, work stress index (WSI) and employee dissatisfaction index (EDI) are defined in order to quantify employees' stress level caused by work conditions and employee's dissatisfaction about some aspects of the business process. WSI and EDI also give the possibility to compare different companies, various departments in a company or business parameters between themselves. The proposed model has been tested and verified through a research carried out at Serbian Post.","Dobrodolac, M; Markovic, D; Cubranic-Dobrodolac, M; Denda, N",0,10.1080/14783363.2012.704280,143
189,Evaluation of a Participatory Risk Management Work Stress Intervention,"This study evaluated the effects of a participatory risk management intervention in an Australian public sector organization. In this quasi-experimental cohort study, intervention workgroups attended capacity-building workshops and developed and implemented action plans to reduce work and organizational stress risk factors (e.g., job design, performance management, work quality, and organizational change) and stress outcomes (e.g., work stress, morale, and sickness absence duration). There were 5 intervention and 17 control workgroups. An existing organizational development survey of work conditions and well-being was administered as a risk assessment and evaluation tool. Data were collected before the intervention (Time 1 [T1], Intervention n = 94, Control n = 511) and 12 months after (Time 2 [T2], Intervention, n = 123, Control n = 556). Multivariate analysis of variance showed a Group (Intervention vs. Control) x Time (T1 vs. T2) interaction effect with significant improvements for job design, training and development, and morale; and marginal effects for quality and positive performance management. Positive organizational change was not significant. Organizational sickness absence duration decreased, which is consistent with an intervention effect. Results were quite robust against competing explanations (i.e., changing cohorts), although regression to the mean could explain improvements in morale. Top management commitment and support, worker participation, and action plan implementation appeared","Dollard, MF; Gordon, JA",0,10.1037/a0035795,144
190,Stress prevention and management: A challenge for patients and physicians,"Chronic stress is now the commonest contributor to ill health in modern societies. The cost of stress in terms of absenteeism, lost productivity, and health care expense is rapidly increasing. As the problem continues to worsen, there will be an increasing need for interactive systems designed to help people cope with stress. Effective prevention of stress's adverse effects will require the widest possible deployment and implementation of stress reduction strategies. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

191,Employee use and perceived benefit of a complementary and alternative medicine wellness clinic at a major military hospital: Evaluation of a pilot program,"Objectives: The objectives of this study were to examine the feasibility of a weekly on-site complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) wellness clinic for staff at a military hospital, and to describe employees' perceptions of program effectiveness. Setting: The study setting was the Restore &amp; RenewÂ® Wellness Clinic at a United States Department of Defense hospital. Subjects: The subjects were hospital nurses, physicians, clinicians, support staff, and administrators. Interventions: The walk-in wellness clinic was open 8:00 am-2:00 pm 1 day a week. Participants selected one or more modalities each visit: ear acupuncture, clinical acupressure, and Zero Balancing.Â® Outcome measures: A self-report survey was done after each clinic visit to evaluate clinic features and perceived impact on stress-related symptoms, compassion for patients, sleep, and workplace or personal relationships. Results: Surveys completed after first-time and repeat visits (n=2,756 surveys) indicated that most participants agreed or strongly agreed they felt more relaxed after sessions (97.9%), less stress (94.5%), more energy (84.3%), and less pain (78.8%). Ninety-seven percent (97%) would recommend it to a co-worker. Among surveys completed after five or more visits, more than half (59%-85%) strongly agreed experiencing increased compassion with patients, better sleep, improved mood, and more ease in relations with co-workers. Perceived benefits were sustained and enhanced by number of visits. The most frequently reported health habit changes were related to exercise, stress reduction, diet/nutrition, and weight loss. Conclusions: This evaluation suggests that a hospital-based wellness clinic based on CAM principles and modalities is feasible, well-utilized, and perceived by most participants to have positive health benefits related to stress reduction at work, improved mood and sleep, and lifestyle.

192,The prevalence of burnout among oncology professionals: Oncologists are at risk of developing burnout,"Objective: International research shows that oncology staff suffers more from burnout than other healthcare professionals. Burnout is common among oncologists. The prevalence of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment appears to be signi ficantly higher among physicians. Detecting burnout is highly relevant, because it affects the personal well-being and quality of life of the healthcare professional. A national study on the prevalence of burnout in oncology was never conducted in Flanders (Dutch-speaking part of Belgium). Methods: The CÃ©dric HÃ¨le institute spread anonymous questionnaires among 923 healthcare workers in oncology (physicians, social workers, psychologists, nurses, and specialist-nurses) in Flanders. The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part contained questions concerning demographic and job features. The second part included the Dutch version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results: Five hundred and fifty subjects participated in the survey (response rate of 59.5%). Of themedical oncologists, 51.2%suffered fromemotional exhaustion, 31.8%fromdepersonalization, and 6.8% from a lack of personal accomplishment. Multivariate analysis of variance suggested a significantly elevated level of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization in oncologists compared with other professionals. Logistic regression indicated that the following variables have predictive value on risk of burnout: gender, profession, and combining work in a university hospital with work in a private hospital. Conclusion: The CHi research showed a significantly increased level of burnout-components in professionals working in oncology, especially inmedical oncologists. These results should have an impact on the daily clinic of oncology, and could be guidance for further research.

193,Counseling Psychology and Occupational Health Psychology,"Given its historical roots in vocational psychology and its current emphases on multiculturalism, positive psychology and social justice, counseling psychology is uniquely poised to contribute to the emerging, interdisciplinary field of occupational health psychology (OHP). Despite a halving of work-related injury rates in recent decades, work remains the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The goal of OHP is to protect and promote the health of workers and of their families, and to improve the quality of work life. Occupational health psychology has a threefold focus on the work environment, the individual worker, and the interface between work and family. Specific topics that OHP is attempting to address include work-related stress; occupational health disparities related to gender, age, ethnicity or race, work-family interface; increasing intervention effectiveness; improving safety climate; job design; and work organization.

194,Interaction effects of effort-reward imbalance and overcommitment on emotional exhaustion and job performance,"The model of effort-reward imbalance, with its 2 components effort-reward imbalance (ERI) and overcommitment (OC), has proven its significance in the area of work stress and occupational health. The 2 aims of the present study were to study the relationships of the 2 model components ERI (as a measure of chronic work stress) and OC (as a person variable) with self-rated emotional exhaustion (as a personal outcome) as well as supervisor-rated job performance (as an organizational outcome). Second, we tested the often neglected interaction hypothesis of the model, which proposes that OC potentiates the detrimental relationships between ERI and respective outcome variables. We applied multilevel modeling based on data from 152 employees nested in 20 teams from a German manufacturing company. Our results showed that ERI was positively related to emotional exhaustion and negatively related to supervisor-rated job performance, whereas OC was unrelated to emotional exhaustion and job performance. Testing the interaction hypothesis by taking OC into account as a moderator, our data showed that OC significantly aggravated the associations between ERI and emotional exhaustion, as well as ERI and job performance. We discuss limitations and implications for future research and practice. Â© 2012 American Psychological Association.","Feuerhahn N., KÃ¼hnel J., Kudielka B.M.",0,10.1037/a0028338,149
195,Healthy eating at different risk levels for job stress: Testing a moderated mediation,"Health behavior, like fruit and vegetable consumption (FVC), is affected by unfavorable job conditions. However, there is little research to date that combines job stress models and health-behavior change models. This longitudinal study examined the contribution of risk factors associated with job stress to the intention-planning-FVC relationship. In the context of the Health Action Process Approach, action planning (when-where-how plans) and coping planning (plans to overcome anticipated barriers) have been shown to be successful mediators in the translation of health-related intentions into action. Risk factors for job stress are operationalized as the interaction of job demands and job resources in line with the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model. Two hundred seventy-two employees (mean age 41.2 years, 73.9% female) from different jobs completed measures of intention at baseline (t1), action planning and coping planning 2 weeks later (t2), and FVC another 2 weeks later (t3). Job demands and job resources were assessed at t1 and t2. A moderated mediation analysis indicated that risk factors for job stress moderate the translation of intention into action planning (B = -0.23, p < .05) and coping planning (B = -0.14, p < .05). No moderation effect of the planning-FVC relationship by risk factors for job stress was found. However, coping planning directly predicted FVC (B = 0.36, p < .001). Findings suggest that employees intending to eat healthily use action planning and coping planning when job demands exceed job resources. For increasing FVC, coping planning appears most beneficial.

196,Cognitive therapy and behavioural coping in the management of work- related stress: An intervention study,Transactional models of stress emphasize the importance of cognitive appraisal of potential stressors in the determination of the stress response. This appraisal can be modified by the use of techniques normally associated with cognitive therapy. The contribution of a specifically cognitive component when intervening in work-related stress has not been well evaluated to date. This research seeks to determine the effectiveness of stress management training in the treatment of the work-related effects of stress by comparing the role of modifying dysfunctional cognitions with the teaching of appropriate behavioural coping strategies. Participants were allocated to one of two intervention conditions or to a waiting list control group. Those in the intervention conditions received group stress management either with the focus on delivering cognitive therapy techniques or with the focus on behavioural coping skills. Measures of general health were taken at the beginning and end of intervention and at 3-month follow-up. Participants in the cognitive therapy groups who were reporting symptoms of general ill-health at the start of the intervention showed a significant improvement at follow-up. Cognitive therapy appears to have been an effective intervention in work-related stress. Those in the behavioural group showed a smaller but still clinically effective improvement. Results are discussed in terms of methodological issues and implications for future research. It is suggested that changes in cognitive appraisal may need to be developed.,"Gardner, B; Rose, J; Mason, O; Tyler, P; Cushway, D",0,10.1080/02678370500157346,151
197,Risk of antenatal psychosocial distress in indigenous women and its management at primary health care centres in Australia,"Objective: This study explored the risk of antenatal psychosocial distress (APD) and associated potential factors and examined management aspects of risk of APD in women attending Aboriginal primary health care services in Australia.Method: Audits of medical records of 797 pregnant women from 36 primary health centres in five jurisdictions (NSW, QLD, SA, WA and NT) were undertaken as part of a quality improvement programme. Information collected included mental health assessed by a standard screening tools, enquiry regarding social and emotional well-being (SEWB), depression management (including antidepressant medications) and referral.Results: Around 18% (n=141) of women were at risk of APD based on assessment using a standard screening tool or by SEWB enquiry. There was a significant association between risk of distress and women's life style behaviours (e.g., alcohol, illicit drug use) and health centre characteristics. Of the 141 women, 16% (n=22) were prescribed antidepressant drugs during pregnancy. A range of nonpharmaceutical mental health interventions were also recorded, including brief intervention of 61% (n=86), counselling of 57% (n=80) and cognitive behaviour therapy of 5% (n=7). About 39% (n=55) of women with APD were referred to external services for consultations with a psychiatrist, psychologist or social worker or to a women's refuge centre.Conclusions: The higher risk of APD associated with women's life style behaviour indicates that the better understanding of mental health in its cultural context is essential.

198,Systemic Trauma,"Substantial theoretical, empirical, and clinical work examines trauma as it relates to individual victims and perpetrators. As trauma professionals, it is necessary to acknowledge facets of institutions, cultures, and communities that contribute to trauma and subsequent outcomes. Systemic trauma-contextual features of environments and institutions that give rise to trauma, maintain it, and impact posttraumatic responses-provides a framework for considering the full range of traumatic phenomena. The current issue of the Journal of Trauma & Dissociation is composed of articles that incorporate systemic approaches to trauma. This perspective extends conceptualizations of trauma to consider the influence of environments such as schools and universities, churches and other religious institutions, the military, workplace settings, hospitals, jails, and prisons; agencies and systems such as police, foster care, immigration, federal assistance, disaster management, and the media; conflicts involving war, torture, terrorism, and refugees; dynamics of racism, sexism, discrimination, bullying, and homophobia; and issues pertaining to conceptualizations, measurement, methodology, teaching, and intervention. Although it may be challenging to expand psychological and psychiatric paradigms of trauma, a systemic trauma perspective is necessary on both scientific and ethical grounds. Furthermore, a systemic trauma perspective reflects current approaches in the fields of global health, nursing, social work, and human rights. Empirical investigations and intervention science informed by this paradigm have the potential to advance scientific inquiry, lower the incidence of a broader range of traumatic experiences, and help to alleviate personal and societal suffering.

199,Behavioral interventions for recent trauma: Empirically informed practice guidelines,"Despite the successes in the treatment of chronic trauma-related distress, little attention has been devoted to developing behavioral interventions to be delivered soon after traumatic exposure in an effort to promote positive posttraumatic adjustment and to minimize the likelihood of enduring psychopathology. As a result, other forms of early intervention have filled this void and have been widely disseminated and applied, despite the lack of compelling evidence attesting to their efficacy. This article reviews the literature bearing on early interventions for trauma, including the encouraging outcomes of recently developed behavioral treatments. Empirically informed practice guidelines for intervening with recently traumatized individuals are presented. Future treatment development efforts will need to address an issue that has been largely neglected in traditional treatment models for traumatized populations - that of traumatic bereavement. Behavioral interventions may be particularly well-equipped to address this source of distress. Â© 2005 Sage Publications.","Gray M.J., Litz B.T.",0,10.1177/0145445504270884,154
200,The determinants of teachers' well-being: The mediating role of mental fatigue,"In recent years, many studies have focused on the determinants and consequences of teacher stress. One of the most recent theoretical models concerning stress is the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model. This study examines one process - namely the energetic process - which supposes that high job demands exhaust employees' mental and physical resources and therefore cause ill health. Particularly, this study examines the mediating role of mental fatigue between three job demands of teachers (workload, inequity and work/family confl ict) and three consequences of stress: psychological and physical symptoms and work satisfaction. An Italian version of the selfreport Questionnaire for Psychosocial Work Environment and Stress (PWSQ) was administered to 697 teachers belonging to a random sample of 17 school organizations. The results showed that mental fatigue has a mediating role in the relationship between work/family confl ict and the three outcomes considered, namely psychological and physical symptoms, and work satisfaction. This study has an important implication for intervention strategy because mental fatigue is a pre-strain condition which arises before more intense outcomes, such as stress-related diseases occur. Identifi cation of this condition allows prevention of the consequences of stress.

201,Talking about work stress: Discourse analysis and implications for stress interventions,"This study used discourse analysis to explore the way in which employees understand work stress. Twenty-two female clerical workers in a Canadian city participated in focus group meetings where they talked about and made sense of their experiences of work stress. The women's accounts were analysed using discourse analysis methods (i.e. an examination of how talk is constructed). The findings revealed that talking about being stressed provides a socially acceptable way of expressing discomfort and regaining a sense of importance that is lost through feeling under-valued and under-appreciated in the organization. In contrast, admitting to being unable to cope with stress was considered to be 'abnormal'. The stress discourse fosters a sense of helplessness and ambiguity by not acknowledging external influences on clerical workers' experiences, such as their place within the power structure of the organization, and by limiting their sense of agency and control over problems experienced at work. The implications of these findings for organizational culture and interventions are discussed. For example, employers are encouraged to be conscious of the messages being sent to employees about how negative emotions or distressing experiences at work are to be addressed (i.e. how 'stress' is to be managed). Recommendations are made for future research using discourse analysis, such as the examination of alternative discourses that aim to improve conditions at work.","Harkness, AMB; Long, BC; Bermbach, N; Patterson, K; Jordan, S; Kahn, H",0,10.1080/02678370500160068,156
202,"The relationships of character strengths with coping, work-related stress, and job satisfaction","Personality traits have often been highlighted to relate to how people cope with stressful events. The present paper focuses on character strengths as positive personality traits and examines two basic assumptions that were derived from a core characteristic of character strengths (i.e., to determine how individuals deal with adversities): (1) character strengths correlate with coping and (2) buffer the effects of work-related stress on job satisfaction. Two different samples (i.e., a mixed sample representing various occupations [N = 214] and a nurses sample [N = 175]) filled in measures for character strengths, coping, work-related stress, and job satisfaction. As expected, intellectual, emotional, and interpersonal strengths were related to coping. Interpersonal strengths played a greater role for coping among nurses, as interactions with others are an essential part of their workday. Furthermore, intellectual strengths partially mediated the negative effect of work-related stress on job satisfaction. These findings open a new field for research on the role of personality in coping with work-related stress. Character strengths are trainable personal characteristics, and therefore valuable resources to improve coping with work-related stress and to decrease the negative effects of stress. Further research is needed to investigate this assumed causality. Â© 2015 Harzer and Ruch.","Harzer C., Ruch W.",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00165,157
203,Treating posttraumatic stress disorder in first responders: A systematic review,"First responders are generally considered to be at greater risk for full or partial posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than most other occupations because their duties routinely entail confrontation with traumatic stressors. These critical incidents typically involve exposure to life threat, either directly or as a witness. There is a substantial literature that has examined the risk factors, symptom presentation, course, and comorbidities of PTSD in this population. However, to our knowledge, there are no systematic reviews of treatment studies for first responders. We conducted a systematic review of the PTSD treatment literature (English and non-English) in order to evaluate such treatment proposals based on what is known about treating PTSD in first responders. We especially sought to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) whose primary outcome was PTSD. Our search identified 845 peer-reviewed articles of which 0.002% (n. =. 2) were bona fide RCTs of PTSD treatment in first responders. Both studies tested a psychosocial treatment. We did not locate a single psychopharmacologic RCT for PTSD in first responders. An additional 2 psychosocial studies and 13 case or observational studies comprised the remaining extant literature. Though both RCTs showed significant large treatment effects (. d=. 1.37; h. =. 0.92), the literature is startlingly sparse and is not sufficient for evidence-based recommendations for first responders.

204,The impact of an incentive on the use of an online self-directed wellness and self-management program,"Background: Those who pay for health care are increasingly looking for strategies to influence individuals to take a more active role in managing their health. Incenting health plan members and/or employees to participate in wellness programs is a widely used approach. Objective: In this study, we examine financial incentives to health plan members to participate in an online self-management/wellness program-US $20 for completing the patient activation measure (PAM) and an additional US $40 for completing 8 learning modules. We examined whether the characteristics of plan members differed by the degree to which they responded to the incentives. Further, we examined whether participation in the wellness program was associated with improvements in PAM scores and changes in health care utilization. Methods: This retrospective study compared demographic characteristics and change in PAM scores and health utilization for 144,625 health plan members in 2011. Four groups were compared: (1) those who were offered the incentives but chose not to participate (n=128,634), (2) those who received the initial incentive (PAM only) but did not complete 8 topics (n=7099), (3) those who received both incentives (completing 8 topics but no more) (n=2693), and (4) those who received both incentives and continued using the online program beyond what was required by the incentives (n=6249). Results: The vast majority of health plan members did not participate in the program (88.91%, 128,634/144,675). Of those who participated, only 7099 of 16,041 (44.25%) completed the PAM for the first incentive, 2693 (16.79%) completed 8 topics for the second incentive, and 6249 (38.96%) received both incentives and continued using the program beyond the incentive requirements. Nonparticipants were more likely to be men and to have lower health risk scores on average than the other three groups of participants (P<.001). In multivariate regression models, those who used the online program (8 topics or beyond) increased their PAM score by approximately 1 point more than those who only took the PAM and did not use the wellness program (P<.03). In addition, emergency department visits were lower for all groups who responded to any level of the incentive as compared to those who did not (P<.01). No differences were found in other types of utilization. Conclusions: The incentive was not sufficient to spark most health plan members to use the wellness program. However, the fact that many program participants went beyond the incentive in their use of the online wellness program suggests that the users of the online program found value in using it, and it was their own internal motivation that stimulated this additional use. Providing an incentive for program participation may be an effective pathway for working with less activated patients, particularly if the program is tailored to the needs of the less activated.

205,Findings for a CBT Support Group for Latina Migrant Farmworkers in Western Colorado,"Despite previous research findings that suggested that migrant farmworkers are at great risk for mental health problems, no published research has evaluated mental health interventions in migrant farmworkers. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate a culturally-responsive cognitive-behavioral support group for migrant farmworker women of Mexican descent. Six participants with elevated depression and migrant farmworker stress underwent a 6-session intervention conducted in Spanish by a licensed clinical psychologist and a lay health worker (promotora). Participants completed baseline, posttreatment and 6-month followup assessments. Baseline and outcome measures included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Migrant Farmworker Stress Inventory, Personality Assessment Inventory Anxiety Scale, Beck Hopelessness Scale, and Rosenburg Self-Esteem Inventory. Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Tests indicated significant reductions in depression, anxiety, migrant farmworker stress, and hopelessness and increased self-esteem scores at posttreatment and followup. Eighty-three percent of participants achieved clinically significant pretreatment-posttreatment change and 100Â % achieved clinically significant pretreatment-followup change. Our overall findings provide support for the usage of culturally-responsive support groups as an effective short-term intervention for migrant farmworkers. Our use of a promotora appeared especially helpful in decreasing stigma and promoting trust. Although our intervention shows promise, future research should evaluate the intervention in a more controlled manner.

206,Mediating effects of emotional exhaustion on the relationship between job demand-control model and mental health,"This study attempted to investigate the role of emotional exhaustion as a mediator on the relationship between job demands-control (JDC) model and mental health. Three-wave data from 297 employees were collected. The results showed that job demands were positively related to emotional exhaustion, and increasing job demands will increase the level of emotional exhaustion. Job control was negatively associated with emotional exhaustion; therefore, increasing job control will decrease the level of emotional exhaustion. Emotional exhaustion was negatively related to mental health. Emotional exhaustion fully mediated the relationship between job demands and mental health, and partially mediated the positive relationship between job control and mental health. In addition, job control was positively associated with mental health directly. The remarkable finding of the present study was that emotional exhaustion served as the key mediator between the JDC model and mental health. Theoretical and managerial implications and limitations were discussed. Copyright Â© 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Huang Y.-H., Du P.-L., Chen C.-H., Yang C.-A., Huang I.-C.",0,10.1002/smi.1340,161

209,"Exploring the Michigan model: The relationship of personality, managerial support and organizational structure with health outcomes in entrants to the healthcare environment","Few studies have examined the role of managerial support in the adaptation of entrants to healthcare. The purpose of this study was to identify the job characteristic and role-related variables that mediate the effects of managerial support and personality on the mental and physical health and sickness absence in two independent groups of new recruits to a healthcare organization. Entrants to a healthcare environment (student nurses) were surveyed 25 weeks after entry. Latent variables represented neuroticism, demand, control, role clarity and affective outcome variables in a simplified version of the Michigan model of work stress (House, 1981). This study used a two-stage approach to structural equation modelling, exploring hypothesized structural models on an initial data set (N = 195) prior to confirmation on an independent replication data set (N = 239) using multi-sample methods. Finally the confirmed model of choice was evaluated using the combined data (N = 434). Emotional distress reported at 6 months was found to be associated with dispositional characteristics of the entrant and indirectly, via job satisfaction, with managerial support from academic and clinical sources. Managerial support from academic and clinical sources had an indirect influence on job satisfaction, but by differing mechanisms involving role clarity and control. The demands perceived by the entrants arose from neuroticism and were independent of any other variable. Emotional distress had its deleterious association with sickness absence via somatic health. This study details a series of mechanisms that will subsequently be tested longitudinally. Â© 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.","Jones M.C., Smith K., Johnston D.W.",0,10.1080/02678370500065325,163

211,Occupational stress management: An inpatient group therapy program [StressbewÃ¤ltigung am arbeitsplatz: Ein stationÃ¤res gruppentherapieprogramm],"Background: Despite increasing occupational stress and its importance for the development and maintenance of psychosomatic disorders, there is a lack of specific approaches to treat occupational stress. This article presents the evaluation of a 16-hour job-focused group therapy concept called 'occupational stress management' for cognitive-behavioral inpatient treatment. Patients and Methods: In a controlled longitudinal design, 133 patients that participated in the occupational stress management group were compared to 156 patients that received standard symptomatic therapy only. Questionnaire data from admission, discharge and 3 months post-treatment addressed the objective work situation (work status, sick days, applications for early retirement), subjective estimates of intensity of work stressors and of individual coping skills as well as how satisfied participants were with work-related treatment contents. We expected improvements in the rates of return to work and in coping with work-related problems for the intervention group. Results: Already 3 months post-treatment, the intervention group showed a lower rate of job losses (-2.05%, controls: -8.67%) and a reduction in their intention of applying for early retirement (-3.8%, controls: +11.7). Moreover, they exhibited a reduction in a type of inadequate coping related to 'burn-out' and a higher degree of satisfaction with work-related aspects of their inpatient treatment. The work-related intervention turned out to be superior in the promotion of experienced control at work. Conclusions: These early results support the feasibility of a work-related inpatient intervention group and emphasize its specific positive work-related effects for individuals with elevated levels of occupational stress. The inclusion of a job-related therapy group into standard inpatient treatment on units for behavioral medicine could improve health-related coping with job-stress.

212,Improvement of balance between work stress and recovery after a body awareness program for chronic aspecific psychosomatic symptoms,"Objective: A 3-day residential body awareness program (BAP) was developed to teach people with chronic aspecific psychosomatic symptoms (CAPS) to react adequately to disturbances of the balance between a daily workload and the capacity to deal with it. The long-term effects of the program in improving the balance between work stress and recovery are presented in this study. The intervening effect of 'improved balance' on quality of life is also analysed. Methods: A pre-post design is used with post-measures at 2 and 12 months after the program, without controls (n = 122). Mean age is 42.5 years (S.D. = 9.0) and 60% of participants are female. Results: The results show participants become more active physically and socially, and at the same time take the opportunity to recover. There was a difference measured in changing balance for participants who are fully employed and participants who are not working or are working part-time due to health problems: the second group reintegrated into work, the first group spent more time socialising inside the family. Personal goals are realised by 85% of the participants. Realising personal goals and becoming more active is a mediating factor for increasing quality of life. The majority of the measured changes can be interpreted as clinically relevant outcomes with medium-to-large effect sizes. Spouses of the participants also confirm these effects. Discussion and conclusion: Evaluation of the BAP gives evidence to conclude that this program leads to long-term effects in CAPS. Participants react more adequately to disturbances between daily workload and the capacity to deal with this load. Two and 12 months after the 3-day program, they changed their behaviour to a more active lifestyle and increased self-management in coping with stress and psychosomatic symptoms. Practice implications: By paying more attention to the balance between work stress and recovery, patient educators may be able to increase their effectiveness. Personal goal realization can be effective in guiding people by getting them out of the negative spiral. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

213,A brief cognitive-behavioral stress management program for secondary school teachers,"Objective: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a brief cognitivebehavioral program that was designed to reduce the work-related stress levels of secondary school teachers. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was used to compare the intervention groups with the wait-list control groups. Seventy teachers from the intervention groups and 54 from the control groups completed a set of validated scales at the baseline and 3-4 wk later. The scales included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale-Form A, the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, and the Occupational Stress Inventory Revised Edition. Results: After controlling for the baseline measures, the intervention groups had significantly lower role stress, personal strain and overall work-related stress 3-4 wk after the baseline measurements. The intervention groups also had significantly higher stress management behaviors, and less general stress and dysfunctional thoughts than the control groups (all pâ‰¤0.05). The levels of dysfunctional thoughts and stress management behaviors significantly predicted general stress after intervention and personal resource deficits. The level of dysfunctional thoughts also predicted the personal strain of work-related stresses (all p<0.05). Conclusions: The brief program reported in this study was efficacious in reducing the work-related stress of secondary teachers. Teachers experienced less work-related stress after the program, and they reported reduced dysfunctional thoughts and enhanced stress management behaviors. This program may be considered as an initial strategy for teachers to develop skills to cope with their work-related stress in the short term and could be incorporated with other strategies to achieve longer-term effects.","Leung S.S.K., Chiang V.C.L., Chui Y.Y., Mak Y.W., Wong D.F.K.",0,10.1539/joh.L10037,167
214,"Putting Brain Training to the Test in the Workplace: A Randomized, Blinded, Multisite, Active-Controlled Trial.","BackgroundCognitive training (CT) is effective at improving cognitive outcomes in children with and without clinical impairment as well as older individuals. Yet whether CT is of any preventative health benefit to working age adults is controversial. Our objective was therefore to investigate the real-world efficacy of CT in the workplace, involving employees from across the working-age spectrum and addressing many of the design issues that have limited trials to date. Methods and Findings135 white collar employees of a large Australian public sector organization were randomised to either 16 weeks (20 minutes three times per week) of online CT or an active control (AC) program of equal length and structure. Cognitive, wellbeing and productivity outcome measures were analysed across three timepoints: baseline, immediately after training and 6 months post-training. CT effects on cognitive outcomes were limited, even after planned subgroup analyses of cognitive capacity and age. Unexpectedly, we found that our AC condition, which comprised viewing short documentaries about the natural world, had more impact. Compared to the CT group, 6 months after the end of training, those in the AC group experienced a significant increase in their self-reported Quality of Life (Effect Size g?=?.34 vs -.15; TIME*GROUP p?=?.003), decrease in stress levels (g?=?.22 vs -.19; TIME x GROUP p?=?.03), and overall improvement in Psychological Wellbeing (g?=?.32 vs -.06; TIME*GROUP p?=?.02).ConclusionsCT does not appear to positively impact cognition or wellbeing amongst white collar office workers; however, short time-out respite activities may have value in the promotion of psychological wellbeing. Given looming challenges to workplace productivity, further work-based interventional research targeting employee mental health is recommended.

215,Work stress is associated with diabetes and prediabetes: Cross-sectional results from the MIPH industrial cohort studies,"Background: Diabetes is rapidly rising globally, and the relation of psychosocial stress in workplace to diabetes and prediabetes is not well investigated. Purpose: The aim of the study was to examine the association of work stress with diabetes and prediabetes in a sample of German industrial workers. Method: In this cross-sectional survey of an occupational cohort (n = 2,674, 77 % male), work stress was measured by the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) Questionnaire. Diabetic status, i.e., diabetes and prediabetes, were diagnosed by glycated hemoglobin A1c criterion or fasting plasma glucose criterion supplemented by self-reports. Results: The overall prevalence rates of diabetes and prediabetes were 3.5 and 42.2 %, respectively. Using ordinal logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounding factors, high ERI at work was associated with diabetes-related ordinal variable (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 1.02-1.58) and prediabetes-related ordinal variable (OR, 1.26; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.58) in men, whereas the associations in women were somewhat less pronounced and did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: The findings indicate that work stress in terms of ERI is associated with diabetes and prediabetes in German industrial male workers. If supported by prospective evidence, results point to a new approach towards primary prevention of diabetes.

This study examined a project designed to improve the health and wellness of employees of Brabantia, a Dutch manufacturer of household goods, by means of lifestyle changes and changes in working conditions. Methods. The workers at one Brabantia site constituted the experimental group, and the workers from two other sites formed the control group. Biomedical variables, lifestyles, general stress reactions, and quality of work were measured identically in both groups at baseline and 1, 2, and 3 years later. During this period, there was continuous registration of absenteeism Results. The interventions brought about favorable short-term changes in terms of health risks, and there were stable effects on working conditions (especially decision latitude) and absenteeism. Conclusions. A combination of interventions directed at both lifestyles and the work environment can produce extensive and stable effects on health-related variables, wellness, and absenteeism.","Maes, S; Verhoeven, C; Kittel, F; Scholten, H",0,10.2105/AJPH.88.7.1037,170
217,Decreased rate of back injuries through a wellness program for offshore petroleum employees,"High rates of injury, particularly those for back injuries, at an offshore petroleum unit were addressed through an intensive wellness program initiated in 1991. The number of all types of injuries, including back injuries, decreased between 1991 and 1995. The number of back injuries decreased from nine in 1987 to four in 1992 and was zero in 1993. Although there are inadequate data to provide power for a significant result, other criteria suggest a causal relationship. The results are consistent with the few published studies that suggest a decrease in the number of injuries in association with exercise and perhaps with modification of psychosocial risk factors. Calculations suggest a cost savings of over $800,000 and a return on investment of $2.51, as well as avoidance of pain and injury.","Maniscalco P., Lane R., Welke M., Mitchell J.H., Husting L.",0,10.1097/00043764-199909000-00014,171
218,The effectiveness of a 15 minute weekly massage in reducing physical and psychological stress in nurses,"Objective: To investigate the effectiveness of massage therapy in reducing physiological and psychological indicators of stress in nurses employed in an acute care hospital.Design: Randomised controlled trial.Setting: Acute care hospital in Queensland.Subjects: Sixty nurses were recruited to the five week study and randomly assigned to two groups. Intervention: A 15 minute back massage once a week. The control group did not receive any therapy.Main outcome measures: Demographic information, a life events questionnaire and a brief medical history of all participants was completed at enrolment. Physiological stress was measured at weeks one, three and five by urinary cortisol and blood pressure readings. Psychological stress levels were measured at weeks one and five with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).Results: Differences in the change in urinary cortisol and blood pressure between the two groups did not reach statistical significance. However, STAI scores decreased over the five weeks for those participants who received a weekly massage. The STAI scores of the control group increased over the five week period. These differences between the groups were statistically significant.Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that massage therapy is a beneficial tool for the health of nurses as it may reduce psychological stress levels. It is recommended that further large studies be conducted to measure the symptoms of stress rather than the physiological signs of stress in nurses.","Bost, Nerolie; Wallis, Marianne",1,,172

221,Depression in the workforce: The intermediary effect of medical comorbidity,"It is amply documented that mood disorders adversely affect job satisfaction, workforce productivity, and absenteeism/presenteeism. It is also well documented that mood disorders are an independent risk factor for several chronic medical disorders (e.g., obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease). Emerging evidence indicates that the workforce dysfunction associated with depression is partially mediated by medical comorbidity. We conducted a PubMed search of all English-language articles published between 2005 and July 2009 with the following search terms: major depressive disorder and depression, cross-referenced with work productivity, disability, economic cost, absenteeism, presenteeism, and medical comorbidity. Articles selected for review were based on adequacy of sample size, the use of standardized experimental procedures, validated assessment measures, and overall manuscript quality. Mood disorders are the most impairing condition amongst working adults. It is estimated that approximately 35-50 of employees with depression will take short-term disability leave at some point during their job tenure. Moreover, 15-20 of the workforce will receive short-term disability benefits during any given year; the annual income of individuals affected by depression is reduced by approximately 10 when compared to unaffected employees. Chronic stress-sensitive conditions independently contribute to workforce maladjustment and associated disability. The mood disorder population is differentially affected by several stress-related medical conditions resulting in greater impairment in the workforce. Disability modelling in the depressed employee has emphasized the complex interrelationship between depressive symptoms, workforce stress, and consequent disability. A more refined model must include the effects of chronic medical conditions as a powerful mediator and/or moderator of workforce impairment. Multidisciplinary interventions have been demonstrated to reduce, but not eliminate workforce disability related to depression, underscoring the need for elucidating other modifiable factors. Screening, treatment, and prevention initiatives need to target chronic medical conditions in depressed employees in order to reduce overall workforce disability. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this chapter is to introduce the concept of reactivity to occupational health psychology (OHP). Specifically, it aims to (i) define the construct of reactivity; (ii) discuss how it is measured; and (iii) describe the implications of reactivity to OHP. Daily process assessments provide some unique advantages over other methods and contribute significantly to our understanding of behavioral processes. In particular, they afford a naturalistic assessment of people's responses to stressors occurring in everyday life. The experience of stress and related consequences is not just restricted to the workplace.

228,The Role of Managers in Critical Incident Stress Management Programmes: A Qualitative Study of New Zealand Social Workers,"This paper reports part of a larger exploratory research study of social workers' preferred models of critical incident stress management and experiences of critical incident stress debriefing. Social workers were invited to contribute to the research through an advertisement in the national association's newsletter for Aotearoa New Zealand Association of Social Workers. Using a qualitative methodology involving in-depth interviews with 13 social workers, participants were asked about their experiences of critical events encountered within their workplaces over the last five years. Interviews were recorded by audiotape with consent and analysed using thematic analysis. Four main themes emerged: the importance of preparation for critical incidents, the role of relationship between line managers and social workers, specifically the line manager's support immediately after the critical incident, and the availability of peer/colleague networks. An unexpected finding was that social workers interviewed noted that the pre-existing relationship with the line manager influenced their experience of the debriefing process itself. The more engaged and emotionally aware the manager was seen, the more the social worker claimed the debriefing process had been successful from their perspectives. The implications for social workers and their employing agencies are discussed. Â© 2014 Â© 2013 GAPS.",Pack M.J.,0,10.1080/02650533.2013.828279,182

The following conclusions emerge from the review: (1) CPTs are vulnerable to elevated stress; (2) undue stress can negatively impact CPTs' personal and professional functioning and, in turn, result in less than optimal standards of care for clients; (3) there is a dearth of studies on stress in this population and no published intervention studies; (4) incorporating self-care strategies into clinical psychology training is recommended; and (5) ""third-wave"" cognitive behaviour therapy stress management interventions have been efficacious in comparable populations. In view of the potential costs of elevated stress to trainees themselves and their clients, research on stress and stress management in this population is of a high priority. Broad research agendas are proposed for these two domains. Modifications to clinical training programmes to reduce trainee stress are required and should be evidence-based and systematically revaluated.

231,The Development of a Patient-Centered Program Based on the Relaxation Response: The Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP),"Background: Chronic daily stress has significant physical, emotional, and financial implications; levels of stress are increasing in the US. Dr. Benson highlighted how the mind and body function together in one's experience of the stress response and proposed the existence of the relaxation response (RR). Objective: The current paper describes the foundation and development of an 8-session multimodal treatment program for coping with chronic stress: the Relaxation Response Resiliency Program (3RP). Methods: We review the past decades of RR research, outline the development of the 3RP treatment, and provide an overview of the program's theory and content. Results: Extensive research and clinical work have examined how eliciting the RR may combat stress through down-regulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Related to this work are the multidimensional constructs of resiliency and allostatic load. The 3RP is based on principles from the fields of stress management, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and positive psychology, and has three core target areas: (1) elicitation of the RR; (2) stress appraisal and coping; and (3) growth enhancement. An 8-week patient-centered treatment program has been developed, with the purpose of assisting patients with a variety of psychological and medical issues to better cope with chronic stress. Conclusions: Mastery of the RR is theorized to maximize one's ability to benefit from multimodal mind body strategies. The goal of the 3RP is to enhance individuals' adaptive responses to chronic stress through increasing awareness and decreasing the physiological, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral effects of the stress response, while simultaneously promoting the effects of being in the RR.

233,"Exploring the relationship between work-related rumination, sleep quality, and work-related fatigue","This study examined the association among three conceptualizations of work-related rumination (affective rumination, problem-solving pondering, and detachment) with sleep quality and work-related fatigue. It was hypothesized that affective rumination and poor sleep quality would be associated with increased fatigue and that problem-solving pondering and detachment would be associated with decreased fatigue. The mediating effect of sleep quality on the relationship between work-related rumination and fatigue was also tested. An online questionnaire was completed by a heterogeneous sample of 719 adult workers in diverse occupations. The following variables were entered as predictors in a regression model: affective rumination, problem-solving pondering, detachment, and sleep quality. The dependent variables were chronic work-related fatigue (CF) and acute work-related fatigue (AF). Affective rumination was the strongest predictor of increased CF and AF. Problem-solving pondering was a significant predictor of decreased CF and AF. Poor sleep quality was predictive of increased CF and AF. Detachment was significantly negatively predictive for AF. Sleep quality partially mediated the relationship between affective rumination and fatigue and between problem-solving pondering and fatigue. Work-related affective rumination appears more detrimental to an individual's ability to recover from work than problem-solving pondering. In the context of identifying mechanisms by which demands at work are translated into ill-health, this appears to be a key finding and suggests that it is the type of work-related rumination, not rumination per se, that is important.

234,Participants' accounts of a stress management intervention,"Organizational-level stress management interventions are usually evaluated using quasi-experimental methods. In order to test intervention effectiveness, such methods examine the outcomes of between-group differences in intervention exposure: participants are rarely asked about their experiences of the intervention. However, this approach has been criticized because it provides little or no information about why interventions succeed or fail. The aim of this study was to examine whether an analysis of participants' narratives of what had happened during an organizational-level intervention might prove useful during evaluation. Nurses working in a UK hospital (n = 26) who had received an intervention to help them balance their administrative and clinical workloads, provided information about their experiences of it, and how these experiences were related to the effectiveness of the intervention. Template analysis of the data in their narratives identified codes relating to: i) intervention contexts (both pre-intervention and during the intervention); ii) implementation processes (including how participants made use of the intervention); and iii) participants' perceptions of the intervention's impact. The results indicated that participants' accounts provided information that is not captured by the dominant evaluation paradigm. Specifically, these data can i) help organizations to make better use of interventions, and ii) enhance research into the links between intervention processes, contexts and outcomes.","Randall, R; Cox, T; Gtiffiths, A",0,10.1177/0018726707081660,188
235,Evaluating organizational stress-management interventions using adapted study designs,"The evaluation of organizational stress management interventions has proved challenging for researchers and practitioners alike. Traditionally, researcher designed quasi-experiments have been regarded as the method for evaluating such interventions. However, relatively few such studies have been satisfactorily completed in organizations, and many of those that have did not adequately take account of intervention processes. This article presents an approach to evaluation that can help to overcome these problems. Two empirical studies are presented that demonstrate that measurement of the intervention process can be used to adapt and shape the design of the evaluation. In both studies, process evaluation incorporating the measurement of intervention exposure was used to partition participant samples ( into intervention and control groups). This approach has the potential to enable and strengthen quantitative outcome evaluation in situations where controlled quasi-experimentation is not possible.","Randall, R; Griffiths, A; Cox, T",0,10.1080/13594320444000209,189
236,The development of five scales to measure employees' appraisals of organizational-level stress management interventions,"Organizations and researchers often encounter difficulties when evaluating organizational-level stress management interventions. When interventions fail, often it is unclear whether the intervention itself was ineffective, or whether problems with implementation processes were to blame. In this paper we describe the development of questionnaire items that allow employees to report on their appraisals of aspects of intervention process issues that are frequently thought to be related to intervention outcomes. The study was carried out as part of the evaluation of a teamworking intervention implemented in the elderly care sector in Denmark. Using a combination of information gathered from published intervention research and qualitative data collected from participants involved in an intervention, questionnaire items were developed and their sensitivity, reliability, and validity were tested. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed five independent factors: line manager attitudes and actions, exposure to components of the intended intervention, employee involvement, employee readiness, and intervention history. They all showed significant correlations with post-intervention outcomes (job satisfaction, well-being, and self-efficacy). Line manager attitudes and actions showed particularly strong and unique relationships with outcome measures. We refer to this new group of scales for evaluating employees' appraisals of an intervention as the Intervention Process Measure (IPM).

With this in mind, the current study analyzed the relationship between outcomes of teacher well-being, including burnout and efficacy, and the implementation of School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS). Using a multilevel regression approach, the surveys of 184 teachers across 40 elementary schools were analyzed at individual and school levels. Results indicated that teachers in schools implementing SWPBIS with fidelity had significantly lower levels of burnout and significantly higher levels of efficacy. In addition, an interaction effect implied that teachers benefited most from SWPBIS implementation in schools of low socioeconomic status. Limitations of the study are discussed and directions for future interventions and research are recommended.

238,Pre-deployment stress briefing: does it have an effect?,"Background The role of giving information about stress and stress reactions to people about to be exposed to hazardous situations remains unclear. Such information might improve coping and hence resilience. Alternatively, it might increase the expectancy of experiencing adverse psychological consequences following exposure to a hazard.Aim To determine the effect of a pre-operational stress briefing on health and occupational indices among Naval and Marine personnel who were subsequently deployed to the 2003 Iraq War.Method Controlled, non-randomized, parallel group study. Mental health outcomes post-deployment were compared between those who received a pre-operational stress briefing and those who did not receive such a briefing.Results Stress briefing attendees were slightly younger, more likely to be marines and to have been exposed to traumatic events than non-attendees. There were no significant differences between the two groups for the health outcomes of common mental health disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder or alcohol misuse. Attendees reported higher morale/cohesion but these differences disappeared following adjustment for demographic and military factors. No differences between the two groups were apparent for experiencing problems during or post-deployment or for marital satisfaction.Conclusions We found no evidence that a pre-deployment stress briefing reduced subsequent medium-term psychological distress. On the other hand, we found no evidence of harm either. While only a randomized trial can give genuinely unbiased results, at present stress debriefing must be regarded as an unproven intervention, and it remains a matter of judgement as to whether or not it is indicated.","Sharpley, J.

240,Reducing workplace burnout: the relative benefits of cardiovascular and resistance exercise,"Objectives. The global burden of burnout cost is in excess of $300 billion annually. Locally, just under half of working Australians experience high levels of occupational burnout. Consequently, burnout interventions are paramount to organisational productivity. Exercise has the potential to provide a multilevel and cost effective burnout intervention. The current study aims to extend the literature by comparing cardiovascular with resistance exercise to assess their relative effectiveness against well-being, perceived stress, and burnout.Design. Participants were 49 (36 females and 13 males) previously inactive volunteers ranging in age from 19 to 68 that completed a four week exercise program of either cardiovascular, resistance, or no exercise (control). Randomised control trial design was employed.Method. Participants were measured against the Subjective Exercise Experience Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory.Results. After four weeks of exercise participants had greater positive well-being and personal accomplishment, and concomitantly less psychological distress, perceived stress, and emotional exhaustion. Cardiovascular exercise was found to increase well-being and decrease psychological distress, perceived stress, and emotional exhaustion. Resistance training was noticeably effective in increasing well-being and personal accomplishment and to reduce perceived stress. The present findings revealed large effect sizes suggesting that exercise may be an effective treatment for burnout. However, given a small sample size further research needs to be conducted.Conclusion. Exercise has potential to be an effective burnout intervention. Different types of exercise may assist employees in different ways. Organisations wishing to proactively reduce burnout can do so by encouraging their employees to access regular exercise programs.","Bretland, Rachel Judith; Thorsteinsson, Einar Baldvin",1,10.7717/peerj.891,194
241,Do managers experience more stress than employees? Results from the Intervention Project on Absence and Well-being (IPAW) study among Danish managers and their employees,"Objective: To examine whether managers' perceived stress and work strain is higher than perceived stress and work strain among employees. Methods and Participants: The study is based on questionnaire responses from 2052 respondents (128 managers and 1924 employees) at 48 worksites. Bi-variate and multivariate analyses were used to explain possible differences in stress levels and related mediators. Results: Managers experienced higher demands, higher level of conflicts, and lower degree of social support from peers. They tended to experience significantly lower emotional stress, whereas this trend was insignificant with regards to behavioural, somatic and cognitive stress. The difference was partly explained by higher scores in the psychosocial work environment factors; job satisfaction, perceived management quality from their managers, influence, degrees of freedom at work, possibilities for development and meaning of work. For behavioural stress, 41% of the difference was explained by the preventive factors, 20% for somatic stress, 39% for emotional stress and 56% for cognitive stress. Conclusions: This study indicates that the preventive psychosocial factors explain parts of the managers' lower stress level. These results contradict the lay perception of managers being under higher pressure and experiencing more stress than employees. Interventions aiming at reducing employee stress levels, especially regarding behavioural and cognitive stress, could benefit from focussing on psychosocial work environment exposures such as skill discretion, meaning of work, psychological demands, information flow and management quality.","Skakon, J; Kristensen, TS; Christensen, KB; Lund, T; Labriola, M",0,10.3233/WOR-2011-1112,195
242,The Effectiveness of an ACT Informed Intervention for Managing Stress and Improving Therapist Qualities in Clinical Psychology Trainees,"Objectives: Clinical psychology trainees (CPTs) are vulnerable to high stress, which can adversely affect their personal and professional functioning. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a group acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) informed stress management intervention for CPTs. Design: Outcome measures were work-related stress, distress, life satisfaction, counseling self-efficacy, self-compassion, and therapeutic alliance. A cohort-controlled design, where an experimental group (n = 28) was compared with a waitlist control group (n = 28), was utilized, with a 10-week follow-up. Results: Group comparisons showed statistically significant intervention effects for the main outcome measures, which were maintained at follow-up. Mediational analyses showed that changes on most outcomes were mediated by ACT mindfulness and acceptance processes. Conclusions: Findings support the effectiveness of a group ACT program for CPTs regarding stress reduction and improving therapist qualities.

243,"Investigating the associations among overtime work, health behaviors, and health: A longitudinal study among full-time employees","Background: It has often been suggested that high levels of overtime lead to adverse health outcomes. One mechanism that may account for this association is that working overtime leads to elevated levels of stress, which could affect worker's behavioral decisions or habits (such as smoking and lack of physical activity). In turn, this could lead to adverse health. Purpose: The present study examined this reasoning in a prospective longitudinal design. Data from the prospective 2-year Study on Health at Work (N=649) were used to test our hypotheses. Methods: Structural equation analysis was used to examine the relationships among overtime, beneficial (exercising, intake of fruit and vegetables) and risky (smoking and drinking) health behaviors, and health indicators (BMI and subjective health). Results: Working overtime was longitudinally related with adverse subjective health, but not with body mass. Moreover, working overtime was associated with lower levels of physical activity and intake of fruit and vegetables, but not with smoking and drinking. Finally, higher levels of risky and lower levels of beneficial health behaviors were longitudinally associated with ill health. Conclusions: The relation between overtime and ill health is partly accounted for by the unhealthy lifestyle in which overworkers tend to engage. However, a direct longitudinal effect of overtime on health suggested that the effects of overtime on health may also partly be due to the sustained physiological activation that results from working overtime. Whereas working a moderate amount of overtime does not usually entail major health risks, these will increase with increasing overtime.

244,Acceptance and commitment therapy for the treatment of stress among social workers: A randomized controlled trial,"Chronic stress increases the risk of health problems and absenteeism, with negative consequences for individuals, organizations and society. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a brief stress management intervention based on the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on stress and general mental health for Swedish social workers (n = 106) in a randomized, controlled trial. Participants were stratified according to stress level at baseline in order to examine whether initial stress level moderated the effect of the intervention. Two thirds of the participants had high stress levels at baseline (Perceived Stress Scale; score of â‰¥25). The results showed that the intervention significantly decreased levels of stress and burnout, and increased general mental health compared to a waiting list control. No statistically significant effects were, however, found for those with low levels of stress at baseline. Among participants with high stress, a substantial proportion (42%) reached criteria for clinically significant change. We concluded that the intervention successfully decreased stress and symptoms of burnout, and increased general mental health. Evidence is, thus, provided supporting ACT as brief, stress management intervention for social workers.

245,A pilot evaluation on a stress management programme using a combined approach of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for elementary school teachers,"The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy of implementing a stress management programme based on a combined approach using cognitive behavioural therapy and complementary and alternative medicine for elementary school teachers who experienced mild level of stress, anxiety and/or depressive symptoms in Hong Kong. A 12-h programme involving cognitive behavioural therapy, self-management, relaxation techniques (diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation), mindful exercises (qigong and yoga), aromatherapy and acupressure was conducted. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare the intervention groups (n = 47) with the wait-list control groups (n = 46). The primary outcome measures were depression, anxiety and stress. Results indicated that the intervention group had significant reduction in depression [(F = 3.93; degrees of freedom (df) = 2.90; p = 0.023)], anxiety (F = 3.37; df = 2.90; p = 0.039) and stress (F = 3.63; df = 2.89; p = 0.031) when compared with the control group. Participants in both groups demonstrated lowered level of salivary cortisol at the post-assessment. The pilot results provided preliminary support to the multi-component stress management programme in relieving affective symptoms of teachers. The programme may be considered as an initial strategy to empower teachers with the abilities to cope with their affective symptoms. Further evaluation using a better designed randomized study with a larger sample size is warranted. (word: 198; max.: 200).

246,Effects of a worksite stress management training program with six short-hour sessions: A controlled trial among Japanese employees,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component worksite stress management training (SMT) program among employees belong to Japanese steel company. Methods: Five workplaces were assigned to an intervention group and two workplaces to a control group. SMT with monthly 30-min sessions were provided to the intervention group for 6 mo. Intention- to-treat analyses were conducted among respondents of the intervention (n=96) and control groups (n=53). Results: Significant favorable intervention effects were found on knowledge (p<0.001) and marginally significant ones on professional efficacy (p=0.074) at one-month after completing the program. No significant intervention effects were observed on psychological distress, physical complaints, or job performance (p>0.05). However, in per-protocol analyses of those who attended all sessions, significant favorable effects were observed on psychological distress and job performance, as well as knowledge and professional efficacy (p<0.05). In addition, subgroup analyses revealed that those with initial low job control showed a favorable intervention effect only on knowledge (p<0.001), whereas those with initial high job control showed favorable intervention effects on knowledge (p<0.001), professional efficacy (p=0.023) and anxiety (p=0.033). Conclusions: The results suggest that the multi-component SMT program is effective at improving knowledge and professional efficacy, although job control appeared to moderate the effect of the program on professional efficacy. The program may also be effective at reducing psychological distress and increasing job performance, if participants complete all sessions.","Umanodan R., Kobayashi Y., Nakamura M., Kitaoka-Higashiguchi K., Kawakami N., Shimazu A.",0,10.1539/joh.L8055,200
247,"Examining occupational stress, sources of stress and stress management strategies through the eyes of management consultants: A multiple correspondence analysis for latent constructs","To date, little research has yet focused in broad assessment for management consultancy professionals. This investigation aims to analyse management consultants' self-perceptions of occupational stress (SPoOS), sources of stress (SoS) and stress management strategies (SMS) and to find latent constructs that can work as major determinants in consultants' conceptualization of SPoOS, SoS and SMS. Measures were completed, including demographics and interviews. Complete data were available for 39 management consultants, 53.8% male and aged between 23 and 56 years (M = 38.0; SD = 9.2). The data were subjected to content analysis. Representation of the associations and latent constructs were analysed by a multiple correspondence analysis. Results indicated that 'intellectual disturber' (31.4%) was the most referred SPoOS, 'high workload' (15.1%) was identified as the most prevalent perceived SoS and 'coaching' (19.0%) was the most mentioned SMS. No significant differences between the two gender groups were found regarding the three total scores. SPoOS was explained by a two-factor model: 'organization-oriented' and 'person-oriented'. A three-dimension model formed by 'job concerns', 'organizational constraints' and 'career expectations' was indicated as a best-fit solution for SoS, and SMS was best explained in a three-dimension model by 'group dynamics strategies', 'organizational culture strategies' and 'individual support strategies'. This research makes a unique contribution for a better understanding of what defines SPoOS, SoS and SMS for management consultants.

248,A self-determination theory approach to understanding stress incursion and responses,"Given the high costs of stress for both mental and physical health, understanding of how stress is incurred and how it is coped with has both theoretical and clinical significance. Self-determination theory (SDT), a broad framework for understanding motivation and personality, speaks to many issues concerning stress-related phenomena. Research based on SDT suggests that both less stress incursion and better coping with demanding events are associated with greater autonomous functioning, higher mindfulness, more interest-taking in internal events, and lifestyles focused on pursuing intrinsic over extrinsic goals, among other factors. These topics are discussed within the growing body of empirical research stemming from SDT and linkages are drawn with the larger literature on stress and coping.

249,Protective benefits of mindfulness in emergency room personnel,"Background Recent meta-analyses have found that mindfulness practice may reduce anxiety and depression in clinical populations and there is growing evidence that mindfulness may also improve well-being and quality of care in health professionals. This study examined whether mindfulness protects against the impact of work-related stress on mental health and burnout in emergency room (ER) nurses. Methods ER nurses (N=50) were recruited from an urban teaching hospital in Switzerland and completed a survey on work-related stressors, mindfulness, burnout, depression, and anxiety. Results: The most frequently reported work-related stressor was interpersonal conflict. Nurses working more consecutive days since last taking time off were at greater risk for depression and those reporting more work-related interpersonal conflicts were at greater risk for burnout. Mindfulness was associated with reduced anxiety, depression, and burnout. Mindfulness was a significant predictor of anxiety, depression, and burnout and moderated the impact of work-related stressors on mental health and burnout. Limitations The sample is limited to nurses and results need to be replicated in other groups (e.g., medical staff or ambulance workers). We assessed clinical symptoms with questionnaires and it would be desirable to repeat this assessment with clinical diagnostic interviews. Conclusions: The findings have implications for stress management in ER nurses and health professionals working in comparable settings (e.g., urgent care). The robust associations between mindfulness and multiple indices of psychological well-being suggest that ER staff exposed to high levels of occupational stress may benefit from mindfulness practice to increase resistance to mental health problems and burnout.

We examined the associations between teacher-children relationship quality and the level of three types of perceived workplace stress: high demands, low control, and low support. Findings indicated that more workplace stress was associated with more conflict in teacher-children relationships. Interventions to address workplace stress should be evaluated for their potential to impact teacher-children relationship quality and children's social-emotional development.

251,Fish consumption and resilience to depression in Japanese company workers: a cross-sectional study,"Background: Depression is a common disorder that is influenced by psychosocial factors in the workplace. Increasing resilience, the ability to cope with stress in the face of adversity, is considered an important strategy to prevent depression. It has been suggested that consumption of fish, which is a major source of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA), may prevent depression. However, associations between depression, resilience, and fish consumption have not been documented. The aim of the study is to investigate the association between fish consumption and resilience to depression.Methods: Participants were 527 Japanese employees at three worksites of a large company. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale was administered to assess depressive symptoms, and the 14-item Resilience Scale (RS-14) was administered to assess resilience. A self-report questionnaire extracted from the Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to measure fish consumption frequency. Regression analyses were conducted to assess a mediation model based on a statistical analysis framework defined by Baron and Kenny. The indirect association of resilience was calculated with the bootstrapping method. Each analysis was adjusted by age, sex, marital status, work position, and educational background.Results: The association between fish consumption frequency and total CES-D score was significant (B = -0.94; p = 0.011). The association between fish consumption frequency and total RS-14 score was significant (B = 1.4; p = 0.010), as was association total RS-14 score and the total CES-D score (B = -0.34; p < 0.001). When controlling for total RS-14 score, there was no longer a significant association between fish consumption frequency and total CES-D score. The bootstrapping results revealed that significant indirect association though fish consumption frequency and total CES-D score (bias corrected and accelerated confidence interval = -0.83 to -0.13; 95 % confidence interval) through total RS-14 score.Conclusions: Fish consumption might be associated with resilience to depression. Further studies are needed, particularly double blind randomized placebo controlled intervention trials on the potential preventative effect of LC n-3 PUFA on resilience to depression.","Yoshikawa, Eisho; Nishi, Daisuke; Matsuoka, Yutaka",0,10.1186/s12944-015-0048-8,205
252,Prevalence of psychological symptoms in contemporary Chinese rural-to-urban migrant workers: An exploratory meta-analysis of observational studies using the SCL-90-R,"Purpose: (1) To estimate the pooled prevalence of psychological symptoms in Chinese migrant workers (CMWs), as measured using the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) in observational studies conducted in China, and (2) to explore the potential variables associated with the SCL-90-R Global Severity Index (GSI), the overall mental health indicator of CMWs. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search of the major English and Chinese databases (to June 2012). Cross-sectional surveys and case-control studies of CMWs (and controls where appropriate) that reported at least one subscale score of the SCL-90-R were included. Multilevel meta-analysis was used to pool the symptom scores of cross-sectional surveys and mean differences of symptom scores (""Cohen's d"" values) between CMWs and controls of case-control studies. Multilevel meta-analysis with ecological- or study-level covariates was used to explore the associations between variables and SCL-90-R GSI score. Results: The search yielded 48 cross-sectional surveys (comprising 42,813 CMWs) and seven surveys that included control samples. The pooled psychological symptom scores (95 % confidence interval) of CMWs were statistically higher than those of norms from Chinese general population on all scales of SCL-90-R, except for obsessive-compulsive subscale in study quality subgroup analysis. CMWs also scored statistically higher than those of urban counterpart controls on all scales of SCL-90-R. Multilevel regression meta-analysis model revealed that four covariates that accounted for 33.9 % of SCL-90-R GSI heterogeneity across all surveys, including: ""mean age of study sample,"" ""geographic area,"" ""per capita GDP,"" and ""statutory minimum monthly wage"" of study site in implementation year. Conclusion: CMWs have more severe psychological symptoms than the general population, and thus, appear to experience higher level of psychological distress. Macro-economic factors may have impact on the overall mental health of CMWs, but the factors that contribute to mental health and mental distress among CMWs remain to be explored and understood.

254,Teachersâ€™ dispositional mindfulness and the quality of their relationships with children in Head Start classrooms,"The quality of teachersâ€™ relationships with children is a key predictor of children's later social emotional competence and academic achievement. Interventions to increase mindfulness among teachers have focused primarily on the impacts on teachersâ€™ subjective well-being, but not on the quality of their relationships with children. Furthermore, none of these interventions have involved preschool teachers. To consider the potential of mindfulness-based interventions to improve the quality of teachersâ€™ relationships with preschool-aged children, we examined data from an online survey of 1001 classroom teachers in 37 Pennsylvania Head Start Programs. Using path analysis we investigated the association between teachersâ€™ dispositional mindfulness and the quality of their relationships with children (conflict and closeness). We further examined whether this association was mediated by teacher depressive symptoms and moderated by perceived workplace stress. Higher levels of dispositional mindfulness among teachers were associated with higher quality relationships with children (less conflict and greater closeness). The association between greater dispositional mindfulness and less conflict was partially mediated by lower depressive symptoms, and the conditional direct effect of mindfulness on conflict was stronger when perceived workplace stress was lower. These findings suggest that preschool teachers who have higher levels of dispositional mindfulness may experience higher quality relationships with children in their classrooms. Interventions to increase levels of dispositional mindfulness among early childhood educators may improve their well-being along with the quality of their relationships with children, potentially impacting children's educational outcomes. The potential impacts of such interventions may be even stronger if structural and systemic changes are also made to reduce workplace stress.

A secondary aim was to assess the feasibility of Walks4Work in terms of adherence, change in PA levels, and cardiovascular health parameters.Methods In an 8-week randomized control trial, 94 office workers in an international company were allocated to one of three groups: control, nature (NW), or built (BW) lunchtime walking route. Both walking groups were required to undertake two lunchtime walks each week. The NW route centered around trees, maintained grass, and public footpaths. In contrast, the BW consisted of pavement routes through housing estates and industrial areas. Data were collected at baseline and following the intervention. To investigate the impact of the intervention, mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed.Results A total of 73 participants completed the intervention (drop-out rate of 22%). No difference was observed in resting autonomic function between the groups. Self-reported mental health improved for the NW group only. PA levels increased at the intervention mid-point for all groups combined but adherence to the intervention was low with rates of 42% and 43% within the BW and NW groups, respectively.Conclusion Accompanying a guideline of two active lunchtimes per week with low facilitator input appears inadequate for increasing the number of active lunchtimes and modifying cardiovascular health parameters in an office population. However, this population fell within normal ranges for cardiovascular measures and future research should consider investigating at-risk populations, particularly hypertensive individuals.","Brown, Daniel K.; Barton, Jo L.; Pretty, Jules; Gladwell, Valerie F.",1,10.5271/sjweh.3421,209
258,A Non-Randomised Feasibility Trial Assessing the Efficacy of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention for Teachers to Reduce Stress and Improve Well-Being,"Teacher stress is a serious and endemic concern. Mindfulness-based interventions show promise in reducing stress and increasing well-being by cultivating mindfulness and self-compassion. This feasibility trial evaluated a mindfulness-based programme customised for teachers. A sample of 89 secondary school teachers and staff were recruited and self-selected into the intervention (n = 49) or comparison (n = 40) conditions. Participants were asked to complete self-reports which measured stress (PSS), well-being (WEMWBS), mindfulness (FFMQ), and self-compassion (SCS; Kindness and Self-Judgement) at baseline and after the completion of the intervention. Results revealed that individuals in the intervention condition reported significant reductions in stress, and significant increases in well-being post-intervention in comparison to their counterparts in the comparison group. There was an observed large effect (Î·p 2 >.14) for the intervention on all outcome measures, an effect that was maintained when controlling for baseline differences between the intervention and comparison groups. Furthermore, the majority (95Â %) of teachers who attended the course found it to be acceptable. These results indicate that a customised mindfulness-based programme for teachers is a promising approach to reducing stress and increasing well-being, mindfulness, and self-compassion among secondary school teachers. However, the results of the current study are preliminary and the next phase of work will involve extending to a larger scale randomised controlled trial.

260,Work-related stress and reward: An Australian study of multidisciplinary pediatric oncology healthcare providers,"Objective Managing staff stress and preventing long-term burnout in oncology staff are highly important for both staff and patient well-being. Research addressing work-related stress in adult oncology is well documented; however, less is known about this topic in the pediatric context. This study examined sources of work-related stress and reward specific to multidisciplinary staff working in pediatric oncology in Australia. Method Participants were 107 pediatric oncology clinicians, including medical, nursing, and allied health staff from two Australian pediatric oncology centers. Participants completed an online survey using two newly developed measures: the work stressors scale-pediatric oncology and the work rewards scale-pediatric oncology. Results The most commonly reported sources of both stress and reward are related to patient care and interactions with children. Results indicated that levels of work-related stress and reward were similar between the professional disciplines and between the two hospitals. Regression analyses revealed no demographic or organizational factors that were associated with either stress or reward. Conclusions Work-related stress and reward are not mutually exclusive; particular situations and events can be simultaneously stressful and rewarding for healthcare providers. Although patient care and interactions with children was found to be the most stressful aspect of working in this speciality, it was also the greatest source of reward. Results are discussed in relation to workplace approaches to staff well-being and stress reduction. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

262,Enhancing well-being at work: The role of emotion regulation skills as personal resources,"Dealing with negative emotions is a crucial work demand, particularly for employees in health care. Job resources (e.g., autonomy, social support, or reward) but also personal resources (such as emotion regulation strategies) might reduce job stress and support well-being. Following this, the present study focused on strengthening emotion regulation as 1 way of dealing with high job demands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of a standardized emotion regulation training (Affect Regulation Training [ART]; Berking, 2010) to improve emotion regulation skills and well-being of employees in elderly health care. Therefore, 96 elderly care workers filled out an established questionnaire of emotion regulation skills as well as a measure of well-being at pretreatment, posttreatment and at 6-month follow-up. The findings show that the ART fosters emotion regulation skills. In particularly, acceptance, tolerance, and modification of negative emotions was enhanced in the training groups in comparison to a control-group. Modification, meaning the ability to actively change emotions, improved even more over the follow-up-period. Simultaneously, well-being of participants increased over all measurement time points in the ART-group compared with the control-group. Additionally, the improvement in emotion regulation skills from pre to posttreatment was related to well-being at follow-up. In summary, our results support the ART as an effective intervention for dealing with negative emotions and to enhance well-being among employees in elderly care.

264,"Perspectives on a 'Sit Less, Move More' Intervention in Australian Emergency Call Centres","Background: Prolonged sitting is associated with increased risk of chronic diseases. Workplace programs that aim to reduce sitting time (sit less) and increase physical activity (move more) have targeted desk-based workers in corporate and university settings with promising results. However, little is known about, move more, sit less. programs for workers in other types of jobs and industries, such as shift workers. This formative research examines the perceptions of a, sit less, move more. program in an Australian Emergency Call Centre that operates 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Methods: Participants were employees (N = 39, 72% female, 50% aged 36-55 years) recruited from Emergency Services control centres located in New South Wales, Australia. The, sit less, move more. intervention, consisting of emails, posters and timer lights, was co-designed with the management team and tailored to the control centre environment and work practices, which already included electronic height-adjustable sit-stand workstations for all call centre staff. Participants reported their perceptions and experiences of the intervention in a self-report online questionnaire, and directly to the research team during regular site visits. Questionnaire topics included barriers and facilitators to standing while working, mental wellbeing, effects on work performance, and workplace satisfaction. Field notes and open-ended response data were analysed in an iterative process during and after data collection to identify the main themes. Results: Whilst participants already had sit-stand workstations, use of the desks in the standing position varied and sometimes were contrary to expectations (e.g, less tired standing than sitting; standing when experiencing high call stress). Participants emphasised the "" challenging"" and "" unrelenting"" nature of their work. They reported sleep issues (""always tired""), work stress (""non-stop demands""), and feeling mentally and physically drained due to shift work and length of shifts. Overall, participants liked the initiative but acknowledged that their predominantly sitting habits were entrenched and work demands took precedence. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the low acceptability of a, sit less, move more. program in shift workers in high stress environments like emergency call centres. Work demands take priority and other health concerns, like poor sleep and high stress, may be more salient than the need to sit less and move more during work shifts.","Chau, Josephine Y.; Engelen, Lina; Burks-Young, Sarah; Daley, Michelle; Maxwell, Jen-Kui; Milton, Karen; Bauman, Adrian",0,10.3934/publichealth.2016.2.288,213
265,A Pilot Study Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Mindfulness-Based Intervention on Cortisol Awakening Response and Health Outcomes among Law Enforcement Officers,"As first responders who are frequently exposed to job-related trauma, police officers are at an elevated risk of adverse mental and physical health outcomes. Evidence-based approaches to stress reduction are sorely needed to address the complex variety of problems that police officers face. In this pilot study we examined the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a mindfulness-based intervention designed to address police officer stress. A total of 43 police officers completed an 8-week Mindfulness-Based Resilience Training (MBRT) program, which was designed to improve mindfulness, resilience, stress, health outcomes, and emotional functioning. Using multilevel models we found significant improvement in self-reported mindfulness, resilience, police and perceived stress, burnout, emotional intelligence, difficulties with emotion regulation, mental health, physical health, anger, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Although there were no significant pre-to-post-MBRT changes in cortisol awakening response (CAR), while controlling for pre-MBRT increase area under the curve (AUCI), change in mental health was a significant predictor of post-AUCI. Implications of these findings and areas for future research are discussed.

268,The Influence of Trait-Negative Affect and Compassion Satisfaction on Compassion Fatigue in Australian Nurses,"For this study, we examined the nature of the unique relationships trait-negative affect and compassion satisfaction had with compassion fatigue and its components of secondary traumatic stress and burnout in 273 nurses from 1 metropolitan tertiary acute hospital in Western Australia. Participants completed the Professional Quality of Life Scale (Stamm, 2010), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (Lovibond and Lovibond, 2004), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, and Jacobs, 1983). Bivariate correlation and hierarchical regression analyses were performed to examine and investigate 4 hypotheses. The results demonstrate a clear differential pattern of relationships with secondary traumatic stress and burnout for both trait-negative affect and compassion satisfaction. Trait-negative affect was clearly the more important factor in terms of its contribution to overall compassion fatigue and secondary traumatic stress. In contrast, compassion satisfactionas unique protective relationship only related to burnout, and not secondary traumatic stress. The results are therefore consistent with the view that compassion satisfaction may be an important internal resource that protects against burnout, but is not directly influential in protecting against secondary traumatic stress for nurses working in an acute-care hospital environment. With the projected nursing workforce shortages in Australia, it is apparent that a further understanding is warranted of how such personal variables may work as protective and risk factors.

269,"Mindful2Work: Effects of Combined Physical Exercise, Yoga, and Mindfulness Meditations for Stress Relieve in Employees. A Proof of Concept Study","Work-related stress and associated illness and burnout is rising in western society, with now as much as almost a quarter of European and half of USAâ€™s employees estimated to be at the point of burnout. Mindfulness meditation, yoga, and physical exercise have all shown beneficial effects for work-related stress and illness. This proof of concept study assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the newly developed Mindful2Work training, a combination of physical exercise, restorative yoga, and mindfulness meditations, delivered in six weekly group sessions plus a follow-up session. Participants (n = 26, four males), referred by company doctors with (work-related) stress and burnout complaints, completed measurements pre and post the intervention, as well as at 6-week (FU1) and 6-month (FU2) follow-up. Results showed very high feasibility and acceptability of the Mindful2Work training. The training and trainers were rated with an 8.1 and 8.4 on a 1â€“10 scale, respectively, and training dropout rate was zero. Significant improvements with (very) large effect sizes were demonstrated for the primary outcome measures of physical and mental workability, and for anxiety, depression, stress, sleep quality, positive and negative affect, which remained (very) large and mostly increased further over time. Risk for long-term dropout from work (checklist individual strength [CIS]) was 92Â % at pre-test, reduced to 67Â % at post-test, to 44Â % at FU1, and 35Â % at FU2, whereas employees worked (RTWI) 65Â % of their contract hours per week at pre-test, which increased to 73Â % at post-test, 81Â % at FU1 and 93Â % at FU2. Intensity of home practice or number of attended sessions were not related to training effects. To conclude, the newly developed Mindful2Work training seems very feasible, and acceptable, and although no control group was included, the large effects of Mindful2Work are highly promising.

270,IMPLEMENTATION OF A MINDFULNESS MOMENT INITIATIVE FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS: PERCEPTIONS OF FACILITATORS,"Context: Mindfulness practices in the workplace have experienced rapid growth, with initial evidence suggesting positive outcomes. Even so, little is known about implementing mindfulness-based interventions (MBI), especially internally driven programs led by volunteers rather than experts.Objective: This study qualitatively explores volunteer facilitators' perceptions of a short-dose MBI (the mindfulness moment initiative) before and 6 weeks after implementation.Methods: Mindfulness moments were 1-3-minute-guided periods of mindfulness led at the beginning of various staff meetings at an inner-city community medical center. Facilitators' perceptions were collected through thirty-one 30-minute semi-structured interviews before and after the MMI's first 6 weeks. Categorizing and connecting strategies were employed to explore the emergence of themes and patterns across responses.Results: Mindfulness moment facilitators interviewed before the intervention expected their groups to experience several intra- and interpersonal benefits. After implementation, they perceived all of these benefits to have occurred, but some benefits were mentioned more frequently before than after implementation and vice versa. Five of six expected obstacles were reported after implementation, with timing issues emerging as the most frequently mentioned theme. Facilitators believed that benefits outweighed obstacles. Our data also suggested that mindfulness moments may provide managers with an additional way to address moments of tension occurring between co-workers. Most facilitators intended to continue leading mindfulness moments and wished to expand the practice to new departments.Conclusion: The mindfulness moment intervention may provide a way to bring mindfulness into organizations that is not dependent on formal training programs, a large time commitment, or a commitment to extended training. Prior knowledge of the obstacles and benefits found here may result in a more successful intervention.","Duggan, Karen; Julliard, Kell",0,10.1016/j.explore.2017.09.009,218

The paper is conceptual and qualitative in nature in which Yogic technique- Yoga Nidra has been used as a stress management intervention strategy. This study is based on the content analysis of the similar researches already conducted in the past and also the interviews of the employees practising Yoga Nidra and has drawn useful inferences regarding the role of Yoga Nidra in managing the employees' stress at the workplace. It has been found that Yoga Nidra has a great potential to mitigate the stress level among the people. The paper also gives new insight to the organizations where effective mechanism of Yoga Nidra increases the parasympathetic system and decreases the sympathetic system which results into physical, mental and emotional relaxation in our body.","Dwivedi M.K., Singh S.K.",0,,219
272,Teachers' emotion regulation skills facilitate implementation of health-related intentions,"Objectives: Many teachers report high levels of job-related stress. Successful outcomes in stress-management trainings depend on participants actively engaging in skill-building exercises. However, despite good intentions to engage in such exercises on a regular basis, many participants ultimately fail to do so. The present study seeks to understand whether general emotion regulation (ER) skills moderate the relation between the intention to engage in skill-building exercises and actually engaging in these exercises. Methods: ER skills, the intention to engage in autonomous skill-building exercises, and the extent to which individuals actually engaged in such exercises were assessed in a sample of 119 teachers participating in stress-management training. Results: ER skills significantly moderated the association between the intention and engagement in skill-building practice. The greater the ER skills, the more coupled was the relation between the intention and actual practices. Conclusion: Findings are consistent with the hypotheses. Thus, skill-building trainings should support participants scoring low in ER skills in effectively coping with aversive affective states cued through skill-building exercises.

276,Obese Employee Participation Patterns in a Wellness Program,"The purpose of this research was to retrospectively examine whether demographic differences exist between those who participated in an employee wellness program and those who did not, and to identify the selection of employees' choice in weight management activities. A nonequivalent, 2-group retrospective design was used. This study involved employees at a large, not-for-profit integrated health system. Of the total organization employee pool (29,194), 19,771 (68%) employees volunteered to be weighed (mean body mass index [BMI]=28.9) as part of an employee wellness program. Weight management activities available included: (1) Self-directed 5% total body weight loss; (2) Healthy Solutions at home; (3) Weight Watchers group meetings; (4) Weight Watchers online; and (5) Employee Assistance Program (EAP)-directed healthy weight coaching. Measures were participation rate and available weight management activity participation rate among obese employees across demographic variables, including sex, age, race, job type, and job location. The analysis included chi-square tests for all categorical variables; odds ratios were calculated to examine factors predictive of participation. Of the total 19,771 employees weighed, 6375 (32%) employees were obese (defined as BMI 30); of those, 3094 (49%) participated in available weight management activities. Participation was higher among females, whites, those ages >50 years, and non-nursing staff. In conclusion, participation rate varied significantly based on demographic variables. Self-directed 5% weight loss was the most popular weight management activity selected.

277,"Enhancing the resilience of nurses and midwives: Pilot of a mindfulness-based program for increased health, sense of coherence and decreased depression, anxiety and stress","Health workers in general, and midwives and nurses in particular, experience high levels of stress/ distress due to the nature of their work and workplaces; and, their socialization into ways of working that minimizes the likelihood of self-care. Increasing interest in the development of resilient workers has meant an enormous growth in interest in the role of holistic practices such as mindfulness meditation. Kabat-Zinn's mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is one of the most commonly used by those seeking to practise, theorize or research mindfulness across multiple contexts. The primary aim of this study was to pilot the effectiveness of an adapted mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention on the psychological wellbeing of nurses and midwives. More specifically,we sought to test the acceptability and feasibility of a modified MBSR intervention to inform a future randomized controlled trial (RCT). The pilot study used a pre and post intervention design. Twenty midwives and 20 nurses participated in a one-day workshop, undertook to meditate daily for 8 weeks and completed pre and post intervention measures: general health questionnaire (GHQ-12); sense of coherence (SOC) -orientation to life and the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS). A subgroup took part in interviews or focus group discussions of their experiences of the program and their ongoing mindfulness practice. The quantitative findings included significant improvements on the GHQ-12, SOC and the stress subscale of the DASS. Qualitative findings support the acceptability of the intervention, and highlighted a number of issues related to feasibility of any future RCT. In conclusion, mindfulness practice holds promise for increasing individual and workplace resilience, however, meaningful research evidence from carefully constructed studies will be required to engage and motivate participation and organizational support.","Foureur, Maralyn; Besley, Karyn; Burton, Geraldine; Yu, Nickolas; Crisp, Jackie",0,10.5172/conu.2013.45.1.114,223
278,"Work-site wellness programmes in Sweden: a cross-sectional study of physical activity, self-efficacy, and health","In Sweden, a work-site wellness programme implies reimbursing some of the expenses for health-promoting activities. Although work-site wellness programmes are readily available in Sweden, a large number of employees elect not to participate. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of physical activity, self-reported general health assessment and self-efficacy with participation in a work-site wellness programme. Study design: A cross-sectional study design was used. Methods: An online questionnaire was distributed to employees of a manufacturing company with 2500 employees in southwest Sweden. Results: Those who took advantage of the work-site wellness programme assessed their general health as better and had higher assessment of physical activity. The study showed that being enlisted also implies a higher level of physical activity and general health; however, the effect sizes of these correlations were small. Self-efficacy, i.e. perceived behavioural control, was not associated with participation in the work-site wellness programme. However, self-efficacy was correlated with both general health assessment and physical activity. A regression analysis to determine explanatory contributions to the general health assessment score showed no significant contribution from participation in a work-site wellness programme, but was instead explained by perceived behavioural control and physical activity. Conclusions: Given the small effect size of the difference in physical activity between participators and non-participators in the work-site wellness programme, it is probable that only a small proportion of participators changed their health-promoting activities as a result of the work-site wellness programme.

Little is known about the impact of traumatic material on VHA providers. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between trauma content, patient characteristics, and burnout among VHA PTSD Clinical Team (PCT) providers. It was hypothesized that trauma content and patient characteristics would significantly predict burnout in this population. Design This cross-sectional study consisted of 137 participants. The sample was mostly female (67%), Caucasian (non-Hispanic; 81%), and married (70%) with a mean age of 44.3 years (SD = 11.3). Methods Participants completed an electronic survey that assessed demographics, patient characteristics (i.e., anger, personality disorder, malingering), trauma content characteristics (e.g., killing of women and children) as well as burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS; Maslach et al., 1996, Burnout inventory manual. Palo Alto: Consulting Psychologist Press). Results Over half of the study population reported being bothered by trauma content; however, trauma content did not predict burnout. Treating patients with personality disorders and suspected malingering predicted burnout in PCT providers. High numbers (77%) reported perceiving that emotional exhaustion impacted the quality of care they provided. Conclusion These findings suggest an important role of burnout assessment, prevention, and treatment strategies at the VHA.

280,The Incorporation of Stress Management Programming Into Family Medicine Residencies-Results of a National Survey of Residency Directors: A CERA Study,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Residents' stress and burnout is a concern among family medicine residency programs. Our objective is to assess stress management options available to family medicine residents. METHODS: In 2012, the Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) e-mailed a survey to US residency directors. Questions were asked on four types of stress management programming (SMP): (1) access to counselors, social workers, or mental health providers, (2) residency support or Balint groups, (3) stress management lectures or workshops, and (4) residency retreats. We assessed how many programs contained all four types of SMP and their relationship to the following topics: stress management techniques for patients, spirituality, mind/body techniques, and self-care for residents. RESULTS: Of the 212 responses, 29% reported having all four types of SMR Eighty-three percent reported stress management lectures or workshops, and 79% reported residency retreats. Smaller and mid-size residencies (36%) and residencies in the West (36%) were more likely to have all four types of SMP. There was a correlation between having didactics, clinical rotations, and electives on stress management techniques for patient care and having stress management lectures or workshops for residents. There was statistical significance between having resident self-care curriculum and (1) having retreats and (2) stress management lectures or workshops.

281,Interactive effects of work psychosocial factors on participation in workplace wellness programs,"This study explored concurrent effects of six work psychosocial factors on current participation and the self-reported likelihood of future participation in workplace wellness programs using a cross-sectional survey, an ad hoc focus group, and structured interviews. Classification and regression tree analysis was used to analyze survey responses from 343 employees (194 nonparticipants, 95 participants, and 54 engaged participants). A thematic analysis of focus group (n = 7) and interview (n = 5) narratives was also undertaken. In combination with high work control, high superior support was associated with an engaged participant profile. Job demand was the third important variable with low and very high levels associated with participation. With regard to high likelihood of future participation, among respondents with age older than 50, high predictability of occupational activities and control were identified as a significant factor, and among others, high superior support and control. The analysis of narratives revealed peer relations and flexible working hours to be positively linked to participation and general job stress was identified as having a bidirectional relationship. Employees stated that stress led them to take advantage of these programs as a source of relief and that their availability/participation has contributed to lowering their stress. These findings inform practitioners about the importance of addressing poor psychosocial factors as a participation barrier and having a holistic approach to employee well-being.

283,The relationship between perceived organisational threat and compassion for others: Implications for the NHS,"The National Health Service (NHS) is known to be a challenging place to work, with financial and performance targets placing increasing pressure on the organisation. This study aimed to investigate whether these pressures and threats might be detrimental to the quality of care and the compassion that the NHS strives to deliver. Quantitative data were collected via self-report questionnaires from healthcare professionals across 3 NHS trusts in England in order to measure Self-compassion; Compassion for Others; Perceived Organisational Threat; and Perceived Organisational Compassion. Qualitative data were also collected to explore the threats considered most pertinent to healthcare professionals at present. The key findings suggest thatÂ an increase in Perceived Organisational Threat may reduce an individual's ability to give compassion to others; however, Self-compassion and Perceived Organisational Compassion were better predictors of Compassion for Others. This highlights the need to consider compassion at a systemic level, providing interventions and training not only to cultivate self-compassion in healthcare professionals, but also to encourage compassion across the NHS more generally. In promoting self-compassion and increasing the level of compassion that employees feel they receive at work, healthcare professionals may be better able to maintain or improve their level of compassion for service users and colleagues.

284,Effects of a stress management program for hospital staffs on their coping strategies and interpersonal behaviors,"The present study examined effects of a 3-h stress management program for Japanese hospital staffs that included relaxation and assertion training. Twenty-seven hospital staffs (mean age: 29.4 yr) in a stress management group and 28 hospital staffs (mean age: 29.5 yr) in a wait-list group answered evaluation surveys at both pre- and post-intervention. Self-administered questionnaires including items on job stress, coping strategies, and interpersonal behaviors were evaluated. The stress management program was given six different participant groups: 3 groups were the stress management group and 3 groups were the wait-list group. The program increased active coping and decreased dependent behavior scores significantly in the stress management group, while decreasing assertive behavior scores in the wait-list group. A comparison of the education sub-groups showed that the first group had significantly increased assertiveness and decreased dependency scores. The second group had significantly decreased depression-anxiety scores. The data analyzed for men and women separately showed the stress management intervention significantly improved active coping and assertive behavior in men and dependent behavior in women. A brief one-time stress management program can be effective in improving active coping and assertive behaviors as well as reducing dependent behavior in hospital staffs.

Methods: We analyze a nationally representative survey on workplace wellness programs from 407 employers using cluster analysis and multivariable regression analysis. Results: Employers who offer incentives and provide a comprehensive set of program offerings have higher participation rates. The effect of incentives differs by program configuration, with the strongest effect found for comprehensive and prevention-focused programs. Among intervention-focused programs, incentives are not associated with higher participation. Conclusions: Wellness programs can be grouped into distinct configurations, which have different workplace health focuses. Although monetary incentives can be effective in improving employee participation, the magnitude and significance of the effect is greater for some program configurations than others.","Huang, HJ; Mattke, S; Batorsky, B; Miles, J; Liu, HS; Taylor, E",0,10.1097/JOM.0000000000000613,231

287,High perceived stress is associated with unfavorable eating behavior in overweight and obese Finns of working age,"Stress-related eating may be a potential factor in the obesity epidemic. Rather little is known about how stress associates with eating behavior and food intake in overweight individuals in a free-living situation. Thus, the present study aims to investigate this question in psychologically distressed overweight and obese working-aged Finns. The study is a cross-sectional baseline analysis of a randomized controlled trial. Of the 339 study participants, those with all the needed data available (n = 297, 84% females) were included. The mean age was 48.9 y (SD = 7.6) and mean body mass index 31.3 kg/m2 (SD = 3.0). Perceived stress and eating behavior were assessed by self-reported questionnaires Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Intuitive Eating Scale, the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, Health and Taste Attitude Scales and ecSatter Inventory. Diet and alcohol consumption were assessed by 48-h dietary recall, Index of Diet Quality, and AUDIT-C. Individuals reporting most perceived stress (i.e. in the highest PSS tertile) had less intuitive eating, more uncontrolled eating, and more emotional eating compared to those reporting less perceived stress (p < 0.05). Moreover, individuals in the highest PSS tertile reported less cognitive restraint and less eating competence than those in the lowest tertile (p < 0.05). Intake of whole grain products was the lowest among those in the highest PSS tertile (p < 0.05). Otherwise the quality of diet and alcohol consumption did not differ among the PSS tertiles. In conclusion, high perceived stress was associated with the features of eating behavior that could in turn contribute to difficulties in weight management. Stress-related way of eating could thus form a potential risk factor for obesity. More research is needed to develop efficient methods for clinicians to assist in handling stress-related eating in the treatment of obese people.

288,A Pilot Study of Mindfulness Skills to Reduce Stress among a Diverse Paraprofessional Workforce,"Paraprofessional workforces are becoming more common and can serve the otherwise unmet needs of diverse children and families. Compared to other workforces, limited research to date has explored factors such as stress and burnout that influence the sustainability of this workforce. Mindfulness-based interventions have been studied as stress-reduction programs for other workforces, but it is currently unknown whether mindfulness is acceptable to paraprofessionals, particularly those of a diverse ethnicity living in low-income, urban environments. The current investigation is a pilot study examining whether six weeks of mindfulness-based skills training can reduce stress, burnout, and improve sleep quality among a diverse paraprofessional workforce. Twenty six paraprofessionals (ages 24â€“58, M = 37.04, SD = 9.65) completed measures pre-training, post-training, and at a four week follow-up. Results indicated that this paraprofessional workforce found mindfulness practices acceptable and experienced significant reductions in perceived stress and emotional exhaustion, as well as improved sleep quality (p <.05) Mindfulness-based interventions may be useful in supporting the wellbeing of paraprofessionals from diverse backgrounds working in low-income, urban environments.

It utilizes the RE-AIM evaluation framework to capture the Reach and Adoption of the intervention in the companies, the appraisal of the Implementation process and the project's Effectiveness and Maintenance with a range of qualitative and quantitative methods. It applies an adapted research design in the context of a field study involving entire organizations, retrospectively assigning study participants to comparison groups. The results of a longitudinal analysis (n = 1400) showed that the SMI had a positive impact on the participants' job demands and resources, when controlled for baseline levels. Qualitative data analysis revealed that the companies had built capacities for ongoing health promotion and showed what issues must be borne in mind when implementing such projects. The study also showed that participation in such interventions alone does not suffice to achieve the desired impact, but that the individual participants' appraisal of the intervention and the collective involvement of the teams must be further researched to fully understand how change occurs.","Jenny, GJ; Brauchli, R; Inauen, A; Fullemann, D; Fridrich, A; Bauer, GF",0,10.1093/heapro/dat091,235

This study analysed physiological markers of stress and self-reported emotion regulation strategies in a group of middle school teachers over 1Â year. Chronic physiological stress was assessed with diurnal cortisol measures at three time points over 1Â year (fall, spring, fall). The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate the changes in educators' physiological level of stress. Results indicate that compared to those in the fall, cortisol awakening responses were blunted in the spring. Further, this effect was ameliorated by the summer break. Additionally, self-reported use of the emotion regulation strategy reappraisal buffered the observed blunting that occurred in the spring.

We divided 140 civil servants into two groups (an intervention group and a waiting list control group), and carried out three sessions with the intervention group at intervals of four weeks. The sessions included lectures on responses to stress and coping skills, problem-solving training, group discussions and self-monitoring. Data from 65 subjects in the intervention group and 63 subjects in the waiting list group were analyzed using two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The intervention group showed statistically significant development of problem-solving skills and positive cognition, with a significant effect remaining one month after the intervention. The effect sizes in the intervention group showed a small-to-medium change in problem-solving coping and small changes in positive cognitive coping. However, no interventional effects were seen in terms of response to stress and health competence. As the number of existing studies on job stress management for workers is limited, further research in this field is necessary, including examination of the frequency and methods of intervention sessions, the effects of intervention by gender, etc.","Kawaharada, Mariko; Yoshioka, Eiji; Saijo, Yasuaki; Fukui, Tomonori; Ueno, Takeji; Kishi, Reiko",0,10.2486/indhealth.47.173,238

297,A workplace mindfulness intervention may be associated with improved psychological well-being and productivity. A preliminary field study in a company setting,"Background: Mindfulness trainings are increasingly offered in workplace environments in order to improve health and productivity. Whilst promising, there is limited research on the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions in workplace settings. Objective: To examine the feasibility and effectiveness of a Workplace Mindfulness Training (WMT) in terms of burnout, psychological well-being, organizational and team climate, and performance. Methods: This is a preliminary field study in four companies. Self-report questionnaires were administered up to a month before, at start of, and right at the end of the WMT, resulting in a pre-intervention and an intervention period. There was no separate control group. A total of 425 participants completed the surveys on the different time points. Linear mixed model analyses were used to analyze the data. Results: When comparing the intervention period with the pre-intervention period, significantly greater improvements were found in measures of burnout (mean difference = 0.3, p < 0.001), perceived stress (mean difference = -0.2, p < 0.001), mindfulness [mean difference = 1.0 for the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI) and 0.8 for the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), both p < 0.001], and well-being (mean difference = 0.4, p < 0.001). Additionally, greater increases in team climate, organizational climate and personal performance were reported during the intervention compared to the pre-intervention period with largest improvements in team cooperation (mean difference = 0.3, p < 0.001), productivity (mean difference = 0.5, p < 0.001), and stress (mean difference = -0.4, p < 0.001). Effect sizes were large for mindfulness (d > 0.8), moderate for well-being, burnout and perceived stress (d = 0.5-0.8), and ranged from low to moderate for organizational and team climate and personal performance (d = 0.2-0.8). Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that compared to the pre-intervention period, the intervention period was associated with greater reductions in burnout and perceived stress, improvements in mindfulness, well-being, and increases in team and organizational climate and personal performance. Due to design limitations, no conclusions can be drawn on the extent to which the WMT or non-specific factors such as time have contributed to the findings. Further studies, preferably using randomized controlled designs with longer follow up periods are needed to evaluate whether the associations found can be attributed to the WMT and whether these sustain after the training.

298,Green exercise as a workplace intervention to reduce job stress. Results from a pilot study,"BACKGROUND: Stress and mental fatigue are major health threats to employees in office-based occupations. Physical activity is widely used as a stress-management intervention for employees. Moreover, experiences in contact with nature have been shown to provide stress-reduction and restoration from mental fatigue.OBJECTIVES: In a pilot study designed as a randomized controlled trial we investigated the impact of a green-exercise intervention on psychological and physiological indicators of stress in municipality employees.METHODS: Fourteen employees (7 females and 7 males, 49 +/- 8 yrs) volunteered in an exercise-based intervention in workplace either outdoors in a green/nature area or in an indoor exercise-setting. The intervention consisted of an information meeting and two exercise sessions, each including a biking bout and a circuit-strength sequence using elastic rubber bands (45-minutes, at about 55% of HR reserve, overall). Main outcomes were perceived environmental potential for restoration, affective state, blood pressure (BP) and cortisol awakening response (CAR AUC(G) and CAR AUC(I)) and cortisol levels in serum. Measurements were taken at baseline and in concomitance with the exercise sessions. Furthermore, affective state and self-reported physical activity levels were measured over a 10-weeks follow-up period.RESULTS: Compared with the indoor group, the nature group reported higher environmental potential for restoration (p < 0.001) and Positive Affect (p < 0.01), along with improved CAR AUC(I) (p = 0.04) and, marginally, diastolic BP (p = 0.05). The nature group also reported higher ratings of Positive Affect at follow-up (p = 0.02). Differences at post-exercise were not found for any of the other components of affective state, systolic BP, CAR AUC(G) and cortisol levels measured in serum.CONCLUSIONS: Green-exercise at the workplace could be a profitable way to manage stress and induce restoration among employees. Further studies on larger samples are needed in order to improve the generalizability of the results.","Calogiuri, Giovanna; Evensen, Katinka; Weydahl, Andi; Andersson, Kim; Patil, Grete; Ihlebaek, Camilla; Raanaas, Ruth K.",1,10.3233/WOR-152219,242

300,Resident Preferences for Program Director Role in Wellness Management,"Burnout and depression are prevalent among resident physicians, though the supportive role of the program director (PD) is not well defined. To understand the residents' view of the residency program director's role in assessing and promoting resident wellness. A single institution survey of all house staff was conducted in 2017. Rates of burnout and depression were identified via the 2-item Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Patient Health Questionaire-2 (PHQ-2), respectively. Residents then qualified their preferences for various assistance services and for the role of their program directors in assisting them. One-hundred sixty-one of 202 (79.7%) residents completed the survey. The rate of depression was 28%. Rates of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization (2-item MBI) were 44 and 62%, respectively. Only 4% of respondents had used the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) in the prior 12 months. Eighty-two percent of residents were in favor of PDs inquiring about wellness regardless of their job performance and only 1% of residents stated the PD should not inquire about wellness at all. Thirty-three percent of residents reported that they would be likely to contact EAP on their own if they felt unwell. Significantly more residents (62%) reported being more likely to contact EAP if recommended by their PD (33 vs 62%, p < 0.001%). Important perceived barriers to seeking assistance were lack of time (65%), lack of knowledge of how to contact EAP (41%), and concerns about appearing weak (35%). Despite a high prevalence of burnout and depression, residents are unlikely to seek help on their own. Program directors have an important role in assessing and promoting the wellness of their residents. The majority of residents wants their PD to inquire about wellness and may be more likely to seek and receive help if recommended and facilitated by their PD.","Kolarik, RC; O'Neal, RL; Ewing, JA",0,10.1007/s11606-018-4367-0,244
301,Can meaning buffer work pressure? An exploratory study on styles of meaning in life and burnout in firefighters,"Aim: The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships between different dimensions of meaning in life (personal meaning, the presence of meaning, a search for meaning) and burnout among firefighters. In addition, the differences in the level of burnout in firefighters were evaluated within the three of meaning in life. Method: Participants were 189 firefighters randomly recruited from 12 fire stations in southern Poland; they participated in the study voluntarily. The age range was 20-50 years (mean 33.04 years, SD = 7.87). The following questionnaires were used: the Personal Meaning Profile, the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results: Firefighters with higher levels of personal meaning and presence of meaning reported less emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and more personal accomplishment. Most of the personal meaning dimensions also had significant associations with burnout indicators: individuals with detached style had higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization than individuals with presence style and presence and search style. Discussion: Meaning structures are an important salutary factor that enables firefighters to effectively comprehend and interpret their work-related experiences, and thus reduces the likelihood of distress and weariness they experience. Search for meaning has beneficial effects on burnout consequences among firefighters only if it is linked with presence of meaning. Conclusions: Having valuable goals and purpose in life endows individuals with meaningful experiences that form the building blocks of meaning in life that neutralize the processes and effects of burnout.",Krok D.,0,10.12740/APP/62154,245

306,Physical activity and unplanned illness-related work absenteeism: Data from an employee wellness program,"Background Illness-related absenteeism is a major threat to work productivity. Our objective was to assess the relationship between physical activity and unplanned illness-related absenteeism from work. Methods We implemented physical activity program for sedentary non-clinician employees of a tertiary medical center. Financial rewards were available for reaching accelerometermeasured ambulatory physical activity goals over a 24-week period. We categorized participants into three groups based on mean levels of physical activity: low (0 - 74 min/week), medium (75 - 149 min/week) and meeting CDC guidelines (>= 150 min/week). We built a multivariable Poisson regression model to evaluate the relationship between physical activity and rates of unplanned illness-related absenteeism. Results The sample consisted of 292 employees who participated in the program. Their mean age was 38 years (SD 11), 83% were female, and 38% were obese. Over the 24 intervention weeks, participants engaged in a mean of 90 min/week (SD 74) of physical activity and missed a mean of 14 hours of work (SD 38) due to illness. Unplanned absenteeism due to illness was associated with physical activity. As compared to the group meeting CDC guidelines, in multivariable analyses those in the medium physical activity group had a 2.4 (95% CI 1.3 - 4.5) fold higher rate of illness-related absenteeism and those in the lowest physical activity group had a 3.5 ( 95% CI 1.7 - 7.2) fold higher rate of illness-related absenteeism. Discussion Less physical activity was associated with more illness-related absenteeism. Workforce-based interventions to increase physical activity may thus be a promising vehicle to reduce unplanned illness-related absenteeism.","Losina, E; Yang, HY; Deshpande, BR; Katz, JN; Collins, JE",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0176872,249

308,"Mindfulness at Work: Positive Affect, Hope, and Optimism Mediate the Relationship Between Dispositional Mindfulness, Work Engagement, and Well-Being","Mindfulness has been described as a state of awareness characterized by refined attentional skills and a non-evaluative attitude toward internal and external events. Recently, it has been suggested that higher levels of mindfulness may be beneficial in the workplace and first programs aiming to increase mindful awareness in occupational settings have been introduced. The current study underpins these developments with empirical evidence regarding the involved psychological processes, by investigating the relationship between dispositional mindfulness, work engagement, and wellbeing in 299 adults in full-time employment. As hypothesized, the results confirm that self-reported mindfulness predicts work engagement and general well-being. Furthermore, these relationships are mediated by positive job-related affect and psychological capital (hope, optimism, resiliency, and self-efficacy). Investigating mindfulness and psychological capital as multi-faceted concepts by means of structural equation modeling yielded a more precise picture. The ability to step back from automatic, habitual reactions to distress turned out to be the mindfulness facet most central for predicting work engagement and well-being. Furthermore, mindfulness exerts its positive effect on work engagement by increasing positive affect, hope, and optimism, which on their own and in combination enhance work engagement (full mediation). Well-being, on the other hand, is directly influenced by mindfulness, which exerts additional indirect influence via positive affect, hope, and optimism (partial mediation). Although exploratory in nature, the results identify non-reactivity and non-judging as important mindfulness skills in the workplace.","Malinowski, Peter; Lim, Hui Jia",0,10.1007/s12671-015-0388-5,251

This is contradictory to the requirement identified by the German Social Security Code (SGB VII) that interventions constitute the most important method of maintaining and improving employees' health. Reasons for this can be seen in the complexity of the subject and methodological issues concerning scientific standards.

Bench step exercise can be practiced anywhere at any time. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a bench step exercise on work ability by examining cardiovascular risk factors and oxidative stress. Thirteen volunteers working in a warehousing industry comprised the bench step exercise group (n = 7) and the control group (n = 6). The participants in the step exercise group were encouraged to practice the step exercise at home for 16 weeks. The step exercise improved glucose metabolism and antioxidative capacity and increased work ability by reducing absences from work and improving the prognosis of work ability. The improvement in work ability was related to a reduction in oxidative stress. These results suggest that a bench step exercise may improve work ability by reducing cardiovascular risk factors and oxidative stress.

313,Increasing engagement with an occupational digital stress management program through the use of an online facilitated discussion group: Results of a pilot randomised controlled trial,"Introduction Rates of work-related stress, depression and anxiety are high, resulting in reduced work performance and absenteeism. There is evidence that digital mental health interventions delivered in the workplace are an effective way of treating these conditions, but intervention engagement and adherence remain a challenge. Providing guidance can lead to greater engagement and adherence; an online facilitated discussion group may be one way of providing that guidance in a time efficient way. This study compares engagement with a minimally guided digital mental health program (WorkGuru) delivered in the workplace with a discussion group (DG) and without a discussion group (MSG), and with a wait list control (WLC); it was conducted as a pilot phase of a definitive trial. Methods Eighty four individuals with elevated levels of stress from six organisations were recruited to the study and randomised to one of two active conditions (DG or MSG) or a WLC. The program WorkGuru is a CBT based, eight-week stress management intervention that is delivered with minimal guidance from a coach. Data was collected at baseline, postâ€“intervention and at 16-week follow-up via online questionnaires. The primary outcome measure was number of logins. Secondary measures included further engagement measures, and measures of depression, anxiety, stress, comfort and enthusiasm. Quality measures including satisfaction and system usability were also collected. Results A greater number of logins was observed for the DG compared with the MSG; this was a medium between group effect size (d = 0.51; 95% CI: âˆ’ 0.04, 1.05). Small to medium effect size differences were found at T2 in favour of the active conditions compared with the control on the DASS subscales depression, anxiety and stress, and the IWP subscales enthusiasm and comfort. This was largely maintained at T3. Satisfaction with the intervention was high with individuals in the MSG reporting greater satisfaction than individuals in the DG. Conclusions This study shows that access to an online facilitated discussion group increases engagement with a minimally supported occupational digital mental health intervention (as defined by the number of logins), but that this doesn't necessarily result in improved psychological outcomes or increased satisfaction when compared to access to the intervention without the group. Access to the web-based program was associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress and an increase in comfort and enthusiasm post intervention; these changes were largely maintained at follow-up.

The purpose of this pilot study is to explore the effect of an online facilitated discussion group on engagement, and to estimate the potential effectiveness of an online CBT-based stress management programme. Methods: This study is a three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a minimally guided, online, CBT-based stress management intervention delivered with and without an online facilitated bulletin board, and a wait list control group. Up to 90 employees from six UK-based organisations will be recruited to the study. Inclusion criteria will include age 18years or over, elevated levels of stress (as measured on the PSS-10 scale), access to a computer or a tablet and the Internet. The primary outcome measure will be engagement, as defined by the number of logins to the site; secondary outcome measures will include further measures of engagement (the number of pages visited, the number of modules completed and self-report engagement) and measures of effectiveness (psychological distress and subjective wellbeing). Possible moderators will include measures of intervention quality (satisfaction, acceptability, credibility, system usability), time pressure, goal conflict, levels of distress at baseline and job autonomy. Measures will be taken at baseline, 2weeks (credibility and expectancy measures only), 8weeks (completion of intervention) and 16weeks (follow-up). Primary analysis will be conducted on intention-to-treat principles. Discussion: To our knowledge this is the first study to explore the effect of an online discussion group on the engagement and effectiveness of an online CBT-based stress management intervention. This study could provide a solution to the growing problem of poor employee psychological health and begin to address the challenge of increasing engagement with Internet-delivered health interventions.

316,Factors Associated With Long-Term Weight Loss and Weight Maintenance Analysis of a Comprehensive Workplace Wellness Program,"Objective: To examine factors associated with long-term weight loss and maintenance for participants of a comprehensive workplace wellness program. Methods: Data came from Health Risk Assessments completed by 89,746 overweight and obese persons between 2005 and 2010 to examine the association between demographics, improved nutrition, improved exercise and reduced stress and odds of weight loss and weight maintenance, as well as changes in bodyweight at 1 year follow-up. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate coefficients of interest while controlling for confounds. Results: Factors significantly associated with increased odds and amount of weight loss were male gender, older age, reduced psychosocial stress, improved nutrition, and increased exercise when combined with improved nutrition. Conclusions: Comprehensive workplace wellness programs that address weight management through an integrated stress management approach can be effective in addressing the obesity epidemic.","Ovbiosa-Akinbosoye, Osayi E.; Long, D.

317,Tobacco use and preferences for wellness programs among health aides and other employees of an Alaska Native Health Corporation in Western Alaska,"This study assessed health behaviors and preferences for wellness programs among employees of a worksite serving Alaska Native-people. Village-based Community Health Aides/Practitioners (CHA/Ps) were compared with all other employees on health indicators and program preferences. Using a cross-sectional design, all 1290 employees at the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation (YKHC) in Western Alaska were invited in 2015 to participate in a 30-item online survey. Items assessed health behaviors, perceived stress, resiliency, and preferences for wellness topics and program delivery formats. Respondents (nÂ =Â 429) were 77% female and 57% Alaska Natives. CHA/Ps (nÂ =Â 46) were more likely than all other employees (nÂ =Â 383) to currently use tobacco (59% vs. 36%; pÂ =Â 0.003). After adjusting for covariates, greater stress levels were associated (pÂ =Â 0.013) with increased likelihood of tobacco use. Employees reported lower than recommended levels of physical activity; 74% had a Body Mass Index (BMI) indicating overweight or obese. Top preferences for wellness topics were for eating healthy (55%), physical activity (50%), weight loss (49%), reducing stress (49%), and better sleep (41%). CHA/Ps reported greater interest in tobacco cessation than did other employees (37% vs. 21%; pÂ =Â 0.016). Preferred program delivery format among employees was in-person (51%). The findings are important because tailored wellness programs have not been previously evaluated among employees of worksites serving Alaska Native people. Promoting healthy lifestyles among CHAP/s and other YKHC employees could ultimately have downstream effects on the health of Alaska Native patients and communities.

318,Effectiveness of a novel qigong meditative movement practice for impaired health in flight attendants exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke,"This single-arm non-randomized pilot study explores an intervention to improve the health of flight attendants (FA) exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke prior to the smoking ban on commercial airlines. This group exhibits an unusual pattern of long-term pulmonary dysfunction. We report on Phase I of a two-phase clinical trial; the second Phase will be a randomized controlled trial testing digital delivery of the intervention. Subjects were recruited in the Northeastern US; testing and intervention were administered in 4 major cities. The intervention involved 12 h of training in Meditative Movement practices. Based on recent research on the effects of nicotine on fear learning, and the influence of the autonomic nervous system on immune function, our hypothesis was that this training would improve autonomic function and thus benefit a range of health measures. Primary outcomes were the 6-min walk test and blood levels of C-reactive protein. Pulmonary, cardiovascular, autonomic, and affective measures were also taken. Fourteen participants completed the training and post-testing. There was a 53% decrease in high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (p â‰¤ 0.05), a 7% reduction in systolic blood pressure (p â‰¤ 0.05), a 13% increase in the 6-min walk test (p â‰¤ 0.005), and significant positive changes in several other outcomes. These results tend to confirm the hypothesized benefits of MM training for this population, and indicate that autonomic function may be important in the etiology and treatment of their symptoms. No adverse effects were reported.

319,Bus operators' responses to job strain: An experimental test of the job demand-control model,"The research aim was to test the Job Demand-Control (JDC) Model demands Ã— Control interaction (or buffering) hypothesis in a simulated bus driving experiment. The buffering hypothesis was tested using a 2 (low and high demands) Ã— 2 (low and high decision latitude) design with repeated measures on the second factor. A sample of 80 bus operators were randomly assigned to the low (n = 40) and high demands (n = 40) conditions. Demands were manipulated by increasing or reducing the number of stops to pick up passengers, and decision latitude by imposing or removing restrictions on the Rapid Transit Bus (BRT) operators' pace of work. Outcome variables include physiological markers (heart rate [HR], heart rate variability [HRV], breathing rate [BR], electromyography [EMG], and skin conductance [SC]), objective driving performance and self-report measurements of psychological wellbeing (psychological distress, interest/enjoyment [I/E], perceived competence, effort/importance [E/I], and pressure/tension [P/T]). It was found that job decision latitude moderates the effect of job demands on both physiological arousal (BR: F(1, 74) = 4.680, p = .034, SC: F(1, 75) = 6.769, p = .011, and EMG: F(1, 75) = 6.550, p = .013) and psychological well-being (P/T: F(1, 75) = 4.289, p = .042 and I/E: F(1, 74) = 4.548, p = .036). Consistently with the JDC model buffering hypothesis, the experimental findings suggest that increasing job decision latitude can moderate the negative effect of job demands on different psychophysiological outcomes. This finding is useful for designing organizational and clinical interventions in an occupational group at high risk of work stress-related disease.

320,Interventions: Employees' Perceptions of What Reduces Stress,"Objective. To build upon research evaluating stress interventions, this qualitative study tests the framework of the extended Job Demands-Resources model to investigate employees' perceptions of the stress-reduction measures implemented at 13 Australian universities. Methods. In a cross-sectional survey design, tenured and contract staff indicated whether their overall level of stress had changed during the previous three-four years, and, if so, they described the major causes. A total of 462 staff reported that their level of stress had decreased; the study examines commentary from 115 academic and 304 nonacademic staff who provided details of what they perceived to be effective in reducing stress. Results. Thematic analyses show that the key perceived causes were changes in job or work role, new heads of departments or supervisors, and the use of organizational strategies to reduce or manage stress. A higher percentage of academic staff reported reduced stress due to using protective coping strategies or their increased recognition and/or success, whereas a higher percentage of nonacademic staff reported reduced stress due to increases in staffing resources and/or systems. Conclusion. These results identify the importance of implementing multilevel strategies to enhance employees' well-being. Nonacademic staff, in particular, specified a variety of organizational stress-reduction interventions.","Pignata, S; Boyd, CM; Winefield, AH; Provis, C",0,10.1155/2017/3919080,262
321,Awareness of Stress-Reduction Interventions on Work Attitudes: The Impact of Tenure and Staff Group in Australian Universities,"This study explored the impact of staff group role and length of organizational tenure in the relationship between the awareness of stress interventions (termed intervention awareness: IA) and the work-related attitudinal outcomes of university employees. A two-wave longitudinal study of a sample of 869 employees from 13 universities completed a psychosocial work factors and health questionnaire. Hierarchical regression analyses examined the contribution of staff role and different lengths of organizational tenure with IA and employees' reports of job satisfaction, affective organizational commitment, trust in senior management, and perceived procedural justice. Employees' length of tenure affected the relation between IA and work attitudes, and there were also differences between academic and non-academic staff groups. For non-academic employees. IA predicted job satisfaction, affective organizational commitment, trust in senior management, and perceived procedural justice. However, for academics, IA only predicted job satisfaction and trust which identifies a need to increase the visibility of organizational interventions. Across the tenure groups. IA predicted: (1) perceived procedural justice for employees with five or less years of tenure; (2) job satisfaction for employees with 0-19 years of tenure; (3) trust in senior management for employees with 6-19 years of tenure; and (4) affective organizational commitment for employees with a tenure length of 6-10 years. Employees working at the university for an intermediate period had the most positive perceptions of their organization in terms of IA, job satisfaction, trust in senior management, and affective organizational commitment, whereas employees with 20-38 years of tenure had the least positive perceptions. Results suggest that employees in the middle of their careers report the most positive perceptions of their university. The findings highlight the need to attend to contextual issues in organizational stress and wellbeing interventions and suggest that management may need to implement new strategies and/or promote existing stress-management and reduction strategies to academics, and employees whom are either new to the university or those who have been working for the organization for longer periods of time to ensure that they are aware of organizational strategies to promote employee wellbeing and morale within their work environments.","Pignata, S; Winefield, AH; Provis, C; Boyd, CM",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01225,263
326,Using a mixed method audit to inform organizational stress management interventions in sport,"Objectives: The purposes of this study were twofold: to conduct a mixed method organizational-level stress audit within a sport organization and to explore recommendations for organizational stress management. Design and method: Semi-structured interviews, focus groups and surveys were conducted with 47 participants (professional sportsmen, coaches, sport science support and administrative staff) who represented a professional sport organization. Content analysis was employed to analyze the data. Results and conclusions: The findings indicated a wide range of organizational stressors (e.g., cultural and academy issues), appraisals and coping behaviors (e.g., emotion-focused behaviors), and stressor outcomes (e.g., emotional responses) for sport performers. Content analysis and survey data supported the categorization of stress management recommendations at both an individual-(e.g., coping education) and organizational-level (e.g., improving communication channels) for particular target groups (e.g., players, staff, team). The identification of stress audit factors and recommendations have important implications for the optimization of organizational functioning within professional sport. Consistent with organizational psychology research, applied considerations for mixed method and multi-level intervention approaches are discussed.","Rumbold, JL; Fletcher, D; Daniels, K",0,10.1016/j.psychsport.2017.10.010,264
327,Effects of a job crafting intervention program on work engagement among Japanese employees: A pretest-posttest study,"Background: Job crafting, an employee-initiated job design/redesign, has become important for employees' well-being such as work engagement. This study examined the effectiveness of a newly developed job crafting intervention program on work engagement (as primary outcome), as well as job crafting and psychological distress (as secondary outcomes), using a pretest-posttest study design among Japanese employees. Methods: Participants were managers of a private company and a private psychiatric hospital in Japan. The job crafting intervention program consisted of two 120-min sessions with a two-week interval between them. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (Time 1), post-intervention (Time 2), and a one-month follow-up (Time 3). The mixed growth model analyses were conducted using time (Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3) as an indicator of intervention effect. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen's d. Results: The program showed a significant positive effect on work engagement (t = 2.20, p = 0.03) in the mixed growth model analyses, but with only small effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.33 at Time 2 and 0.26 at Time 3). The program also significantly improved job crafting (t = 2.36, p = 0.02: Cohen's d = 0.36 at Time 2 and 0.47 at Time 3) and reduced psychological distress (t = -2.06, p = 0.04: Cohen's d = -0.15 at Time 2 and -0.31 at Time 3). Conclusions: The study indicated that the newly developed job crafting intervention program was effective in increasing work engagement, as well as in improving job crafting and decreasing psychological distress, among Japanese managers.

Methods: The questionnaire-based. cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 at two tertiary level teaching hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan (Ziauddin University Hospital and Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan). The study population comprised 176 residents, General Health Questionnaire-12 was used to assess the mental health of the residents and a standardised Job Satisfaction Survey tool was used to assess their work satisfaction. Results: A total of 176 residents participated in the study; 115 (65%) from Medicine, and 61(35%) from surgery. Of the total residents, 99 (56.3%) were under stress, and there was no significant difference in stress between Medicine and Surgery residents. Besides, 133 (75.6%) residents reported to be satisfied with their jobs. There was a statistically significant difference in job satisfaction between Medicine and Surgery residents (p<0.001). Mean number of working hours per week reported by Medicine and Surgery residents were 74.82 +/- 15.95 and 92.07 +/- 15.91 respectively (p<0.001). A positive correlation of mean working hours with both stress (p=0.009) and job satisfaction (p=0.029) was found. Conclusions: Medicine and Surgery residents tend to differ on mean working hours and job satisfaction. The greater mean working hours of the residents could be a possible reason for increased stress and decreased job satisfaction among the residents.","Sameer-ur-Rehman; Kumar, R; Siddiqui, N; Shahid, Z; Syed, S; Kadir, M",0,,266
329,Effects of stress management program for teachers in Japan: A pilot study,"The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a stress management program for teachers on their stress responses, social support, and coping. Participants (n=24) were assigned to either an intervention or a waiting list control group. A five-session program, including psychoeducation, group discussion, role-playing and relaxation training, was conducted for the intervention group at two week intervals. Eight participants from each of the groups responded to pre- and post-intervention questionnaire surveys. The positive intervention effect was significant for social support from co-workers (p=0.035), whereas the negative intervention effect was significant for proactive coping (p=0.033). No significant effect was observed for stress responses (vigor, anger, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and somatic stress responses) (p>0.05). The positive intervention effect was marginally significant for social support from co-workers (p=0.085) and anger (p=0.057) among those who at first had high stress response scores in the pre-intervention survey (n=5 and n=4 for the intervention and waiting list control groups, respectively). Furthermore, the positive intervention effect was significant for social support from co-workers (p=0.021) and marginally significant for resignation coping (p=0.070) among those who at first had high job control scores (n=4 and n=5 for the intervention and waiting list control groups, respectively). Results showed that the stress management program conducted in this study contributed to increasing social support from co-workers. This study suggests that a program that focuses on a particular subgroup (e.g., those with high stress responses or high job control) might be effective in enhancing coping skills, increasing social support, and reducing stress responses.","Shimazu A., Okada Y., Sakamoto M., Miura M.",0,10.1539/joh.45.202,267
330,"Effects of a brief worksite stress management program on coping skills, psychological distress and physical complaints: A controlled trial","Objectives: To examine the effects of single-session, small-group stress management program on knowledge about stress, coping skills, and psychological and physical distress. Methods: A total of 300 employees from a company in western Japan were invited to participate in the study. Those who consented to enter the study were assigned to an intervention (n = 149) or waiting list control group (n = 151). Participants in the intervention group received a small-group stress management program. The program was primarily aimed at increasing knowledge about stress and improving coping skills. To investigate the intervention effect, change scores in outcome variables were calculated by subtracting the scores at pre-intervention from those at post-intervention (8 weeks after the pre-intervention survey). Next, the difference in the scores between groups was examined using analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with the pre-intervention score as the covariate. Results: Favorable intervention effects were found on knowledge about stress and on coping skills (P<0.001 and P = 0.012, respectively) and adverse effects on psychological distress (P = 0.022). However, this adverse effect on psychological distress did not exist among those who initially perceived higher levels of job control. Conclusion: The single-session stress management program was effective on improving knowledge about stress, and coping skills, where job control moderated the effect of the program on psychological distress.

331,"The evaluation of a continuing professional development package for primary care dentists designed to reduce stress, build resilience and improve clinical decision-making","Introduction Stress and burnout are widely accepted as a problem for primary care dental practitioners. Previous programmes to address this issue have met with some success. Burnout is associated with poor coping skills and emotion regulation, and increased rates of clinical errors. Anxiety is associated with poor decision-making and is thought to be associated with poor clinical decision-making. Attempts to improve decision-making use increasing meta-awareness and review of thinking processes. Bibliotherapy is an effective method of delivering cognitive behavioural therapy as self-help or guided self-help (with some therapist input) formats. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of a specially designed CPD package which was designed to improve coping skills, build resilience and reduce the impact of anxiety on dentists' clinical decision-making. Design A multi-centred quasi-experiment. Setting Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire (England) 2014. Materials and methods Thirty-five volunteer primary care dentists used two versions (self-help [SH] and guided self-help [GSH], which included a 3 hour workshop) of a specially written cognitive behavioural therapy bibliotherapy programme designed to improve well-being and decision-making. Main Outcome Measures The main outcome measures were dentists' burnout, depression, anxiety, stress and decision-making style. Data were also collected on use and evaluation of the programme. Results At 6 weeks there was a clinically and statistically significant reduction in depression, anxiety and stress levels, a statistically significant reduction in burnout (emotional exhaustion) and hypervigilant decision-making, and an increase in personal achievement. The improvements in depression, stress, emotional exhaustion and hypervigilant decision-making were maintained at 6 months. Dentists were overwhelmingly positive in their evaluation of the project and used most of its contents. Conclusion With the caveat of small numbers and the lack of a no-treatment control, this project demonstrated that a self-help package can be highly acceptable to dentists and, in the short-to-medium term, improve dentists' well-being and decision-making with implications for patient safety.","Chapman, H.

333,Improving the sleep of children's hospital employees through an email-based sleep wellness program,"Health care worker sleepiness and fatigue increases the risk of adverse events, compromises patient safety, and increases risk to personal safety and well-being. Addressing sleep problems in large health care institutions through traditional face-To-face interventions can be expensive and difficult to implement to a large employee pool. Little is known about the use of more cost-effective and time-efficient sleep health programs with health care professionals, such as online or email-based sleep interventions. The purpose of this article was to describe the development, implementation, and outcomes of Sleep Smart, an email-based employee sleep wellness program. Sleep Smart was created by a clinical psychologist board certified in behavioral sleep medicine, with consultation and review by an experienced employee wellness coordinator. It consisted of 8 weekly e-mailed modules highlighting different aspects of sleep, paired with online surveys. Participants (employees of a large midwestern tertiary children's hospital and some spouses [n = 1,333]) completed measures including the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at baseline and after completing the program. Results indicate a significant improvement in sleep quality, reduction in insomnia symptoms, decreases in daytime fatigue and reported sleepiness while driving, and a reduction in sleep medication usage. Outcomes from this study support additional exploration of cost-effective technology-based sleep health initiatives aimed at health care professionals. Improving hospital employee sleep could positively affect the delivery of care and patient safety.

335,Effect of an office worksite-based yoga program on heart rate variability: outcomes of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Chronic work-related stress is an independent risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases and associated mortality, particularly when compounded by a sedentary work environment. The purpose of this study was to determine if an office worksite-based hatha yoga program could improve physiological stress, evaluated via heart rate variability (HRV), and associated health-related outcomes in a cohort of office workers.Methods: Thirty-seven adults employed in university-based office positions were randomized upon the completion of baseline testing to an experimental or control group. The experimental group completed a 10-week yoga program prescribed three sessions per week during lunch hour (50 min per session). An experienced instructor led the sessions, which emphasized asanas (postures) and vinyasa (exercises). The primary outcome was the high frequency (HF) power component of HRV. Secondary outcomes included additional HRV parameters, musculoskeletal fitness (i.e. push-up, side-bridge, and sit & reach tests) and psychological indices (i.e. state and trait anxiety, quality of life and job satisfaction).Results: All measures of HRV failed to change in the experimental group versus the control group, except that the experimental group significantly increased LF: HF (p = 0.04) and reduced pNN50 (p = 0.04) versus control, contrary to our hypotheses. Flexibility, evaluated via sit & reach test increased in the experimental group versus the control group (p < 0.001). No other adaptations were noted. Post hoc analysis comparing participants who completed >= 70% of yoga sessions (n = 11) to control (n = 19) yielded the same findings, except that the high adherers also reduced state anxiety (p = 0.02) and RMSSD (p = 0.05), and tended to improve the push-up test (p = 0.07) versus control.Conclusions: A 10-week hatha yoga intervention delivered at the office worksite during lunch hour did not improve HF power or other HRV parameters. However, improvements in flexibility, state anxiety and musculoskeletal fitness were noted with high adherence. Future investigations should incorporate strategies to promote adherence, involve more frequent and longer durations of yoga training, and enrol cohorts who suffer from higher levels of work-related stress.","Cheema, Birinder S.; Houridis, Angelique; Busch, Lisa; Raschke-Cheema, Verena; Melville, Geoff W.; Marshall, Paul W.; Chang, Dennis; Machliss, Bianca; Lonsdale, Chris; Bowman, Julia; Colagiuri, Ben",0,10.1186/1472-6882-13-82,272
336,Effect of an office worksite-based yoga program on heart rate variability: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Chronic work-related stress is a significant and independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and associated mortality, particularly when compounded by a sedentary work environment. Heart rate variability (HRV) provides an estimate of parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic control, and can serve as a marker of physiological stress. Hatha yoga is a physically demanding practice that can help to reduce stress; however, time constraints incurred by work and family life may limit participation. The purpose of the present study is to determine if a 10-week, worksite-based yoga program delivered during lunch hour can improve resting HRV and related physical and psychological parameters in sedentary office workers.Methods and design: This is a parallel-arm RCT that will compare the outcomes of participants assigned to the experimental treatment group (yoga) to those assigned to a no-treatment control group. Participants randomized to the experimental condition will engage in a 10-week yoga program delivered at their place of work. The yoga sessions will be group-based, prescribed three times per week during lunch hour, and will be led by an experienced yoga instructor. The program will involve teaching beginner students safely and progressively over 10 weeks a yoga sequence that incorporates asanas (poses and postures), vinyasa (exercises), pranayama (breathing control) and meditation. The primary outcome of this study is the high frequency (HF) spectral power component of HRV (measured in absolute units; i.e. ms(2)), a measure of parasympathetic autonomic control. Secondary outcomes include additional frequency and time domains of HRV, and measures of physical functioning and psychological health status. Measures will be collected prior to and following the intervention period, and at 6 months follow-up to determine the effect of intervention withdrawal.Discussion: This study will determine the effect of worksite-based yoga practice on HRV and physical and psychological health status. The findings may assist in implementing practical interventions, such as yoga, into the workplace to mitigate stress, enhance health status and reduce the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.","Cheema, Birinder S.; Marshall, Paul W.; Chang, Dennis; Colagiuri, Ben; Machliss, Bianca",1,10.1186/1471-2458-11-578,273

The intervention significantly lowered body weight (intervention vs. reference = -1.22 vs. -0.30kg, p = 0.026), BMI (-0.46 vs. -0.02kg/m2, p = 0.006), and waist circumference (-2.68 vs. +0.79cm, p <0.001), but had no effect on biochemical parameters. These findings suggest the workplace-based health promotion can be effective and useful in reducing the risk of metabolic disorders in older workers in Taiwan.","Chen, S., Westman, M., & Eden, D.

339,"The effectiveness of a new, coping flexibility intervention as compared with a cognitive-behavioural intervention in managing work stress","In typical stress management programmes, working adults acquire various coping skills for managing work stress. In addition to building coping skills, we propose the inclusion of a ""meta skill"" of coping flexibility, which helps individuals to recognize the distinctions among the coping requirements of diverse stressful events and to facilitate employment of appropriate skills for handling the specific demands of those events. Our study tested this proposal by comparing the efficacy of a new coping flexibility intervention with that of a commonly adopted cognitive-behavioural intervention in reducing depression. We randomly assigned 161 healthy Chinese working adults (55 men, 106 women, M age = 32 years) to (1) attend a coping flexibility intervention for acquiring both coping skills and coping flexibility, (2) attend a cognitive-behavioural intervention for acquiring coping skills only, or (3) a waiting list to receive an intervention after the study had been completed. Participants were followed up four months later. Those who had attended the coping flexibility intervention reported the largest increase in levels of coping flexibility, and such an increase corresponded to a reduction in depression immediately and four months after the intervention. These results indicate the value of teaching individuals to adapt their coping strategies to specific requirements of stressful situations.

340,Tensions of Health: Narratives of Employee Wellness Program Participants,"This article examines dialectical tensions in the health narratives of participants of the Employee Wellness Program (EWP) of a large public university in the southeastern United States. Semi-structured interviews (n=12) with team leaders in the program indicated that health is a multifaceted concept characterized by three pairs of dialectical tensions: autonomy versus connection, private versus public, and control versus lack of control. These findings suggest that to better promote health and wellness in the workplace, EWP staff should consider employees' unique experiences and beliefs about health when designing organization-wide programs and campaigns.","Tang, L; Baker, JS; Meadows, CZ",0,10.1177/2165079916643966,277
342,Misfit of organizational and personal work standards and its longitudinal effect on physicians' depressiveness,"The misfit of organizational and personal work standards and its relationship to health is an issue that has rarely been investigated in hospital physicians. In particular, compensatory factors for the negative effects of a misfit of organizational and personal work standards remain unknown. Our longitudinal study investigated whether autonomous experiences at work and during leisure time compensate for the effects of a misfit of organizational and personal work standards on depressive complaints. Data were collected through surveys of German hospital physicians. Two surveys were conducted with a time lag of 12Â months. One hundred sixty-one physicians participated in both surveys. To test our hypothesis, we used path analysis and controlled for autoregressive effects. The results confirmed that a misfit of organizational and personal work standards affects depressive complaints over a 12-month period. Additionally, leisure autonomy compensates for the negative effects of misfit. Contrary to that, high levels of job autonomy were found to intensify the effects of a misfit of organizational and personal work standards. Our findings support previous research assumptions that job autonomy has the potential to add to stress. Hospitals must ensure that physicians can adequately use their job autonomy.

343,"Forgiveness Working: Forgiveness, Health, and Productivity in the Workplace","Purpose: Associations between forgiveness and health promotion in the workplace were examined as mediating effects of workplace interpersonal stress.Design: Cross-sectional.Setting: Multiple Washington, DC, office-based and Midwestern manufacturing workplaces.Participants: Study 1: 108 employees (40 males and 68 females); mean age was 32.4 years. Study 2: 154 employees (14 males and 140 females); mean age was 43.9 years.Measures: Questionnaires measured forgiveness, unproductivity, absenteeism, stress, and health problems.Analysis: Bivariate and multiple correlation/regression and structural equation models were used. Indirect effects were estimated with bootstrapping methods.Results: In study 1, forgiveness of a specific workplace offense was inversely associated with unproductivity (r = -.35, P < .001) and mental (r = -.32, P = .001) and physical (r = -.19, P = .044) health problems. In study 2, trait forgiveness was inversely associated with unproductivity (beta = -.20, P = .016) and mental (beta = -.31, P < .001) and physical health problems (beta = -.28, P = .001), and workplace interpersonal stress partially mediated these associations (indirect effects = -.03, -.04, -.05, respectively).Conclusion: The association of forgiveness and occupational outcomes is robust. Forgiveness may be associated with outcomes by (at least partially) reducing stress related to workplace offenses. Forgiveness may be an effective means of coping following being emotionally hurt on the job that may promote good health, well-being, and productivity.","Toussaint, Loren; Worthington, Everett L., Jr.; Van Tongeren, Daryl R.; Hook, Joshua; Berry, Jack W.; Shivy, Victoria A.; Miller, Andrea J.; Davis, Don E.",0,10.1177/0890117116662312,279
344,Effects of a rational-emotive health education intervention on stress management and irrational beliefs among technical college teachers in Southeast Nigeria,"Background: Stress is the product of how an individual reacts and adapts to the specific demands and threats they encounter while carrying out given tasks. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a rational-emotive health education intervention (REHEI) on stress management, and irrational beliefs in a sample of technical college teachers in Southeast Nigeria. Method: The study design was a pretest-posttest control group. Repeated measures analysis of variance, paired t test and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyze the data collected. Results: The REHEI significantly reduced teacher stress in those teaching staff exposed to the treatment intervention, relative to a waitlist control group. Furthermore, the REHEI program significantly decreased irrational beliefs about teaching in those teaching staff exposed to the treatment intervention compared to a waitlist control group. Conclusion: The REHEI program can be used to coach teachers on how to manage and cope with stress and overcome irrational beliefs in teaching. Â© 2017 the Author(s).

MethodThis study examined staff members' views of stress and the effectiveness of a stress-management intervention. Effectiveness was assessed using written assignments regarding stress management, and changes in views presented were tested in a pre- and post-test control group design. ResultsIn the first phase, a content analysis was conducted across groups, which revealed that participants expressed a broad variety of views about stress and coping mechanisms, with considerable individual differences. In the second phase, a more fine-grained quantitative analysis was conducted to assess training effectiveness. Results showed an increase in the proportion of coping strategies referred to by the experimental group post-training. This positive change remained at follow-up.

We administered a questionnaire to 140 Italian workers, including measures of the predictors (mindfulness, self-compassion, affective commitment) and of job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and burnout components, i.e. emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and diminished personal accomplishment. Results of latent regression analyses showed that mindfulness and self-compassion were associated with work-related well-being indicators, beyond the effects of affective commitment, gender, and years of service. These findings suggest that a training in mindfulness and self-compassion could improve well-being at the workplace in an effective way.","Voci, Alberto; Veneziani, Chiara A.; Bernardi, Silvia",0,10.1482/82881,282

Methods: The study was based on a national survey that randomly sampled 1745 worksites and 17,500 nested employees. The survey asked the work sites whether improvements of the work environment were conducted; and it asked the employees to report the number of work-related stresses they experienced. Multilevel multinominal logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted. Results: Improvement of the work environment was not significantly associated with any level of work-related stress. Among men, it was significantly and negatively associated with the severe level of work related stress. The association was not significant among women. Conclusions: Improvements to work environments may be associated with reduced work-related stress among men nationwide in Japan.","Watanabe, Kazuhiro; Tabuchi, Takahiro; Kawakami, Norito",0,10.1097/JOM.0000000000000950,283
350,A meta-analysis on antecedents and outcomes of detachment from work,"Detachment from work has been proposed as an important non-work experience helping employees to recover from work demands. This meta-analysis (86 publications, k = 91 independent study samples, N = 38,124 employees) examined core antecedents and outcomes of detachment in employee samples. With regard to outcomes, results indicated average positive correlations between detachment and self-reported mental (i.e., less exhaustion, higher life satisfaction, more well-being, better sleep) and physical (i.e., lower physical discomfort) health, state well-being (i.e., less fatigue, higher positive affect, more intensive state of recovery), and task performance (small to medium sized effects). However, average relationships between detachment and physiological stress indicators and work motivation were not significant while associations with contextual performance and creativity were significant, but negative. Concerning work characteristics, as expected, job demands were negatively related and job resources were positively related to detachment (small sized effects). Further, analyses revealed that person characteristics such as negative affectivity/neuroticism (small sized effect) and heavy work investment (medium sized effect) were negatively related to detachment whereas detachment and demographic variables (i.e., age and gender) were not related. Moreover, we found a medium sized average negative relationship between engagement in work-related activities during non-work time and detachment. For most of the examined relationships heterogeneity of effect sizes was moderate to high. We identified study design, samples' gender distribution, and affective valence of work-related thoughts as moderators for some of these aforementioned relationships. The results of this meta-analysis point to detachment as a non-work (recovery) experience that is influenced by work-related and personal characteristics which in turn is relevant for a range of employee outcomes.

351,The Mediating Role of Self-Compassion Between Mindfulness and Compassion Fatigue Among Therapists in Hong Kong,"Compassion fatigue is known to be an occupational strain for therapists, whose work involves facilitating changes among people who are experiencing adversities. Compassion fatigue can dampen therapistsâ€™ quality of life. Using a cross-sectional questionnaire design, the present study tested the mediating role of self-compassion between the relationships of mindfulness with two aspects of compassion fatigue, burnout and secondary traumatic stress, as well as compassion to clients, among a group of therapists. A sample of 77 clinical psychologists and trainees in Hong Kong were invited to complete measures on positive and negative qualities of self-compassion, mindfulness, burnout, secondary traumatic stress, and compassion to clients. Using the bootstrapping multivariate procedure, results showed that the relationships between mindfulness with both burnout and secondary traumatic stress were mediated by self-coldness (i.e., the composite of negative qualities in self-compassion). On the other hand, the relationship between mindfulness with compassion to clients was mediated by self-warmth (i.e., the composite of positive qualities in self-compassion). The present study showed that mindfulness may confer psychological benefits on therapists in preventing burnout and secondary traumatic stress. It also showed outcome-specific mediating effects of self-coldness and self-warmth in a group of therapists that varied in self-reported levels of mindfulness.

352,"National Student Conference of the Canadian Society for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Saskatoon, Canada, May 13-14, 2012 Abstracts","Prenatal alcohol exposure is the leading cause of intellectual disability in the Western world. Due to the organic brain damage caused by alcohol, and the resulting cognitive, functional, and behavioural deficits, people with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) are at high risk for becoming involved in the legal system, either as offenders or as victims, if appropriate diagnosis, interventions and support services are not initiated early in life and maintained throughout the life-course. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of incarceration for youths (1218 years) with FASD, compared to youths without FASD, in Canada. Using the epidemiological data available on the prevalence of incarceration in youths with FASD and data on the prevalence of incarceration in youths without FASD in the general population of Canada, it was estimated that youths with FASD are nineteen times more likely to be imprisoned than youths without FASD, on any given day in a specific year. These alarming study findings emphasize the need to incorporate screening for FASD as early as possible in the criminal justice process. It is crucial to better understand the mental disabilities of offenders prenatally exposed to alcohol and make appropriate referrals for mental health and other services.Vitamin D is a nutritional factor hypothesized to mitigate and prevent hypertensive diseases of pregnancy due to its effect on placental immunomodulation, vascularisation, and blood pressure regulation. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of high-dose prenatal vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure during the third trimester of pregnancy. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving 160 pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy was conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh (2010-2011). Participantswere randomized to receive either vitamin D3 (35,000 IU/week) or placebo until delivery. Blood pressure was measured at five timepoints and vitamin D status was assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration. Generalized estimating equations were applied to longitudinally compare the change in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure over time between the two groups. Participants in the vitamin D-supplemented group had statistically insignificant lower rates of increase in SBP (-3.2 [-9.0, 2.8] mmHg) and DBP (-2.4 [-7.8, 3.1] mmHg) compared to women in the placebo group during follow-up. In conclusion, this trial of vitamin D supplementation in pregnant Bangladeshi women did not demonstrate a significant effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure during the third trimester of pregnancy.Unipolar major depression is one of the top ten contributors to global disease burden. Young people transitioning into college and university are particularly at risk of developing symptoms of stress and depression. The purpose of this research was to identify the major risk factors and correlates of depression and stress among Canadian and American undergraduate students. The search was conducted in the Ovid (Medline) database, using MeSH terms for disease terms (mental health, mental disorders, depression, depressive disorders, and stress (psychological)); risk terms (risk factors, indicators, and determinants; and hedge terms (university, post-secondary, and students). Inclusion criteria were country of origin (U.S. and Canada) and English language, and exclusion criteria were articles older than 15 years. The final search included eight articles from which data was collected.Identified risk factors and correlates of stress and depression were of behavioural nature or social or demographic nature. Positive risk factors/correlates for depression were marijuana use, social problem solving deficits, race [Black/Hispanic/multi-ethnic], smoking, and emotional abuse. Inverse risk factors/correlates for depression/stress were religiosity/spirituality, social problem solving abilities, vigorous physical activity, and social support. Statistically significant relationships between positive and negative risk factors and correlates, and stress/depression are identified in this review.Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are flame retardants with widespread exposure. Although PBDEs are known thyroid toxicants in animal studies, human studies are sparse, especially during pregnancy and infancy when thyroid hormones are critical for early brain development. This study will examine associations between PBDE levels in maternal serum (at 15 weeks gestation), and thyroid hormones (free T4, total T4 and TSH) in both maternal serum (n 152), collected in 2007-2008 at 15 and 18 weeks gestation) and umbilical cord serum (n 116), using data from the Chemicals, Health and Pregnancy (CHirP) Study based in Vancouver, Canada. Median PBDE concentrations (ng/g lipid) were 9.1, 1.6, 1.9 and 3.2 for BDE 47, BDE 99, BDE 100 and BDE 153, respectively, and were similar to those in the Canadian population. Final results are forthcoming, as this is a proposed Masters thesis. However, PBDEs are hypothesized to be positively associated with free T4, and negatively associated with TSH - similar to previous studies of women later in pregnancy. This study will provide some of the first evidence about the thyroid disrupting potential of PBDEs during the most critical window of thyroid-mediated fetal brain development, and provide important missing information for ongoing risk assessments.The Maternal Mental Health Program (MMHP) in Saskatoon, Canada was developed to: 1) improve access to and quality of mental health care for preconceptual, pregnant, and postpartum women and 2) promote collaboration between a specialist mental health team and physicians using a shared care model of service delivery. The study evaluated the effects of the MMHP on anxiety and depression symptoms, the determinants of these symptoms, and participants and physicians satisfaction with the MMHP, using established questionnaires and Likert-style surveys. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were performed. Participants included 99 women who completed the MMHP between 2006 and 2011 and 98 physicians who delivered care to childbearing women. There was a significant reduction in anxiety and depression symptoms among participants. Symptoms were associated with the social determinants of health. The majority of women (n 75, 75.8) and physicians (n 75, 93.7) were satisfied with the MMHP, in particular with: 1) accessibility, 2) comfort and skill level in treating maternal mental health patients, and 3) support from and competency of the staff. The MMHP exemplifies a shared care model in practice; however, to improve the mental health of women overall, the social determinants of health must also be addressed.Massage therapists (MTs) are increasingly becoming important providers of health and wellness care. Conducted in Saskatchewan, Canada in 20092010 the study aimed to determine if massage therapists held positive or negative attitudes toward research and to explore the association between attributes of providers and reported use of research.The study was conducted in two phases using a sequential explanatory mixed methods design. In phase one, a mail-out survey was sent to all 815 members of the Massage Therapist Association of Saskatchewan (MTAS). In phase two, interviews with six members further explored their attitudes toward research. Survey data was analyzed using SPSS. Univariate and logistic regression analysis was conducted. Qualitative data was explored using thematic content analysis. Forty-one percent of the questionnaires were completed and returned. Survey results revealed that most study participants held positive attitudes toward research. The factors most strongly associated with self-reported research use included a positive attitude toward research-based practice and searching research databases. While case study participants attitudes toward research were largely positive they described experiencing some frustration with accessing and understanding research. Greater emphasis on research literacy training in pre-service and continuing education is necessary to support massage therapists in using research their work.Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) is used in breast reconstruction surgery to increase implant expansion and improve capsular reinforcement. The objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the risk of postoperative complications in patients using ADM in implant-based reconstruction. Electronic databases and health technology assessment reports were searched. Meta-analysis was performed of the risk ratios of complications reported in studies that compared ADM to conventional reconstruction. There were 27 cohort studies and one systematic review eligible for inclusion published since 2005. The pooled risk of any complication with ADM was 20.8 (95 confidence interval [CI] 15.3, 27.7). The meta-analysis of nine comparative studies showed that ADM use was associated with a higher risk of implant loss (risk ratio [RR] 3.98; 95 CI 1.96, 8.11) infection without implant removal (RR 2.49; 95 CI 1.4, 14.37) and seroma (RR 2.72; 95 CI 1.75, 4.23), and lower risk of capsular contracture (RR 0.3; 95 CI 0.09, 0.998), compared to conventional reconstruction. The evidence suggests that there is a higher risk of certain types of complications with ADM use compared to non-ADM use. Further research is needed to assess the aesthetic outcomes of breast reconstruction surgeries using ADM.Social network patterns influence risk behaviors for HIV and other infectious diseases. This study hypothesizes that condom use is related to the closeness of participants to social network members, length of time known and multiple roles. Using respondent driven sampling, social network data were collected from underhoused people, sex workers, people who use drugs, and street youth (n 226) from Ottawa, Canada in 2010. Social network members who provided support but engaged in risky drug/sex behavior were defined as onegative support.' Stratified by recruitment tree, condom behavior and social network relationship associations were tested by (2). 31.0 of participants were female, 86.6 were Caucasian, 54.9 had less than high school education, and 73.0 were sexually active in the last 6 months. The mean age was 41.4 years (SD 10.6). A greater likelihood of using condoms was significantly associated with a lower proportion of negative support social network members known for greater than one year (P 0.04) and modestly associated with the absence of a negative support social network member with multiple roles (P 0.08).Future work will determine whether these variables are independent predictors of condom use. Studying the quality of relationships strengthens interventions that mobilize social support for health protection.This paper uses data from Smart Cities Healthy Kids (www.smartcitieshealthykids.ca), an ongoing mixed methods, population health intervention study which aims to understand the influence of neighborhood built environment on childrens physical activity. Neighborhoods of Saskatoon were categorized into 3 development eras based on their urban form and vintage. Built environment data were collected using replicable observation tools. A questionnaire was administered to children to capture their perception of factors that influence their physical activity. In the summer of 2010, for one continuous week, Actical accelerometers were used to measure physical activity of 455 children aged 10-14 years. Moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was derived from accelerometer data and used as the outcome variable. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 19 and HLM 7. Robust differences were observed in MVPA accumulation with high values during school days and low values during weekend days. Based on this pattern, MVPA was categorized into school days and weekend days, and multilevel models were fitted for each category. Determinants of MVPA varied between school days and weekend days. Density of destinations, which was previously reported to improve the likelihood of physical activity in adults, was detrimental in children, suggesting a differential built environment impact.Prevalence of childhood obesity and overweight has increased two- to three-fold within a generation in Canada and in the United States; this has attracted serious public health concern. The study examined the impact of neighborhood design and specific built environment factors on active transportation to school among children 1014 years in the city of Saskatoon, Canada. Neighborhood Active Living Potential tool and the Irvine-Minnesota Inventory were used to determine the built environment factors within a range of neighborhood designs, from grid pattern, mixed grid to curvilinear pattern. A self-reported questionnaire collected data from 1610 children on modes of transport to school and other places, and a range of active transportation determinants. Multilevel logistic regression analysis estimated adjusted associations. The children are more likely to report that they walk or bike to school, if they are: boys, from higher SES families, older, and have more siblings. In addition, children from neighborhoods with high-density, grid-pattern road network are more likely to report active transportation; the further the neighborhoods from the grid-pattern core, the less likely were the children to engage in active transportation. Safety has a significant influence on the use of active transportation. There is a need for tailored policy intervention to improve safety and childrens activity friendly neighborhoods.The live-birth prevalence of Down syndrome (DS) has either declined or stabilized in many countries, despite the increase in the average age of mothers. Studies have linked lower DS live birth rates to the introduction and expansion of prenatal screening programs, however little is known about its impact in Canada. A population-based, prospective, cohort was compiled drawing from regional and provincial databases, and included all pregnancies to Saskatchewan residents from 20002005.To assess the impact of ToPFCA on live birth DS rates, the authors calculated annual rates that included and excluded DS-affected pregnancies terminated following prenatal screening/diagnosis. Of cases diagnosed during pregnancy, 73 of Down Syndrome cases were terminated (12.6 of all DS cases). The birth prevalence and birth incidence rates increasingly diverged from 11.7 and 11.7 per 10,000 births in 2000 respectively; 12.5 and 13.2 in 2001; 14.6 and 15.4 in 2002; 14.4 and 16.8 in 2003; 15.2 and 18.4 in 2004; 14.4 and 17.7 in 2005. The average annual percent increase was 3.8 for the live birth trend line over the 6-year period and 7.4 for the incidence line. Study results provide evidence that the practice of ToPFCA lowered the annual DS live birth rate from 2001 and forward. The greatest impediment to basic CA surveillance in Canada is the national surveillance systems in ability to capture ToPFCA, which prevents systematic investigation of risk factors and trends in maternal, perinatal, and infant health.Asthma is a common chronic condition in children. Vitamin D provides immunity against infections resulting in decreased asthma exacerbation. The objective of the study was to determine the association of vitamin D level with current wheeze and lung function parameters. The Canadian Health Measures Survey is a cross-national survey conducted by Statistics Canada in 20072009. The presence of current wheeze was determined from the questionnaire. Serum vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D [nmol/L]) level was categorized into 49, 5074 (moderate), and epsilon 75. Logistic and linear regression incorporating survey design and bootstrap weights were used. In total 1,213 children (males 52.5; females 47.4) of ages 6 to 12 years participated in the study. Prevalence of current wheeze was 11.4, 4.1, and 7.1 among lower, moderate, and higher vitamin D categories, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders both the lower and higher categories were associated with current wheeze compared to moderate category (OR: 3.26; 95 CI: 1.169.17 and OR: 2.14; 95 CI: 1.074.28, respectively). Lung function parameters varied significantly between vitamin D levels with the highest mean values observed in the moderate category. Optimal respiratory outcomes observed in moderate vitamin D level suggest that monitoring vitamin D level should be considered in children.",[Anonymous],0,,286

354,Stress in caregivers of individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities: A systematic review of mindfulness-based interventions,"Background: The efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for stress and psychological distress in professional caregivers supporting individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities (IDDs) is reviewed. Methods: Eight studies met inclusion criteria and were systematically reviewed, including RCTs and single-group designs. Results: As per Reichow, Volkmar, and Cicchetti (Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 38, 2008), three studies were classified as â€œadequate qualityâ€ and five were classified as â€œweak.â€ There were inconsistent findings in relation to stress, with significant reductions or increases reported by caregivers following MBIs. MBIs consistently improved caregiversâ€™ ratings of distress. Process outcomes suggested increased mindful awareness, increased cognitive defusion and reduced thought suppression. Treatment effects were maintained or continued to grow at follow-up. Conclusions: Caregivers of individuals with IDDs face multiple challenges on a daily basis. This review supports, at least, short-term benefits for MBIs in the management of stress and distress in caregivers of individuals with IDDs.

355,Physical fitness levels do not affect stress levels in a sample of Norwegian adolescents,"Physical inactivity, low physical fitness, and perceived stress during adolescence are presumed to be risk factors for various disorders and subjective health complaints. On the other hand, physical activity and physical fitness, as well as mindfulness qualities, are regarded as prerequisites for health and well-being in children and adolescent, possibly by moderating the negative effects of stress and protecting against stress-related health complaints. Previous studies have suggested gender differences in the relationship between physical activity/physical fitness and psychological variables. The main objective in this study was to evaluate how physical fitness, along with mindfulness qualities (MAAS-A), pain, and BMI, relate to stress (PSQ) in adolescents. Secondary objectives were to explore the relationship between physical fitness, mindfulness (MAAS-A), and BMI more explicitly in the study sample, as well as to evaluate possible gender differences. The cross-sectional sample included 102 Norwegian pupils in 10th grade (15 or 16 years). Study measurements were four items from the Test of Physical Fitness (TPF), the Norwegian version of the four-factor Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), the Norwegian version of the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent (MAAS-A), and BMI (recorded in terms of self-reported height and weight). Additionally, pain was measured in terms of localization, number of pain sites, duration, and intensity (Visual analogue scale; VAS). According to the regression analyses, physical fitness could not explain any variation in stress among the adolescents. Nevertheless, there were some negative associations between one stress factor (lack of joy) and components of physical fitness at a group level, possibly influenced by conditions not measured in this study. As opposed to physical fitness, mindfulness qualities, and to some degree gender, seemed to explain variation in stress among the adolescents. None of the physical fitness components were associated to mindfulness (MAAS-A), but some components seemed negatively related to BMI, particularly among the males. Among the females, higher physical fitness (in terms of endurance) seemed related to reduced number of pain sites. Of note, the cross-sectional design did not allow us to determine any causal direction among the variables.

The aims of this study were to assess prevalence of stress among the resident trainees of the three medical specialties of Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCHS) training programs, namely, Internal Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, and their association with training years, sex, and marital status. This study also aimed to correlate the stress levels with the working efficiency and self-perceived general health problems. Participants and methods: Resident trainee physicians of SCHS were invited to complete a stress inventory Kessler 10, which is used for stress measurement. Pearson's chi-square test (chi(2)) and odds ratios (ORs) were used to quantify the associations between categorical variables. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 318 (out of 389, with the response rate of 82%) resident trainees participated in this study. The mean (+/- standard deviation) age of the study population was 27.9 (+/- 1.6) years. The results showed 70.4% of resident trainees had stressful conditions, which consisted of severe stress: 22.6%, moderate stress: 20.4%, and mild stress: 27.4%. During the 1st year (R-1), moderate stress (OR = 5.87; 95% confidence interval = 2.93-17.79; P=0.001) and severe stress (OR = 11.15; 95% confidence interval = 4.35-28.51; P=0.0001) levels were quite high. The highest stress level was found in Emergency Medicine (80.5%), followed by Internal Medicine (73.6%), and Family Medicine (63.2%) (chi(2)=6.42; P=0.04). The stress level decreased with the increase of years of training in Emergency Medicine (chi(2)=23.76; P<0.0001) and Internal Medicine (chi(2)=60.12; P<0.0001), whereas increased in Family Medicine (chi(2)=11.80; P=0.008). High stress level was significantly associated with absence from duty days (chi(2)=28.48, P<0.0001), inefficient day activities (chi(2)=39.15; P<0.0001), and general health problems (chi(2)=45.27; P<0.0001) of resident trainees. Conclusion: We found significantly high levels of stress among the resident trainees of SCHS. High levels of stress may have an effect on their working efficiency and general physical health. The high stress level decreased efficient day activity and made the trainees absent from the workplace.","Abdulghani, HM; Al-Harbi, MM; Irshad, M",0,10.2147/NDT.S92408,290
358,The effectiveness of Group Movie Therapy (GMT) on parental stress reduction in mothers of children with mild mental retardation in Tehran,"30 volunteer mothers of children with mild mental retardation were selected through convenient sampling and randomly assigned into control and experimental groups. Parental stress was assessed by using the PSI at pre-post, and one month follow up. Subjects of Group Movie Therapy (GMT) received10 weekly sessions comprised of watching the movie ""M, like mother"" and then engaging in group discussion over common experiences related to the movie. Mixed ANOVA showed GMT significantly decreased the intensity of parental stress in experimental subjects. The effectiveness of group movie therapy method seems to be afforded through facilitating cognitive, emotive and behavioral modeling. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

359,Web-Delivered CBT Reduces Heavy Drinking in OEF-OIF Veterans in Primary Care With Symptomatic Substance Use and PTSD,"Veterans from conflicts such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan commonly return with behavioral health problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and hazardous or harmful substance use. Unfortunately, many veterans experience significant barriers to receiving evidence-based treatment, including poor treatment motivation, concerns about stigma, and lack of access to appropriate care. To address this need, the current study developed and evaluated a web-based self-management intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), targeting PTSD symptoms and hazardous substance use in a group of symptomatic combat veterans enrolled in VA primary care. Veterans with PTSD/subthreshold PTSD and hazardous substance use were randomized to primary care treatment as usual (TAU; n = 81) or to TAU plus a web-based CBT intervention called Thinking Forward (n = 81). Thinking Forward consisted of 24 sections (approximately 20 minutes each), accessible over 12 weeks. Participants completed baseline and 4-, 8-, 12-, 16-, and 24-week follow-up assessments. Three primary outcomes of PTSD, alcohol and other drug use, and quality of life were examined. Significant treatment effects were found for heavy drinking, but not for PTSD or quality of life. The effect of the intervention on heavy drinking was mediated by intervening increases in coping, social support, self-efficacy, and hope for the future. These results demonstrate the promise of a web-based, self-management intervention for difficult-to-engage OEF/OIF veterans with behavioral health and substance use concerns.

361,The cognitive management of daily life activities in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease in a day care centre: A case report,"The day care centre appears to be a structure especially well suited for the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer patients. It constitutes a place in which performance in everyday life activities can be explored, and optimisation strategies can be installed before they are used at home. Another objective of the day care centre might also be to provide caregivers with support and ease the burden that the daily care of a demented patient represents. Finally, it may also help to alleviate the patient's loneliness. In this perspective, we describe the general organisation of the recently-created day care centre at the University Hospital of Liege. We also present the assessment and intervention programme which was conducted in this day care centre in order to reduce the generalised apathy and depressed mood observed in a 70-year-old Alzheimer patient (AM). This programme aimed at restoring a leisure activity (knitting) at home by proposing several adaptations designed to minimise the impact of AM's cognitive deficits on knitting activity. While an aggravation of her memory deficits was observed, the intervention significantly decreased AM's apathy and depressed mood as well as her husband's burden.","Adam S., Van der Linden M., Juillerat A.-C., Salmon E.",0,10.1080/09602010050143568,293
362,"Testing a Moderated Mediation Model of Mindfulness, Psychosocial Stress, and Alcohol Use Among African American Smokers","Mindfulness-based strategies have received empirical support for improving coping with stress and reducing alcohol use. The present study presents a moderated mediation model to explain how mindfulness might promote healthier drinking patterns. This model posits that mindfulness reduces perceived stress, leading to less alcohol use, and also weakens the linkage between stress and alcohol use. African American smokers (N = 399, 51Â % female, Mage = 42) completed measures of dispositional mindfulness, perceived stress, quantity of alcohol use, frequency of binge drinking, and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Participants with higher levels of dispositional mindfulness reported less psychosocial stress and lower alcohol use on all measures. Furthermore, mindfulness moderated the relationship between perceived stress and quantity of alcohol consumption. Specifically, higher perceived stress was associated with increased alcohol use among participants low, but not high, in mindfulness. Mindfulness may be one strategy to reduce perceived stress and associated alcohol use among African American smokers.

363,Effect of transition home from combat on risk-taking and health-related behaviors,"Transition home following a combat deployment involves a period of adjustment. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of a new 16-item transition scale were conducted with 2 samples and resulted in 4 factors (Benefit, Appreciation, Anger/Alienation, and Guilt/Remorse). In Study 1 (N = 1,651), the number of combat events was positively related to Anger/Alienation 4 months later even after controlling for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, partial r = .18, p < .001. In Study 2 (N = 647), after controlling for PTSD symptoms, Anger/Alienation assessed at 4 months postdeployment predicted more risk-taking behaviors 4 months later, partial r = .10, p = .01. Appreciation predicted fewer unhealthy habits, partial r = -.13, p = .001, whereas Anger/Alienation predicted more unhealthy habits, partial r = .09, p = .024. Results demonstrate the importance of broadening the conceptualization of adjustment in combat veterans.

Aims: We give an overview of the program and of the development of its Hungarian version, and we present our experiences related to its cultural adaptation and widespread implementation. Methods: We worked out and culturally adapted the Hungarian version of the WLS in 2004, and we are continuously developing it. Besides the WLS workshops, we launched a train the trainer program (Facilitator training), and we provide continuous supervision to the facilitators. The self-management version of the WLS (70' DVD and Workbook) was prepared in 2007. We have adapted the program for teens, teachers, and for emotional eaters. The program is accredited for health care workers and teachers. We studied the effectiveness of the small group workshops based on questionnaires. Results: The applicability of the WLS in everyday practice is well confirmed by the fact that until now up to 4000 people attended the WLS workshops country wide. The WLS facilitator training was completed by over 200 professionals that allows the implementation of the program in all regions of Hungary. The efficacy of the WLS workshops has been confirmed by our 6-month follow-up survey. The coping skills improved, the levels of perceived stress, depression and anxiety, and the subjective somatic symptoms decreased. By some minimal supplements the program was successfully adapted for some specific target groups. Conclusions: The experiences over the past ten years with the Williams LifeSkillsÂ® small group psychosocial skills training program confirmed that the Hungarian version can be implemented in a wide range of settings. The subjective evaluation and satisfaction of the participants in accordance with the results of international and domestic studies demon-strated the efficacy of the program.

366,Assessment of cognitive behavioral therapy on quality of life of patients with chronic war-related post-traumatic stress disorder,"Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the one of the most commonly observed psychiatric disorder in veterans. The condition can lead to considerable social, occupational, and interpersonal dysfunction. PTSD occurring after combat injury appears to be strongly correlated with the extent of injury, and develops over several months. Present study was designed for assessing the cognitive behavioral therapy in the quality of life (QOL) of war-related PTSD in veterans compared to control group and compare applied treatments with each other. Materials and Methods: In the present study, we assessment effects of cognitive behavioral therapy such as problem solving, exposure therapy and their combination on QOL in 120 Iranian PTSD patients veterans after Iran-Iraq war. They were randomly allocated to one of four equal interventional groups: (a) Problem solving therapy (b) exposure therapy (c) combined therapy (exposure therapy plus problem solving) (d) control group. Before and after study intervention, patients were evaluated by short form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. Results: Post-test and follow-up SF-36 scores were 55.6Â±4 and 55.1Â±3.6 in exposure therapy, 50Â±4.4 and 56.1Â±3.8 in problem solving, and 48.73Â±3.8 and 50.9Â±4.2 in combined therapy. In comparing to control group, all intervention showed significant improvement in QOL in PTSD patients. Conclusion: According to the results of the present study, behavioral therapy can improve QOL in PTSD patients.","Ahmadizadeh M., Ahmadi K., Anisi J., Ahmadi A.B.",0,10.4103/0253-7176.122222,297
367,Common mental disorders and subsequent work disability: A population-based Health 2000 Study,"Background: Work disability due to common mental disorders has increased in Western countries during the past decade. The contribution of depressive, anxiety, and alcohol use disorders to all disability pensions at the population level is not known. Methods: Epidemiological health data from the Finnish Health 2000 Study, gathered in 2000-2001, was linked to the national register on disability pensions granted due to the ICD-10 diagnoses up to December 2007. Mental health at baseline was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Sociodemographic, clinical, and work-related factors, health behaviors, and treatment setting were used as covariates in the logistic regression analyses among the 3164 participants aged 30-58 years. Results: Anxiety, depressive, and comorbid common mental disorders predicted disability pension when adjusted for sex and age. In the fully adjusted multivariate model, comorbid common mental disorders, as well as physical illnesses, age over 45 years, short education, high job strain, and previous long-term sickness absence predicted disability pension. Limitations: The study population included persons aged 30 or over. Sub groups according to mental disorders were quite small which may have diminished statistical power in some sub groups. Baseline predictors were measured only once and the length of exposure could not be determined. The systems regarding financial compensation to employees differ between countries. Conclusions: Comorbid mental disorders pose a high risk for disability pension. Other independent predictors of work disability include socio-demographic, clinical, work-related, and treatment factors, but not health behavior. More attention should be paid to work-related factors in order to prevent chronic work disability. Â© 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The article describes the culturally and historically important link between heart and mind. It then describes depression and anxiety, both as manifestations of heart disease and as contributors to the disease prognosis. In addition to discussing risk factors, the article discusses factors that protect against the co-occurrence of mental health problems and heart disease such as positive attitudes, coping mechanisms, social supports, and spirituality. Further, the article highlights issues concerning the clinical assessment of mental health symptoms and interventions to address them. Finally, it summarizes the collaborative chronic care model, in which health care professionals-including medical, mental health, gerontological, and community social workers-assess and manage patients with comorbid mental health symptoms and heart disease.","Ai, Amy L.; Rollman, Bruce L.; Berger, Candyce S.",0,10.1093/hsw/35.1.27,299

It was hypothesized that, in a sample of 808 treatment-seeking individuals (M<inf>age</inf>=35.11, SD=14.94), the best-fitting confirmatory factor analysis model of AS and DT would comprise a common underlying affect sensitivity factor orthogonal to DT and lower-order AS factors (physical, cognitive, and social concerns). It was also hypothesized that specific relations between the factors and fear, distress, and alcohol/substance use disorders would emerge. The best-fitting model comprised a common affect sensitivity factor orthogonal to DT and lower-order AS factors. Whereas the affect sensitivity and DT factors were associated with fear, distress, and alcohol/substance use disorders, AS cognitive concerns was only related to distress disorders and AS social concerns was only related to fear disorders.

We propose a research agenda based on gaps noted in our research review and empirical and theoretical evidence of issues relevant to but not studied directly in MST populations. We present evidence that MST is qualitatively distinct from other forms of sexual maltreatment in terms of its relational and vocational context as well as the severity of associated psychological distress, examine underexplored gender and sexual issues in MST, and discuss the lack of treatment and prevention studies specific to MST.

371,A psychology of the human brainâ€“gutâ€“microbiome axis,"In recent years, we have seen increasing research within neuroscience and biopsychology on the interactions between the brain, the gastrointestinal tract, the bacteria within the gastrointestinal tract, and the bidirectional relationship between these systems: the brainâ€“gutâ€“microbiome axis. Although research has demonstrated that the gut microbiota can impact upon cognition and a variety of stress-related behaviours, including those relevant to anxiety and depression, we still do not know how this occurs. A deeper understanding of how psychological development as well as social and cultural factors impact upon the brainâ€“gutâ€“microbiome axis will contextualise the role of the axis in humans and inform psychological interventions that improve health within the brainâ€“gutâ€“microbiome axis. Interventions ostensibly aimed at ameliorating disorders in one part of the brainâ€“gutâ€“microbiome axis (e.g., psychotherapy for depression) may nonetheless impact upon other parts of the axis (e.g., microbiome composition and function), and functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome represent a disorder of the axis, rather than an isolated problem either of psychology or of gastrointestinal function. The discipline of psychology needs to be cognisant of these interactions and can help to inform the future research agenda in this emerging field of research. In this review, we outline the role psychology has to play in understanding the brainâ€“gutâ€“microbiome axis, with a focus on human psychology and the use of research in laboratory animals to model human psychology.

372,Can Senior Volunteers Deliver Reminiscence and Creative Activity Interventions? Results of the Legacy Intervention Family Enactment Randomized Controlled Trial,"Context. Palliative care patients and their family caregivers may have a foreshortened perspective of the time left to live, or the expectation of the patient's death in the near future. Patients and caregivers may report distress in physical, psychological, or existential/spiritual realms.Objectives. To conduct a randomized controlled trial examining the effectiveness of retired senior volunteers (RSVs) in delivering a reminiscence and creative activity intervention aimed at alleviating palliative care patient and caregiver distress.Methods. Of the 45 dyads that completed baseline assessments, 28 completed postintervention and 24 completed follow-up assessments. The intervention group received three home visits by RSVs; control group families received three supportive telephone calls by the research staff. Measures included symptom assessment and associated burden, depression, religiousness/spirituality, and meaning in life.Results. Patients in the intervention group reported a significantly greater reduction in frequency of emotional symptoms (P = 0.02) and emotional symptom bother (P = 0.04) than the control group, as well as improved spiritual functioning. Family caregivers in the intervention group were more likely than control caregivers to endorse items on the Meaning of Life Scale (P = 0.02). Only improvement in intervention patients' emotional symptom bother maintained at follow-up after discontinuing RSV contact (P = 0.024).Conclusion. Delivery of the intervention by RSVs had a positive impact on palliative care patients' emotional symptoms and burden and caregivers' meaning in life. Meaningful prolonged engagement with palliative care patients and caregivers, possibly through alternative modes of treatment delivery such as continued RSV contact, may be necessary for maintenance of therapeutic effects.

374,Time to question diabetes self-management support for Arabic-speaking migrants: exploring a new model of care,"Aim The objective of this study was to explore a new model for diabetes self-management support in Arabic-speaking migrants.Methods Two qualitative methods were used: face-to-face semi-structured individual interviews and focus groups. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and coded thematically. Arabic-speaking migrants with Type 2 diabetes were recruited from several primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare settings in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. These settings were purposefully selected to obtain a diverse group of participants. Data collection continued until saturation was reached. This is the first study that involved members of Arabic-speaking communities in Australia in a formal process of consumer and public involvement to inform research design and recruitment in order to provide evidence for a new model of diabetes self-management for Arabic-speaking migrants.Results No self-management support was offered to Arabic-speaking migrants beyond the initial diagnosis period. Significant knowledge gaps and skills deficits in all self-management domains were evident. The provision of tailored self-management support was considered crucial. When asked about preferred structure and delivery modalities, a strong preference was reported for face-to-face storytelling interactions over telephone-or internet-based interventions. Gender-specific group education and self-management support sessions delivered by Arabic-speaking diabetes health professionals, lay peers or social workers trained in diabetes self-management were highly regarded.Conclusions A patient and public involvement approach allows genuine engagement with Arabic-speaking migrants with diabetes. There is urgent need for a new model for self-management support among Arabic-speaking migrants. Findings yielded new recommendations for diabetes health professionals working with these migrant communities to support behaviour change.","Alzubaidi, H.; Mc Namara, K.; Browning, C.",0,10.1111/dme.13286,304
376,Compression therapy for occupational leg symptoms and chronic venous disorders - A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials,"Objective. Leg discomfort and oedema are commonly attributed to a venous disorder (CVD) or chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and treated with compression hosiery. The pressure needed to achieve clinical benefit is a matter of debate.Design. We performed a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCT) that compared stockings exerting an ankle pressure of 10-20 mmHg with placebo or no treatment and with stockings exerting a pressure of more than 20 mmHg.Methods. RCT were retrieved and analysed with the tools of the Cochrane Collaboration. Each study was reviewed independently. Subjective dichotomous and continuous factors and objective findings were pooled for statistical treatment.Results. Eleven RCT fulfilled the predefined criteria. They included 1453 randomised subjects, 794 healthy people exposed to various forms of stress, 552 patients with a chronic venous disorder or chronic venous insufficiency and 141 patients after varicose vein surgery. Over all, compression with 10-20 mmHg had a clear effect on oedema and symptoms as compared with <10 mmHg pressure, placebo stockings, or no treatment (p < .0001). No study showed a difference between 10-20 and >20 mmHg stockings.Conclusions. Despite important methodological heterogeneity and sometimes sub-standard reporting the meta-analysis suggests that leg compression with 10-15 mmHg is an effective treatment for CVD. Less pressure is ineffective and higher pressure may be of no additional benefit. (C) 2007 European Society for Vascular Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We developed an intervention (foster family intervention [FFI]) to tackle these risks. The intervention focuses on foster children below the age of 5 years. The objective was to investigate the effects of FFI on the interactions between foster parents and foster children. A randomized control trial was carried out with a sample of 123 preschool aged children (mean age 18.8 months; 51% boys) and their foster carers. A pretest was carried out 6 to 8 weeks after placement and a posttest one half year later. Interactions were videotaped and coded using the Emotional Availability Scales (EAS). Foster carers were asked to fill in the Dutch version of the Parenting Stress Index. Morning and evening samples of children's salivary cortisol were taken. In the posttest, significantly positive effects were found on the following EAS subscales: Sensitivity, Structuring, Nonintrusiveness, and Responsiveness. We found no significant differences on stress levels of foster carers and children (Nijmeegse Ouderlijke Stress Index domains and salivary cortisol). This study shows that the FFI has a significant positive effect on parenting skills as measured with EAS and on Responsiveness of the foster child. Findings are discussed in terms of impact and significance relating to methodology and design of the study and to clinical relevance.

The Ways of Coping Inventory was administered to all participants at three different stages: pre-treatment, posttreatment, and at 6-month follow-up. The results indicated that both the didactic stress management group and the group counselling for stress management group showed a significant reduction in the use of helpless coping strategies and a significant increase in the optimistic coping strategies at post-treatment. At follow-up, there were obvious group differences in the use of helpless coping strategies. Only those who were treated using group counselling exhibited a decrease in helpless coping strategies at the follow-up assessment.","Coban A.E., Hamamci Z.",1,10.1375/ajgc.19.1.71,307

The aim of our study was to explore family caregivers' experiences from their perspective as they cared for dying relatives. Method: Using the Photovoice methodology, ten unpaid family caregivers took photographs depicting issues they experienced as informal caregivers of an ill family member who had less than a year to live. Each participant met with the first author individually four to six times and explained their role as caregiver through photographs and stories. Results: The results were clustered into seven themes: physical demands, emotional/spiritual stress, preparing for the future, securing help, medication management, navigating the agencies, and relationships. Significance of results: Caregivers perform a variety of tasks, often under stress. This study highlights the main areas where problems lie and the areas that palliative care health professionals need to be aware of so they can assist and educate caregivers, with the goal of finding solutions to the burdens of care. The themes were found to be intertwined, showing the complexity of the caregiving role. Copyright Â© Cambridge University Press 2014.","Angelo J., Egan R.",0,10.1017/S1478951514000522,308

Seventy-three men were randomized to either a group-based CBSM intervention (n = 47) or a wait-list control (WLC) condition (n = 26). Men assigned to CBSM showed significantly lower posttreatment levels of self-reported anxiety, anger, total mood disturbance, and perceived stress and less norepinephrine (NE) output as compared with men in the WLC group. At the individual level, anxiety decreases paralleled NE reductions. Significantly greater numbers of T- cytotoxic/suppressor (CD3+CD8+) lymphocytes were found 6 to 12 months later in those assigned to CBSM. Moreover, greater decreases in NE output and a greater frequency of relaxation home practice during the 10-week CBSM intervention period predicted higher CD3+CD8+ cell counts at follow-up.","Antoni M.H., Cruess D.G., Cruess S., Lutgendorf S., Kumar M., Ironson G., Klimas N., Fletcher M.A., Schneiderman N.",0,10.1037//0022-006X.68.1.31,309

Symptoms such as intrusive thoughts may be ameliorated during this period with a structured, group-based cognitive behavior intervention. Method: A 10-week group cognitive behavior stress management intervention that included anxiety reduction (relaxation training), cognitive restructuring, and coping skills training was tested among 199 women newly treated for stage 0-III breast cancer. They were then followed for 1 year after recruitment. Results: The intervention reduced reports of thought intrusion, interviewer ratings of anxiety, and emotional distress across 1 year significantly more than was seen with the control condition. The beneficial effects were maintained well past the completion of adjuvant therapy. Conclusions: Structured, group-based cognitive behavior stress management may ameliorate cancer-related anxiety during active medical treatment for breast cancer and for 1 year following treatment. Group-based cognitive behavior stress management is a clinically useful adjunct to offer to women treated for breast cancer.","Antoni M.H., Wimberly S.R., Lechner S.C., Kazi A., Sifre T., Urcuyo K.R., Phillips K., Smith R.G., Petronis V.M., Guellati S., Wells K.A., Blomberg B., Carver C.S.",0,10.1176/appi.ajp.163.10.1791,310
387,Increases in a marker of immune system reconstitution are predated by decreases in 24-h urinary cortisol output and depressed mood during a 10-week stress management intervention in symptomatic HIV-infected men,"Background: Stress management interventions reduce distress symptoms and hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hormones such as cortisol, which has been related to a down-regulation of immune system components relevant to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We previously showed that HIV+ men assigned to a 10-week cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention showed more CD4+CD45RA+CD29+ lymphocytes, an indicator of immune system reconstitution, at a 6- to 12-month follow-up compared with controls. Here, we tested whether reductions in urinary cortisol output and depressed mood during the 10-week CBSM intervention period mediated its effects on this immune system reconstitution marker at follow-up. Methods: Twenty-five HIV-infected men randomized to either a 10-week CBSM intervention or a wait-list control provided 24-h urine samples and psychological responses pre- to postintervention, which were related to changes in immune status over a 6- to 12-month follow-up period. Results: Greater reductions in cortisol output and depressed mood during CBSM appeared to mediate the effects of this intervention on this indicator of immune system reconstitution over the 6- to 12-month follow-up period. Changes in mood were maintained over the follow-up period, although these did not add explanatory information beyond the cortisol and mood changes that were observed during the 10-week intervention period. These findings were not explained by the changes in medications or health behaviors during follow-up. Conclusion: A time-limited CBSM intervention may affect the rate of immune system reconstitution in HIV-infected men by modifying the stress of symptomatic disease. This intervention may work by decreasing depressed mood and normalizing HPA axis functioning. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

388,Cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention decreases the prevalence of depression and enhances benefit finding among women under treatment for early-stage breast cancer,"The authors tested effects of a 10-week group cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention among 100 women newly treated for Stage 0-II breast cancer. The intervention reduced prevalence of moderate depression (which remained relatively stable in the control condition) but did not affect other measures of emotional distress. The intervention also increased participants' reports that having breast cancer had made positive contributions to their lives, and it increased generalized optimism. Both remained significantly elevated at a 3-month follow-up of the intervention. Further analysis revealed that the intervention had its greatest impact on these 2 variables among women who were lowest in optimism at baseline. Discussion centers on the importance of examining positive responses to traumatic events-growth, appreciation of life, shift in priorities, and positive affect-as well as negative responses.","Antoni, MH; Lehman, JM; Kilbourn, KM; Boyers, AE; Culver, JL; Alferi, SM; Yount, SE; McGregor, BA; Arena, PL; Harris, SD; Price, AA; Carver, CS",0,10.1037/0278-6133.20.1.20,312
389,Safety at Work in Cold Environments and Prevention of Cold Stress,"The questions related to safety at work in cold environments and prevention of cold stress in working life are described in this article. Working in the cold environment is more dangerous than the same type of work in a warmer climate. All researchers have concluded that the frequency of accidents/versus temperature curves follow the U-shape with the minimum near 20 degrees C. The effects of low temperature can be divided into direct, typically frostbites, and indirect, of which the indirect effects, typically slipping accidents, are more common. In improving risk management in cold conditions the risk evaluation based on existing standards is the starting point. Prevention of risks in cold environments can be done by planning of work, technical measures like heating or reduction of cooling by protective clothing, training and other measures. Local heaters, shelters against bad weather, reduction of draught are good examples of means of improving working conditions and reducing accident risks. The local IR-heaters can increase skin temperature of ringers about 7 degrees C in normal cold work. The improvement of 3 degrees C can be reached by using insulating material in the handle of tools. By using these technical improvements we can reduce the health risks but also improve work performance and even energy savings at work places.","Anttonen, H; Pekkarinen, A; Niskanen, J",0,10.2486/indhealth.47.254,313
390,Managing temptation in obesity treatment: A neurobehavioral model of intervention strategies,"Weight loss outcomes in lifestyle interventions for obesity are primarily a function of sustained adherence to a reduced-energy diet, and most lapses in diet adherence are precipitated by temptation from palatable food. The high nonresponse and relapse rates of lifestyle interventions suggest that current temptation management approaches may be insufficient for most participants. In this conceptual review, we discuss three neurobehavioral processes (attentional bias, temporal discounting, and the cold-hot empathy gap) that emerge during temptation and contribute to lapses in diet adherence. Characterizing the neurobehavioral profile of temptation highlights an important distinction between temptation resistance strategies aimed at overcoming temptation while it is experienced, and temptation prevention strategies that seek to avoid or minimize exposure to tempting stimuli. Many temptation resistance and temptation prevention strategies heavily rely on executive functions mediated by prefrontal systems that are prone to disruption by common occurrences such as stress, insufficient sleep, and even exposure to tempting stimuli. In contrast, commitment strategies are a set of devices that enable individuals to manage temptation by constraining their future choices, without placing heavy demands on executive functions. These concepts are synthesized in a conceptual model that categorizes temptation management approaches based on their intended effects on reward processing and degree of reliance on executive functions. We conclude by discussing the implications of our model for strengthening temptation management approaches in future lifestyle interventions, tailoring these approaches based on key individual difference variables, and suggesting high-priority topics for future research.

391,Therapeutic alliance in telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy for hematopoietic stem cell transplant survivors,"Objective: A strong therapeutic alliance has been found to predict psychotherapeutic treatment success across a variety of therapeutic modalities and patient populations. However, only a few studies have examined therapeutic alliance as a predictor of psychotherapy outcome among cancer survivors, and none have examined this relation in telephone-administered cognitive-behavioral therapy (T-CBT). This study evaluated the extent to which therapeutic alliance affected psychotherapy outcomes in survivors of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), a treatment for some cancers. Method: Forty-six patients enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of T-CBT for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) completed a baseline assessment (including self-report measures of PTSD symptoms, depression, and general distress), 10 individual T-CBT sessions, and follow-up assessments at 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline. Therapeutic alliance was assessed after the 3rd T-CBT session with the Working Alliance Inventory, which yields overall and subscale (task, bond, and goal) scores. Results: Analyses revealed that higher total therapeutic alliance scores prospectively predicted decreased depressive symptomatology; higher task scores predicted decreased overall distress, depressive symptomatology, symptoms of re-experiencing, and avoidance; and higher bond scores predicted decreased depressive symptomatology and symptoms of re-experiencing. Conclusions: These results suggest that assessments of therapeutic alliance should be incorporated into routine clinical care, and therapeutic alliance should be specifically cultivated in interventions to maximize psychotherapeutic benefits involving vulnerable populations such as cancer survivors.

393,Review of the Evidence that Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment will be a Safe and Effective Therapeutic Against Alzheimer's Disease,"We have demonstrated in multiple studies that daily, long-term electromagnetic field (EMF) treatment in the ultra-high frequency range not only protects Alzheimer's disease (AD) transgenic mice from cognitive impairment, but also reverses such impairment in aged AD mice. Moreover, these beneficial cognitive effects appear to be through direct actions on the AD process. Based on a large array of pre-clinical data, we have initiated a pilot clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of EMF treatment to mild-moderate AD subjects. Since it is important to establish the safety of this new neuromodulatory approach, the main purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive assessment of evidence supporting the safety of EMFs, particularly through transcranial electromagnetic treatment (TEMT). In addition to our own pre-clinical studies, a rich variety of both animal and cell culture studies performed by others have underscored the anticipated safety of TEMT in clinical AD trials. Moreover, numerous clinical studies have determined that short- or long-term human exposure to EMFs similar to those to be provided clinically by TEMT do not have deleterious effects on general health, cognitive function, or a variety of physiologic measures-to the contrary, beneficial effects on brain function/activity have been reported. Importantly, such EMF exposure has not been shown to increase the risk of any type of cancer in human epidemiologic studies, as well as animal and cell culture studies. In view of all the above, clinical trials of safety/efficacy with TEMT to AD subjects are clearly warranted and now in progress. Â© 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

394,Transcranial electromagnetic treatment against Alzheimer's disease: Why it has the potential to trump Alzheimer's disease drug development,"The universal failure of pharmacologic interventions against Alzheimer's disease (AD) appears largely due to their inability to get into neurons and the fact that most have a single mechanism-of-action. A non-invasive, neuromodulatory approach against AD has consequently emerged: transcranial electromagnetic treatment (TEMT). In AD transgenic mice, long-term TEMT prevents and reverses both cognitive impairment and brain amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) deposition, while TEMT even improves cognitive performance in normal mice. Three disease-modifying and inter-related mechanisms of TEMT action have been identified in the brain: 1) anti-AÎ² aggregation, both intraneuronally and extracellularly; 2) mitochondrial enhancement; and 3) increased neuronal activity. Long-term TEMT appears safe in that it does not impact brain temperature or oxidative stress levels, nor does it induce any abnormal histologic/anatomic changes in the brain or peripheral tissues. Future TEMT development in both AD mice and normal mice should involve head-only treatment to discover the most efficacious set of parameters for achieving faster and even greater cognitive benefit. Given the already extensive animal work completed, translational development of TEMT could occur relatively quickly to ""proof of concept"" AD clinical trials. TEMT's mechanisms of action provide extraordinary therapeutic potential against other neurologic disorders/injuries, such as Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and stroke.

395,Gender differences in the factor structure of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in war-exposed adolescents,"DSM-IV's three-factor model of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is rarely empirically supported, whereas other four-factor models (King et al., 1998; Simms, Watson, & Doebbeling, 2002) have proven to be better representations of PTSD's latent structure. To date, a clear consensus as to which model provides the best representation of PTSD's underlying dimensions has yet to be reached. The current study investigated whether gender is associated with factor structure differences using the King et al. (1998) model of reexperiencing, avoidance, numbing, and hyperarousal PTSD symptoms. Participants were war-exposed Bosnian secondary/high school boys and girls (N = 1572) assessed nearly two years after the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. Confirmatory factor analytic tests of measurement invariance across PTSD model parameters revealed many significant sex-linked differences.

396,Assessing the factor structure of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in war-exposed youths with and without Criterion A2 endorsement,"Posttraumatic stress disorder's (PTSD) tripartite factor structure proposed by the DSM-IV is rarely empirically supported. Other four-factor models (King et al., 1998; Simms et al., 2002) have proven to better account for PTSD's latent structure; however, results regarding model superiority are conflicting. The current study assessed whether endorsement of PTSD's Criterion A2 would impact on the factorial invariance of the King et al. (1998) model. Participants were 1572 war-exposed Bosnian secondary students who were assessed two years following the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. The sample was grouped by those endorsing both parts of the DSM-IV Criterion A (A2 Group) and those endorsing only A1 (Non-A2 Group). The factorial invariance of the King et al. (1998) model was not supported between the A2 vs. Non-A2 Groups; rather, the groups significantly differed on all model parameters. The impact of removing A2 on the factor structure of King et al. (1998) PTSD model is discussed in light of the proposed removal of Criterion A2 for the DSM-V.

397,"A randomized, controlled trial of nurse home visiting to vulnerable families with newborns","Objective: This project aimed to evaluate the impact of a home visiting programme that targeted families where the child, for environmental reasons, was at great risk of poor health and developmental outcomes.Methodology: Women in the immediate postpartum period were recruited to a randomized double-blind controlled trial on the basis of self-reported vulnerability factors and were randomly assigned to receive either a structured programme of nurse home visiting, supported by a social worker and paediatrician (n = 90), or assigned to a comparison group receiving standard community child health services (n = 91). Parenting stress and maternal depression were measured at enrolment and at 6 weeks. Preventive health behaviour, service satisfaction and home environment outcomes were tested at 6 weeks, as were child health outcomes.Results: At six weeks, women receiving the home-based programme had significant reductions in postnatal depression screening scores as well as improvements in their experience of the parental role and improvement in the ability to maintain their own identity. Maternal-infant interactions were more likely to be positive, with significantly higher (better) scores in aspects of the home environment related to optimal development in children, particularly maternal-infant secure attachment. intervention group mothers were significantly more satisfied with the community child health service.Conclusions: This form of intervention for families is effective in promoting secure maternal-infant attachment, preventing maternal mood disorder and is welcomed by the families receiving it. These findings may predict long-term benefits for the healthy development of children otherwise at risk of a range of poor health and development outcomes.","Armstrong, KL; Fraser, JA; Dadds, MR; Morris, J",0,10.1046/j.1440-1754.1999.00348.x,321

Stably- and unstably-housed adults living with HIV were assessed for over 25 months. At baseline, unstably-housed adults living with HIV had a more recent HIV diagnosis, higher viral loads, worse physical and mental health, lower rates of antiretroviral therapy use and insurance coverage, and higher rates of hard drug use than stably-housed adults living with HIV. At follow-up, the health of both groups was similar, but unstably-housed adults living with HIV reported significantly more hard drug use and mental health symptoms when compared to the stably-housed adults living with HIV.

400,Cost-utility analysis of individual psychosocial support interventions for breast cancer patients in a randomized controlled study,"Objectives The aim was to explore the cost-utility in providing complementary individual psychosocial support to breast cancer patients compared with standard care (SC). Methods Patients just starting adjuvant therapy (n = 168) at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, were consecutively included and randomized into three groups: psychosocial support from a specially trained nurse (INS), from a psychologist (IPS), or SC. Psychological effects and healthcare utilization were monitored during a 2-year period. The hospital billing system provided cost estimates. Quality-Adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using health-related quality of life data from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C-30) translated into the Euro Quality of Life- 5-Dimensional classification. On the basis of the medical cost offset, a cost-utility analysis was performed. Results Health care utilization was mainly related to the breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. The intervention costs amounted to about â‚¬500 or 3% of the total costs. Total health care costs, including interventions cost, were lower in the INS (â‚¬18,670) and IPS (â‚¬20,419) groups than in the SC group (â‚¬25,800). The number of QALYs were also higher in the INS (1.52 QALY) and IPS (1.59 QALY) groups, compared with the SC group (1.43 QALY). Conclusions The cost-utility analysis revealed that, during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, the individual psychosocial support interventions provided here was cost effective because the health care costs were lower and QALYs were higher compared to SC alone.

401,Burnout and psychiatric morbility among physicians engaged in end-to-life care for cancer patients: A cross-sectional nationwide survey in Japan,"Purpose: To determine the prevalence of burnout and psychiatric morbidity among physicians engaged in end-of-life care for cancer patients in Japan and to explore associated factors related to end-of-life care. Methods: Questionnaires were mailed to 1436 Japanese clinical oncologists and palliative care physicians with a request to complete the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and to report on individual factors, including confidence in patient care. High levels of burnout and psychiatric morbidity were identified using cut-off scores of the MBI and GHQ-12. Results: A total of 697 physicians returned the questionnaires (response rate, 49.6%). Twenty-two percent of the respondents had a high level of emotional exhaustion, 11% had a high level of depersonalization, 62% had a low level of personal accomplishment, and 20% had psychiatric morbidity. Clinical oncologists showed a significantly higher psychiatric morbidity than palliative care physicians. Confidence in having sufficient time to communicate with patients was significantly associated with all the burnout subscales. Conclusions: A low level of personal accomplishment was relatively high among Japanese physicians compared with previous studies. Insufficient confidence in the psychological care of patients was associated with physician burnout rather than involvement in end-of-life care.

First, we describe the core characteristics of chronic pain and its co-occurrence with the anxiety disorders. Second, we review data on the prevalence of co-occurrence. Third, we describe the mutual maintenance and shared vulnerability models, both of which have been offered to explain the co-occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain and may have applicability to various other anxiety disorders. Fourth, we provide an integrative review of available research addressing the postulates of these models specific to the mechanisms of anxiety sensitivity, selective attention to threat, and reduced threshold for alarm. We conclude with general recommendations for improving assessment and treatment of patients who present with an anxiety disorder accompanied by clinically significant pain. Given that most of the available evidence has come from studies of PTSD and chronic pain, we provide a detailed agenda for future investigation of the co-occurrence of chronic pain and other anxiety disorders.

Although these programs have typically been delivered through combinations of seminars and print materials, workplace health promotion programs are increasingly being delivered through the Internet.Objective: The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of a Web-based multimedia health promotion program for the workplace, designed to improve dietary practices, reduce stress, and increase physical activity.Methods: Using a randomized controlled trial design with pretest-posttest comparisons within each group, 419 employees of a human resources company were randomly assigned to the Web-based condition or to a condition that provided print materials on the same topics. All subjects were assessed at pretest and posttest through an online questionnaire containing multiple measures of health behavior and attitudes. The test period was 3 months. Questionnaire data were analyzed mainly by analysis of covariance and t tests.Results: Retention rates were good for both groups - 85% for the Web-based group and 87% for the print group. Subjects using the Web-based program performed significantly better than the print group on Attitudes Toward a Healthful Diet (F(1,415)=7.104, P=.008) and Dietary Stage of Change (F(1,408)=6.487, P=.01), but there were no significant group differences on the five other dietary measures. Both groups also showed improvement from pretest to posttest on most dietary measures, as indicated by significant t tests. Within the Web-based group, dosage analyses showed significant effects of the number of times the subject accessed the program on measures of Dietary Sell-Efficacy (F(2,203)=5.270, P=.003), Attitudes Toward a Healthful Diet (F(2,204)=2.585, P =.045), and Dietary Stage of Change (F(2,200)=4.627, P=.005). No significant differences were found between the two groups on measures of stress or physical activity, although t tests of pretest-posttest changes indicated that both groups improved on several of these measures. The Web-based group gave significantly higher ratings to the program materials than the print group on all health topics and in their overall evaluation (F(1,410)=9.808, P=.002).Conclusions: The Web-based program was more effective than print materials in producing improvements in the areas of diet and nutrition but was not more effective in reducing stress or increasing physical activity. The higher ratings given to the Web-based program suggest that workers preferred it to the print materials. Both groups showed numerous pretest-posttest improvements in all health topics, although such improvements might be attributable in part to a Hawthorne effect. Results suggest that a multimedia Web-based program can be a promising means of delivering health promotion material to the workforce, particularly in the area of diet and nutrition.","Cook, Royer F.; Billings, Douglas W.; Hersch, Rebekah K.; Back, Anita S.; Hendrickson, April",1,10.2196/jmir.9.2.e17,326

Using the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) classification system for preventive interventions of mental disorders (universal, selective, and indicated), we describe individual and small group early interventions and review the effectiveness of these strategies. Specifically, psychological debriefing, psychological first aid, and psychoeducation have been used as selective interventions targeting individuals exposed to trauma with varying degrees of success. However, there is strong empirical support for using cognitive behavioral therapy as an indicated preventive intervention to help symptomatic individuals in the weeks or months following traumatic exposure. A review of the literature also suggests that future research should explore different modes of delivery and devote more attention to determining the best time to intervene after traumatic exposure.

The results revealed that 55% of women were regularly active. Logistic regression models indicated that positive affect was associated with increased and negative affect was associated with decreased overall and leisure activity. Older, married, and employed women were more likely to engage in household/ occupational activity, whereas women who perceived their risk for breast cancer as high were less likely. More educated women and those with higher perceived risk were more likely to engage in leisure activity, and married women were less likely. These results suggest a need to increase activity levels in women at moderate risk for breast cancer, provide variables upon which interventions can be tailored to promote activity, and point to psychological benefits of activity in this population.","Audrain J., Schwartz M., Herrera J., Goldman P., Bush A.",0,10.1023/A:1012943411367,329

Studies from our and other research teams challenge the ""bad reputation"" of emotion-focused coping by demonstrating that items measuring emotion-focused strategies in published coping questionnaires are confounded with distress and self-deprecation. We have developed and validated new instruments to assess coping though acknowledging, understanding, and expressing emotion, that is, coping through emotional approach. Longitudinal and experimental studies using these new scales have documented the adaptive potential of emotional-approach coping in the context of several types of Stressors, including infertility, breast cancer, and chronic pain. However, characteristics of the environmental context, stressful experience, and individual are important moderators of the relations of emotional-approach coping and health-related outcomes. Potential mediators and moderators of coping through emotional approach, clinical relevance of the construct, and directions for research are discussed.","Austenfeld J.L., Stanton A.L.",0,10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00299.x,330
418,Influence of scapular position on the pressure pain threshold of the upper trapezius muscle region,"A position of scapula depression will maintain the upper trapezius muscle region in a lengthened position, causing excessive strain. This strain could lead to peripheral nociceptive nerves sensitization in the affected area, changing the pressure pain threshold (PPT). Thus, people with a faulty alignment of scapular depression may have lower PPT levels in the upper trapezius region when compared to subjects with normal vertical scapular position. The purpose of this double-blind study was to assess the influence of scapular position on the PPT of the upper trapezius region in a young healthy population. Fifty two physical therapy students of the Catholic University of Minas Gerais - PUC-Minas, Brazil, with normal shoulder (NS group, n = 26, 6 men and 20 women) or depressed shoulder (DS group, n = 26, 6 men and 20 women) volunteered to participate in this study. An electronic pressure algometer was used to measure the PPT on the upper trapezius muscle region. The results showed a significant difference between groups, with the DS group (19.0 Â± 9.0 N/cm2) demonstrated lower mean PPT values when compared to NS group (26.1 Â± 9.6 N/cm2) (p < 0.01). Our results showed that healthy young subjects with depressed scapula position had significant lower upper trapezius PPT values when compared to subjects with normal scapula position.

419,Communication skills training in the management of patient aggression and violence in healthcare,"Challenging behaviours may sabotage therapeutic relationships if not addressed appropriately. While medication, environmental planning and staffing resources are requisites for the management of challenging behaviour, effective communication is an important aspect in the management of these challenging behaviours including aggression. Good communication helps the patient become an active partner in the process. Staff training that focuses on communication skills can be useful to both patients and healthcare workers. This paper aims to review the research evidence from existing communication skills training programmes that are exclusively or partly focused on the reduction of aggression perpetrated by patients. This review included one randomized controlled trial protocol, one quasi experimental study, six pre-test/post-test designs, three mixed methods, four qualitative studies, one descriptive survey and four with other designs that were mostly conducted in mental health settings. The findings show that communication skills training improve the confidence of staff in dealing with aggression. However, minimal number of studies with a focus on aggression reduction, the quality of the studies in terms of design and lack of active controlled trials minimizes the generalizability of the findings.

420,Adjustment disorder: A diagnosis whose time has come,"Background Adjustment disorder is among the most frequently diagnosed mental disorders in clinical practice although it has received little academic attention and been the subject of substantial criticism over the past decades. While those suffering with adjustment disorders are often treated by mental health professionals, research interest in the origin of the disorder or the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic and medical interventions has only recently begun to emerge. This article summarizes the empirical literature published on adjustment disorder and points out current diagnostic developments in DSM-5 and ICD-11. Methods Literature for this review was identified through established online search tools, including publications in English, German, and Spanish. Results This paper reviews literature on the evolution of adjustment disorder, and highlights the current state of research with regard to genesis and treatment. Importantly, for the first time ICD-11 intends to define adjustment disorder by explicit symptom groups, unlike DSM-5. Limitations Publications without an English abstract were not included. Conclusions Key directions for future research include investigating the concordance of the ICD-11 and DSM-5 concepts and the effect that the diverging conceptualizations may have. Risk and protective factors specific to AD should be identified and the biological underpinnings of the disorder should be explored. Finally, given the high prevalence of AD in certain clinical settings effective disorder-specific interventions should be developed and evaluated.

421,Effect of Attention Training on Attention Bias Variability and PTSD Symptoms: Randomized Controlled Trials in Israeli and US Combat Veterans,"Objective: Attention allocation to threat is perturbed in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with some studies indicating excess attention to threat and others indicating fluctuations between threat vigilance and threat avoidance. The authors tested the efficacy of two alternative computerized protocols, attention bias modification and attention control training, for rectifying threat attendance patterns and reducing PTSD symptoms.Method: Two randomized controlled trials compared the efficacy of attention bias modification and attention control training for PTSD: one in Israel Defense Forces veterans and one in U.S. military veterans. Both utilized variants of the dot-probe task, with attention bias modification designed to shift attention away from threat and attention control training balancing attention allocation between threat and neutral stimuli. PTSD symptoms, attention bias, and attention bias variability were measured before and after treatment.Results: Both studies indicated significant symptom improvement after treatment, favoring attention control training. Additionally, both studies found that attention control training, but not attention bias modification, significantly reduced attention bias variability. Finally, a combined analysis of the two samples suggested that reductions in attention bias variability partially mediated improvement in PTSD symptoms.Conclusions: Attention control training may address aberrant fluctuations in attention allocation in PTSD, thereby reducing PTSD symptoms. Further study of treatment efficacy and its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms is warranted.","Badura-Brack, Amy S.; Naim, Reut; Ryan, Tara J.; Levy, Ofir; Abend, Rany; Khanna, Maya M.; McDermott, Timothy J.; Pine, Daniel S.; Bar-Haim, Yair",0,10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.14121578,334
422,Post-traumatic stress disorder: emerging concepts of pharmacotherapy,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can result from a traumatic experience that elicits emotions of fear, helpless or horror. Most individuals remain asymptomatic or symptoms quickly resolve, but in a minority intrusive imagery and nightmares, emotional numbing and avoidance, and hyperarousal persist for decades. PTSD is associated with psychiatric and medical co-morbidities, increased risk for suicide, and with poor social and occupational functioning. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are common treatments. Whereas, research supports the efficacy of the cognitive behavioral psychotherapies, there is insufficient evidence to unequivocally support the efficacy of any specific pharmacotherapy. Proven effective pharmacologic agents are sorely needed to treat core and targeted PTSD symptoms, and for prevention. This review describes current and emerging pharmacotherapies that advance these goals.","Baker, Dewleen G.; Nievergelt, Caroline M.; Risbrough, Victoria B.",0,10.1517/14728210902972494,335
424,Developing a European research network to address unmet needs in anxiety disorders,"Anxiety disorders are common, typically have an early onset, run a chronic or relapsing course, cause substantial personal distress, impair social and occupational function, reduce quality of life, and impose a substantial economic burden: they are often comorbid with major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance misuse and physical illness, and are associated with increased risks of suicidal behaviour. As such, anxiety disorders should be regarded as a significant public health problem. However the causes of anxiety disorders remain largely unknown, which hinders accurate diagnosis, the prediction of prognosis, and the development of refined treatment approaches. In clinical practice, many patients with anxiety disorders do not present or are not recognised, the standard of care they receive is often sub-optimal, and the effectiveness of pharmacological and psychological treatment interventions in real-world clinical practice can be disappointing. The current substantial unmet public health, clinical and research needs in anxiety disorders could be addressed in part by developing independent collaborative European networks.

425,The association between changes in pressure pain sensitivity and changes in cardiovascular physiological factors associated with persistent stress,"Objectives. To evaluate the possible association between pressure pain sensitivity of the chest bone (PPS) and cardiovascular physiological factors related to persistent stress in connection with a three-month PPS-guided stress-reducing experimental intervention programme. Methods. Forty-two office workers with an elevated PPS (> 60 arbitrary units) as a sign of increased level of persistent stress, completed a single-blinded cluster randomized controlled trial. The active treatment was a PPS (self-measurement)-guided stress management programme. Primary endpoints: Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and work of the heart measured as Pressure-Rate-Product (PRP); Secondary endpoints: Other features of the metabolic syndrome. Results. PPS decreased and changes in PPS after the intervention period were significantly associated with HR, PRP, body mass index (BMI) and visceral fat index (all correlation coefficients >0.2, p < 0.05). Compared to the control cluster group, the active cluster group obtained a significant reduction in PPS, Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total number of elevated risk factors (p < 0.05). On an individual level, significant and clinically relevant between-group reductions were observed in respect to BP, HR, PRP, total and LDL cholesterol, and total number of elevated risk factors (p < 0.05). Conclusions. The stress intervention method applied in this study induced a decrease in PPS which was associated with a clinically relevant decrease in resting blood pressure, heart rate, work of the heart and serum cholesterols.","Ballegaard, Soren; Petersen, Pernille B.; Harboe, Gitte S.; Karpatschof, Benny; Gyntelberg, Finn; Faber, Jens",0,10.3109/00365513.2013.862847,337
426,"Cultivating teacher mindfulness: Effects of a randomized controlled trial on work, home, and sleep outcomes","The effects of randomization to a workplace mindfulness training (WMT) or a waitlist control condition on teachers' well-being (moods and satisfaction at work and home), quantity of sleep, quality of sleep, and sleepiness during the day were examined in 2 randomized, waitlist controlled trials (RCTs). The combined sample of the 2 RCTs, conducted in Canada and the United States, included 113 elementary and secondary school teachers (89% female). Measures were collected at baseline, postprogram, and 3-month follow-up; teachers were randomly assigned to condition after baseline assessment. Results showed that teachers randomized to WMT reported less frequent bad moods at work and home, greater satisfaction at work and home, more sleep on weekday nights, better quality sleep, and decreased insomnia symptoms and daytime sleepiness. Training-related group differences in mindfulness and rumination on work at home at postprogram partially mediated the reductions in negative moods at home and increases in sleep quality at follow-up.

To estimate the cost to the workplace of implementing initiatives to reduce work-family conflict.Design. Prospective cost analysis conducted alongside a group-randomized multisite controlled experimental study, using a microcosting approach.Setting. An information technology firm.Subjects. Employees (n= 1004) and managers (n= 141) randomized to the intervention arm.Intervention. STAR (Start. Transform. Achieve. Results.) to enhance employees' control over their work time, increase supervisor support for employees to manage work and family responsibilities, and reorient the culture toward results.Measures. A taxonomy of activities related to customization, start-up, and implementation was developed. Resource use and unit costs were estimated for each activity, excluding researchrelated activities.Analysis. Economic costing approach (accounting and opportunity costs). Sensitivity analyses on intervention costs.Results. The total cost of STAR was $709,654, of which $389,717 was labor costs and $319,937 nonlabor costs (including $313,877 for intervention contract). The cost per employee participation in the intervention was $340 (95% confidence interval: $330-$351); $597 ($561-634) for managers and $300 ($292-308) for other employees (2011 prices).Conclusion. A detailed activity costing approach allows for more accurate cost estimates and identifies key drivers of cost. The key cost driver was employees' time spent on receiving the intervention. Ignoring this cost, which is usual in studies that cost workplace interventions, would seriously underestimate the cost of a workplace initiative.","Barbosa, Carolina; Bray, Jeremy W.; Brockwood, Krista; Reeves, Daniel",0,10.4278/ajhp.121108-QUAN-542,340

431,The effectiveness of the Training and Support Program for parents of children with disabilities: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: The Training and Support Program (TSP) was designed to equip parents of children with disabilities with a simple massage skill for use with their children in the home environment. The effectiveness of the TSP was examined in a randomized controlled trial with a wait-list control group. Methods: Parents were trained in massage by suitably qualified therapists in eight weekly sessions, each lasting 1 h. The sample comprised 188 parents who were randomized to an intervention group (n=95), who attended the TSP with their children immediately, or a control group (n=93), who were offered the TSP after 4 months of follow-up. Data were collected by self-administered questionnaires at baseline and at 4-month follow-up. Results: The majority of participants were mothers (88%), with a partner (88%), and White European (82%); 40% worked full-time or part-time, and 34% had health problems (e.g., chronic fatigue, cancer, and arthritis). The TSP demonstrated statistically significant positive effects on parental self-efficacy (PSE) for managing children's psychosocial well-being and depressed mood (0.004 and 0.007). There were trends toward improvement on parental satisfaction with life (P=.053), global health (P=.065), and parental ratings of children's sleeping (P=.074) and mobility (P=.012). Effect sizes were small (0.11-0.23). Levels of anxiety, depression, and perceived stress were all higher than published norms. Conclusion: The TSP is an effective means of improving PSE and depressed mood. Additional means of supporting parents need to be investigated. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, so far, a comprehensive meta-analysis on the efficacy is lacking.Design: Included studies either compare the efficacy of a specific training with a control group or look at the additional effect of booster sessions on communication behaviour, attitudes or patient outcomes.Methods: Four electronic databases were searched up to July 2008 without language restriction, and reference lists of earlier reviews were screened. Effect sizes (ESs) were extracted and pooled in random effects meta-analyses.Results: We included 13 trials (three non-randomised), 10 with no specific intervention in the control group. Meta-analysis showed a moderate effect of CST on communication behaviour ES = 0.54. Three trials compared basic training courses with more extensive training courses and showed a small additional effect on communication skills ES = 0.37. Trials investigating participants' attitudes ES = 0.35 and patient outcomes ES = 0.13 (trend) confirmed this effect.Conclusions: Training health professionals by CST is a promising approach to change communication behaviour and attitudes. Patients might also benefit from specifically trained health professionals but strong studies are lacking. However, feasibility and economic aspects have to be kept in mind when considering providing a training of optimal length.","Barth, J.; Lannen, P.",0,10.1093/annonc/mdq441,343
435,"A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Trauma-Informed Support, Skills, and Psychoeducation Intervention for Survivors of Torture and Related Trauma in Kurdistan, Northern Iraq","Providing survivors of torture, imprisonment, and/or military attacks with a counseling program that includes support, skills and psychoeducation by well-trained and supervised community mental health workers can result in moderate yet meaningful improvements in depression and dysfunction.Supportive counseling type interventions are frequently provided to meet the mental health needs of populations in emergency and post-conflicts contexts, but it has seldom been rigorously evaluated. Existing evaluations from low-and middle-income countries provide mixed evidence of effectiveness. While Iraqi Kurdistan experienced relative stability following the fall of Saddam Hussein's government, the population in the northern Dohuk region has continued to experience periodic violence due to conflicts with neighboring Turkey as well as more recent ISIS-associated violence. We evaluated the impact of a trauma-informed support, skills, and psychoeducation intervention provided by community mental health workers (CMHWs) on depressive symptoms and dysfunction (primary outcomes) as well as post-traumatic stress, traumatic grief, and anxiety symptoms (secondary outcomes). Between June 2009 and June 2010, 295 adults were screened; 209 (71%) met eligibility criteria (trauma exposure and a symptom severity score indicating significant distress and functional impairment, among others) and consented to participate. Of these, 159 were randomized to supportive counseling while 50 were randomized to a waitlist control condition. Comparing average symptom severity scores post-treatment among those in the intervention group with those in the waitlist control group, the supportive counseling program had statistically and clinically significant impacts on the primary outcomes of depression (Cohen's d, 0.57; P=.02) and dysfunction (Cohen's d, 0.53; P=.03) and significant but smaller impacts on anxiety. Although studies by the same research team of psychotherapeutic interventions in other parts of Kurdistan and in southern Iraq found larger effects, this study adds to the global research literature on mental health and psychosocial support and shows that a well-trained and supervised program of trauma-informed support, skills, and psychoeducation that emphasizes the therapeutic relationship can also be effective.","Bass, Judith; Murray, Sarah Mclvor; Mohammed, Thikra Ahmed; Bunn, Mary; Gorman, William; Ahmed, Ahmed Mohammed Amin; Murray, Laura; Bolton, Paul",0,10.9745/GHSP-D-16-00017,344
436,Depression in homeless mothers: Addressing an unrecognized public health issue,"Homeless mothers experience disproportionately high rates of major depressive disorder compared with the general population. Stressed by their circumstances, these women struggle to protect their families. Children living with a depressed parent have poorer medical, mental health, and educational outcomes. Despite the adverse impact on children, depression among mothers experiencing homelessness remains unacknowledged, unrecognized, and untreated. This article reviews the evidence supporting preventive and therapeutic interventions with lowincome and homeless mothers and children, and finds that few services have been adapted and evaluated for use in the homelessness service system. Based on the robust evidence describing positive outcomes in programs for low-income parents with depression, the authors propose guidelines for adapting and implementing services directly by programs serving homeless families. Once families are housed and urgent issues addressed, they recommend assessing all family members, routinely providing culturally competent parenting supports, trauma-informed services, and treatment for major depressive disorders. They also emphasize the critical importance of creating child-centered spaces and developmental services for the children. To ensure quality care, training must be available for the staff. Given the increasing numbers of homeless families and high rates of maternal depression and its negative impact on children, support for these programs should become a high public health priority.

438,Stress management intervention for primary prevention of hypertension: Detailed results from phase I of trials of hypertension prevention (TOHP-I),"PURPOSE: Stress Management Intervention (SMI) was one of seven nonpharmacologic approaches evaluated in Phase I Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP-I) for efficacy in lowering diastolic blood pressure (BP) in healthy men and women aged 30 to 54 years with diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg. METHODS: A total of 242 and 320 participants were randomized to SMI or an 'assessment only' SMI Control, respectively, at four clinical centers. The SMI consisted of 37 contact hours in 21 group and two individual meetings over 18 months and included: training in four relaxation methods, techniques to reduce stress reactions, cognitive approaches, communication skills, time management, and anger management within a general problem-solving format. Standardized protocols detailed methods and timing for collecting BP, psychosocial measures, and urinary samples from both SMI and SMI Control participants. RESULTS: In intention-to-treat analyses, although significant baseline to termination BP reductions were observed in both groups, net differences between the SMI and SMI Control groups' BP changes (mean (95% CI)) were not significant: -0.82 (-1.86, 0.22) for diastolic BP, and -0.47 (-1.96, 1.01) for systolic BP. Extensive adherence sub-group analyses found one effect: a significant 1.36 mm Hg (p = 0.01) reduction in diastolic BP relative to SMI Controls at the end of the trial for SMI participants who completed 61% or more of intervention sessions. CONCLUSIONS: While the TOHP-I SMI was acceptable to participants as evident from high levels of session completion, the absence of demonstrated BP lowering efficacy in intention-to-treat analyses suggests that the TOHP-I SMI is an unlikely candidate for primary prevention of hypertension in a general population sample similar to study participants. The isolated finding of significant diastolic BP lowering in SMI participants with higher adherence provides very weak evidence of SMI BP lowering efficacy and may be a chance finding. Whether similar or other stress management interventions can produce significant BP lowering in populations selected for higher levels of BP, stress, or intervention adherence remains to be demonstrated.

Given the high comorbidity of these conditions, however, it would be helpful if more broadly focused therapies were available that simultaneously targeted common functional processes underlying the multiple problems of the dually diagnosed. Both PTSD and substance abuse can be conceptualized as disorders with significant experiential avoidance components.

Substantial increase of sick listing, reports of work disabilities and early retirement due to stress and musculoskeletal chronic pain suggest a need for methods of preventing loss of function resulting from these conditions. The present preliminary investigation examined the effects of a brief Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) intervention for the treatment of public health sector workers who showed chronic stress/pain and were at risk for high sick leave utilization. ACT was compared in an additive treatment design with medical treatment as usual (MTAU). A group of 19 participants were randomly distributed into 2 groups. Both conditions received MTAU. The ACT condition received four 1-hour weekly sessions of ACT in addition to MTAU. At post and 6-month follow-up, ACT participants showed fewer sick days and used fewer medical treatment resources than those in the MTAU condition. No significant differences were found in levels of pain, stress, or quality of life. Improvements in sick leave and medical utilization could not be accounted for by remission of stress and pain in the ACT group as no between-group differences were found for stress or pain symptoms.

443,Health psychology: Mapping biobehavioral contributions to health and illness,"Our evolving understanding of how psychosocial and behavioral factors affect health and disease processes has been marked by investigation of specific relationships and mechanisms underlying them. Stress and other emotional responses are components of complex interactions of genetic, physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors that affect the body's ability to remain or become healthy or to resist or overcome disease. Regulated by nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, and exerting powerful influence on other bodily systems and key health-relevant behaviors, stress and emotion appear to have important implications for the initiation or progression of cancer, HIV, cardiovascular disease, and other illnesses. Health-enhancing and health-impairing behaviors, including diet, exercise, tobacco use, and protection from the sun, can compromise or benefit health and are directed by a number of influences as well. Finally, health behaviors related to being ill or trying to avoid disease or its severest consequences are important. Seeking care and adhering to medical regimens and recommendations for disease surveillance allow for earlier identification of health threats and more effective treatment. Evidence that biobehavioral factors are linked to health in integrated, complex ways continues to mount, and knowledge of these influences has implications for medical outcomes and health care practice.

444,Melatonin ameliorates oxidative damage induced by maternal lead exposure in rat pups,"During the particular period of cerebellum development, exposure to lead (Pb) decreases cerebellum growth and can result in selective loss of neurons. The detection and prevention of Pb toxicity is a major international public health priorities. This research study was conducted to evaluate the effects of melatonin, an effective antioxidant and free radical scavenger, on Pb induced neurotoxicity and oxidative stress in the cerebellum. Pb exposure was initiated on gestation day 5 with the addition of daily doses of 0.2% lead acetate to distilled drinking water and continues until weaning. Melatonin (10. mg/kg) was given once daily at the same time. 21. days after birth, several antioxidant enzyme activities including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were assayed. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) levels were measured as a marker of lipid peroxidation. Rotarod and locomotor activity tests were performed on postnatal days (PDs) 31-33 and a histological study was performed after completion of behavioral measurements on PD 33. The results of the present work demonstrated that Pb could induce lipid peroxidation, increase TBARS levels and decrease GPx and SOD activities in the rat cerebellum. We also observed that Pb impaired performance on the rotarod and locomotor activities of rats. However, treatment with melatonin significantly attenuated the motoric impairment and lipid peroxidation process and restored the levels of antioxidants. Histological analysis indicated that Pb could decrease Purkinje cell count and melatonin prevented this toxic effect. These results suggest that treatment with melatonin can improve motor deficits and oxidative stress by protecting the cerebellum against Pb toxicity.

446,Increasing access to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy in Low and Middle Income Countries: A strategic framework,"Cognitive Behaviour Therapy has been demonstrated to be an effective intervention in outpatient and inpatient settings for a wide range of presenting mental health problems including depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Post traumatic Stress Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder and Somatorform Disorder. There is likely to be an unmet need for this therapeutic approach in most Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC). However, the training of therapists to deliver this intervention has historically been a lengthy and expensive process, with already highly trained staff such as psychiatrists and psychologists undertaking additional training of up to one year duration in order to develop expertise in this area. This paper proposes that a model where training, supervision, leadership and service evaluation is provided by a small number of highly trained staff to front-line non-specialist staff who will then deliver manualised therapy. These front-line staff may also be conceptualised as part of a stepped care model where self-help and manualised therapy approaches are used in the first instance. Where patient functioning does not improve there is then the possibility of being stepped-up for treatment by a more specialised and highly trained therapist. This approach may help in meeting the huge mental health treatment gap in LMIC. This paper also suggests that lessons learnt from the dissemination of behaviourally informed parenting interventions internationally can be applied to the dissemination of this therapeutic approach.

Among those that do, the dropout rate is high and more than 50% retain their diagnosis after treatment. This study evaluated the efficacy of Trauma Management Therapy (TMT), delivered in a 3-week intensive outpatient (IOP) format. TMT combines virtual-reality augmented individual exposure therapy with a group intervention to address social isolation, anger, and depression. One hundred twelve (112) OIF/OEF/OND veterans and active duty personnel participated. Assessment included measures of PTSD, sleep, depression, anger, guilt, and social isolation, administered at post-treatment, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. The effect size for TMT delivered in an IOP format was 2.06, with 65.9% no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for PTSD. There were similar positive effects in other domains and treatment gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. The results are discussed regarding the need for efficacious, multi-component interventions that can be delivered safely and rapidly, and the potential of this approach towards that end.

A history of panic attacks (PA) may convey risk for postdisaster psychopathology and has been linked to a wide range of psychiatric disorders in Western and non-Western samples. The present study examined the main and interactive effects of pretyphoon PA and level of typhoon exposure in the onset of posttyphoon posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression (MDD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in a Vietnamese sample of typhoon survivors. Methods Typhoon Xangsane interrupted a Vietnamese epidemiological mental health needs assessment, providing a rare opportunity for preand posttyphoon assessments. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses evaluated whether the main and interactive effects of typhoon exposure severity and PA history were significantly related to posttyphoon diagnoses, above and beyond age, health status, pretyphoon psychiatric screening results, and history of potentially traumatic events. Results PA history moderated the relationship between severity of typhoon exposure and posttyphoon PTSD and MDD, but not GAD. Specifically, greater degree of exposure to the typhoon was significantly related to increased likelihood of postdisaster PTSD and MDD among individuals without a history of PA, above and beyond variance accounted for by pretyphoon psychiatric screening results. Individuals with a history of PA evidenced greater risk for postdisaster PTSD and MDD regardless of severity of typhoon exposure. Conclusions Preexisting PA may affect the nature of the relationship between disaster characteristics and prevalence of postdisaster PTSD and MDD within Vietnamese samples.

452,Non-specialist psychosocial support interventions for women living with HIV: A systematic review,"Many women living with HIV experience a range of physical, social, and psychological challenges linked to their HIV status. Psychosocial support interventions may help women cope with these challenges and may allow women to make better decisions around their sexual and reproductive health (SRH), yet no reviews have summarized the evidence for the impact of such interventions on well-being and SRH decision-making among women living with HIV. We systematically reviewed the evidence for non-specialist delivered psychosocial support interventions for women living with HIV, which are particularly relevant in low-resource settings. Outcomes of interest included mental, emotional, social well-being and/or quality of life, common mental health disorders, and SRH decision-making. Searching was conducted through four electronic databases and secondary reference screening. Systematic methods were used for screening and data abstraction. Nine articles met the inclusion criteria, showing positive or mixed results for well-being and depressive symptoms indicators. No studies reported on SRH decision-making outcomes. The available evidence suggests that psychosocial support interventions may improve self-esteem, coping and social support, and reduce depression, stress, and perceived stigma. However, evidence is mixed. Most studies placed greater emphasis on instrumental health outcomes to prevent HIV transmission than on the intrinsic well-being and SRH of women living with HIV. Many interventions included women living with HIV in their design and implementation. More research is required to understand the most effective interventions, and their effect on sexual and reproductive health and rights. Â© 2017 The Author(s).

453,Early Psychologically Informed Interventions for Workers at Risk for Pain-Related Disability: Does Matching Treatment to Profile Improve Outcome?,"Purpose This randomized controlled trial had two main aims. The first aim was to investigate the effect of early preventive, psychologically informed, interventions for pain-related disability. The second aim was explore whether people who are matched to an intervention specifically targeting their psychological risk profile had better outcomes than people who were not matched to interventions. Methods A total of 105 participants were recruited from their workplace, screened for psychological risk factors and classified as being at risk for long-term pain-related disability. They were subgrouped into one of three groups based on their psychological profile. Three behaviorally oriented psychological interventions were developed to target each of the three risk profiles. Half of the participants were assigned a matched intervention developed to target their specific profile, and half were assigned an unmatched intervention. After treatment, repeated measure ANOVAs and chi(2) tests were used to determine if treatments had an effect on primary and secondary outcomes including perceived disability, sick leave, fear and avoidance, pain catastrophizing and distress, and if matched participants had better outcomes than did unmatched. Results Treatments had effects on all outcome variables (effect sizes d ranging between 0.23 and 0.66), but matched participants did not have better outcomes than unmatched. Conclusions Early, preventive interventions have an impact on a number of outcome variables but it is difficult to realize a matching procedure. More in-depth research of the process of matching is needed.","Bergbom, Sofia; Flink, Ida K. L.; Boersma, Katja; Linton, Steven J.",0,10.1007/s10926-013-9478-1,356
454,A School-Based Intervention for Reducing Posttraumatic Symptomatology and Intolerance During Political Violence,"Studies indicate that individuals who are exposed to political violence and who experience personal threat and posttraumatic distress might also develop prejudicial and exclusionist attitudes toward outgroup members. To tackle this destructive dynamics in children, the authors implemented a 2-pronged approach, combining stress-reduction interventions with strategies geared to reducing stereotyping and discriminatory tendencies toward the other. A teacher-delivered universal school-based program, ERASE-Stress-Pro-Social (ESPS), was designed and implemented with Jewish Israeli students exposed to the 2008 Gaza War. Two hundred students from third to sixth grade were assigned to either 16 sessions of ESPS intervention (n = 99) or to a regular social skills (SS) program as a control group (n = 101). They were assessed on posttraumatic symptomatology (PTS), anxiety, somatic complaints, and functional problems, as well as stereotyping and discriminatory tendencies toward White, Arab, and Ethiopian children at 2 time-points: before the intervention and 2 months later. Elementary school students exposed to security threats and war exhibited significant levels of PTS distress as well as stereotyping and discriminatory tendencies toward Arab and Ethiopian children. Two months after the program ended, students in the ESPS group showed significant reduction on all measures compared to the SS group. Results show a strong link between PTS reduction and changes in attitudes toward Arabs. The ESPS program might help reduce PTS as well as prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory tendencies toward minorities in children exposed to political violence, thereby helping to preserve the democratic values and the delicate fabric of our multicultural societies.

455,Psychological flexibility moderates the relation between PTSD symptoms and daily pain interference,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are associated with increased physical health problems, including chronic pain. Although researchers have identified several risk factors that partially account for the co-occurrence of PTSD symptoms and pain, a substantial amount of variance remains unexplained in these models. The present study evaluated psychological flexibility (PF) as a potential moderator of the relation between probable PTSD diagnosis and pain interference in daily life. Probable PTSD participants reported significantly greater daily pain severity and interference, and greater daily pain interference when controlling for pain severity, relative to non-PTSD participants. PF emerged as a significant moderator of the relation of PTSD and pain interference. Participants with probable PTSD reported greater pain interference only in conjunction with low levels of PF. Results suggest psychosocial treatments that target PF as a means of improving functioning may improve outcomes for patients with co-occurring PTSD and chronic pain.

456,Children exposed to community violence: The rationale for early intervention,"Children are exposed to violence in their homes and communities at extraordinarily high rates. Given the alarming rates of exposure and its known impact on child developmental outcomes, crisis intervention geared at interrupting the negative effects of violence exposure are increasingly important. This review provides a rationale for the implementation of early and crisis intervention strategies for children exposed to community violence and recommends principles for applying these interventions. These principles are based on the body of research concerning risk and protective factors for children who have been exposed to violence. Relevant factors are reviewed and recommended principles are explicated that correlate to these factors. Issues concerning developmentally informed crisis intervention, support of parental executive functioning, and the need for active community partnership to help ameliorate risk factors are highlighted.",Berkowitz S.J.,0,10.1023/B:CCFP.0000006295.54479.3d,359
458,The (cost-)effectiveness of a lifestyle physical activity intervention in addition to a work style intervention on the recovery from neck and upper limb symptoms in computer workers,"Background: Neck and upper limb symptoms are frequently reported by computer workers. Work style interventions are most commonly used to reduce work-related neck and upper limb symptoms but lifestyle physical activity interventions are becoming more popular to enhance workers health and reduce work-related symptoms. A combined approach targeting work style and lifestyle physical activity seems promising, but little is known on the effectiveness of such combined interventions.Methods/design: The RSI@ Work study is a randomised controlled trial that aims to assess the added value of a lifestyle physical activity intervention in addition to a work style intervention to reduce neck and upper limb symptoms in computer workers. Computer workers from seven Dutch companies with frequent or long-term neck and upper limb symptoms in the preceding six months and/or the last two weeks are randomised into three groups: ( 1) work style group, ( 2) work style and physical activity group, or ( 3) control group. The work style intervention consists of six group meetings in a six month period that take place at the workplace, during work time, and under the supervision of a specially trained counsellor. The goal of this intervention is to stimulate workplace adjustment and to improve body posture, the number and quality of breaks and coping behaviour with regard to high work demands. In the combined ( work style and physical activity) intervention the additional goal is to increase moderate to heavy physical activity. The control group receives usual care. Primary outcome measures are degree of recovery, pain intensity, disability, number of days with neck and upper limb symptoms, and number of months without neck and upper limb symptoms. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and six and 12 months after randomisation. Cost-effectiveness of the group meetings will be assessed using an employer's perspective.Discussion: This study will be one of the first to assess the added value of a lifestyle physical activity intervention in addition to a work style intervention in reducing neck and upper limb symptoms of computer workers. The results of the study are expected in 2007.","Bernaards, Claire M.; Ariens, Geertje A. M.; Hildebrandt, Vincent H.",0,10.1186/1471-2474-7-80,360
459,"Construction and evaluation of a self rating scale for stress-induced Exhaustion Disorder, the Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale","Prolonged stress (â‰¥ six months) may cause a condition which has been named exhaustion disorder (ED) with ICD-10 code F43.8. ED is characterised by exhaustion, cognitive problems, poor sleep and reduced tolerance to further stress. ED can cause long term disability and depressive symptoms may develop. The aim was to construct and evaluate a self-rating scale, the Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale (KEDS), for the assessment of ED symptoms. A second aim was to examine the relationship between self-rated symptoms of ED, depression, and anxiety using KEDS and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD). Items were selected based on their correspondence to criteria for ED as formulated by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW), with seven response alternatives in a Likert-format. Self-ratings performed by 317 clinically assessed participants were used to analyse the scale's psychometric properties. KEDS consists of nine items with a scale range of 0-54. Receiver operating characteristics analysis demonstrated that a cut-off score of 19 was accompanied by high sensitivity and specificity (each above 95%) in the discrimination between healthy subjects and patients with ED. Reliability was satisfactory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed that ED, depression and anxiety are best regarded as different phenomena. KEDS may be a useful tool in the assessment of symptoms of Exhaustion Disorder in clinical as well as research settings. There is evidence that the symptom clusters of ED, anxiety and depression, respectively, reflect three different underlying dimensions. Â© 2013 The Authors.

460,A systematic review and meta-analysis of the intergenerational transmission of criminal behavior,"Children whose parents exhibit criminal behavior (CB) appear to have an increased risk of displaying CB themselves. We conducted a systematic review and pooled results from 23 samples in 25 publications (including 3,423,483 children) in this meta-analysis of intergenerational transmission of CB. On average, children with criminal parents were at significantly higher risk for CB compared with children without criminal parents (pooled OR = 2.4). Studies taking into account covariates also showed increased risk for CB (pooled OR = 1.8). Transmission was strongest from mothers to daughters, followed by mothers to sons, fathers to daughters, and fathers to sons. Moreover, transmission appeared stronger for cohorts born after 1981. When we examined methodological quality and other characteristics of studies, response rates, sample size, or use of official records vs. self- or other-reports of parental CB did not moderate outcomes. However, we found stronger transmission for samples that used convenience or case-control sampling, and in studies in which parental CB clearly preceded offspring CB. We discuss mechanisms underlying intergenerational transmission, including social learning, criminogenic environments, biological proneness, and criminal justice bias. Finally, we consider limitations and directions for future research as well as policy implications for breaking the cycle of intergenerational crime.

462,Yoga and the promotion of health,"The scope of this paper is to analyze the self-declared symptoms and state of well-being of participants in the ""Yoga and Promotion of Health"" program, which consisted of hatha yoga lessons. It includes body exercises and breathing techniques, as well as ethical and philosophical content, administered to two groups of lecturers, workers and students of a public university in the State of Sao Paulo from August to December 2011 and March to June 2012. The participants filled out the adapted version of the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile form at the beginning and end of the program. Of the 20 participants in Group 1, eight filled out the form and half of them reported the improvement of self-declared symptoms; as regards the state of well being, three of them felt they had improved. In Group 2, which also had 20 participants, nine completed the program and all of them reported improvements of self-declared symptoms and well-being. In conclusion, yoga is a mind-body practice which exerts an important therapeutic effect on most practitioners and also promotes health for the majority of them, expanding their capacity of self perception and self care. However, it should be noted that it doesn't achieve the same positive effect for all practitioners as some yoga traditions advocate.","de Barros, Nelson Filice; Siegel, Pamela; de Moura, Soraia Maria; Cavalari, Thais Adriana; da Silva, Luis Geraldo; Furlanetti, Maria Renata; Goncalves, Andrea Vasconcelos",1,10.1590/1413-81232014194.01732013,363
464,The Epidemiology of Acute Stress Disorder and Other Early Responses to Trauma in Adults,"Acute stress disorder (ASD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by exposure to a traumatic event followed by symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, hyper-arousal, peritraumatic dissociation, and impairment in functioning. ASD's time-limited duration (two days to one month) makes it distinct from but related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is diagnosed after one month. ASD's brief duration has contributed to a dearth of largescale, population-based studies. Smaller studies have sought to determine rates of ASD after specific events in select populations; others have focused on ASD's role in predicting PTSD. Much can be learned from existing epidemiological studies. ASD's prevalence varies from 3% in a population of accident victims to 59% in female sexual assault victims. Female gender is a key risk factor; marital status, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status have also been associated with ASD in some studies. Comorbidities include depressive and anxiety disorders and substance use disorders. Â© 2012 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

467,Psychological treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).,"BACKGROUND: Psychological interventions are widely used in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of all psychological treatments except eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing following the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration.SEARCH STRATEGY: Systematic searches of computerised databases, hand search of the Journal of Traumatic Stress, searches of reference lists, known websites and discussion fora, and personal communication with key workers.SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies - Any randomised controlled trial of a psychological treatment. Types of participants - Adults suffering from traumatic stress symptoms for three months or more. Types of interventions - Trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy/exposure therapy (TFCBT); stress management (SM); other therapies (supportive therapy, non-directive counselling, psychodynamic therapy and hypnotherapy); group cognitive behavioural therapy (group CBT). Types of outcomes - Severity of clinician rated traumatic stress symptoms. Secondary measures included self-reported traumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, adverse effects and dropouts.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data was entered using the Review Management software. Quality assessments were performed. The data were analysed for summary effects using the RevMan 4.2 programme.MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies were included in the review. With regards to reduction of clinician assessed PTSD symptoms TFCBT did significantly better than waitlist/usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -1.36; 95% CI, -1.88 to -0.84; 13 studies; n = 609). There was no significant difference between TFCBT and SM (SMD = -0.27; 95% CI, -0.71 to 0.16; 6 studies; n = 239). TFCBT did significantly better than other therapies (SMD = -0.81; 95% CI, -1.19 to -0.42; 3 studies; n = 120). Stress management did significantly better than waitlist/usual care (SMD = -1.14; 95% CI, -1.62 to -0.67; 3 studies; n = 86) and than other therapies (SMD = -1.22; 95% CI, -2.09 to -0.35; 1 study; n = 25). There was no significant difference between other therapies and waitlist/usual care control (SMD = -0.43; 95% CI, -0.90 to 0.04; 2 studies; n = 72). Group TFCBT was significantly better than waitlist/usual care (SMD = -0.72; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.31).AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was evidence that individual TFCBT, stress management and group TFCBT are effective in the treatment of PTSD. Other non-trauma focused psychological treatments did not reduce PTSD symptoms as significantly. There was some evidence that individual TFCBT is superior to stress management in the treatment of PTSD at between 2 and 5 months following treatment, and also that TFCBT was also more effective than other therapies. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether psychological treatment is harmful. There was some evidence of greater drop-out in active treatment groups.","Bisson, J; Andrew, M",0,,365
469,Leg symptoms of healthy people and their treatment with compression hosiery,"Objectives: Occasional leg symptoms, like feelings of heaviness and tension, and occupational or evening oedema are considered typical features of a venous disorder but show low specificity in epidemiological and observational studies. We evaluated the prevalence and nature of such symptoms in subjects with no history or signs of venous disease and investigated the optimal strength that medical compression stockings (MCS) should exert in order to alleviate the symptoms and to prevent leg swelling.Methods: Specifically designed questionnaires were used to assess the symptoms of 40 healthy employees of a factory producing MCS. Lower leg volumes were quantified in the morning and evening. Calf size hosiery providing documented ankle pressures of 4-9 (mean 7.3), 12-18 (mean 14.9) and 18-22 (mean 19.5) mmHg, respectively, were tested in a prospective, open-label, randomized trial lasting three weeks. Endpoints were the relief of symptoms, prevention of vesperal oedema and comfort in wearing the stockings.Results: Sixty-five percent of the participants reported at least occasional leg symptoms and oedema. Somatic-type symptoms (i.e. pain, heaviness, swelling, unattractive legs) were present in two, psychic-type symptoms (i.e. leg-and personality-related unrest and stress) in 17 and both components in seven of the 40 subjects. MCS exerting 15 and 20 mmHg prevented the symptoms and oedema. Stockings providing 10 mmHg were ineffective and those providing > 19 mmHg were not well-tolerated. The effect on the somatic-type symptoms was strongly correlated with the amount of lower leg volume which could be reduced by wearing stockings (P = 0.005). No correlation was found between the efficacy of compression and the emotional component of the symptoms.Conclusion: The cause of occasional pain in the legs of apparently healthy people is unknown. Some features of the syndrome reflect an emotional disorder while others mirror venous insufficiency. MCS of 15 mmHg effectively relieve the symptoms resembling venous insufficiency, prevent oedema and are well-tolerated.","Blaettler, W.; Kreis, N.; Lun, B.; Winiger, J.; Amsler, F.",0,10.1258/phleb.2008.008014,366
471,Work-site health promotion of frequent computer users: Comparing selected interventions,"OBJECTIVE: Frequent computer use is associated with an increase in musculoskeletal complaints. The present study aims at comparing the relative efficacy of three novel interventions for the preventions of musculoskeletal complaints in frequent computer users.PARTICIPANTS: 93 employees (56 woman, 37 men, mean age 40.1 +/- 8.8 years) with frequent computer use.METHODS: Participants were assigned on the basis of preference to one of the following interventions of 8 week duration: Nordic Walking (NW), biofeedback assisted relaxation and stretching (BFB), balance exercises on a wobble board (BAL) or a waiting list control group. Outcome measures were musculoskeletal complaints, emotional well-being, fatigue, job dissatisfaction as well as neuromuscular activity in the neck/shoulder region at rest and during computer work assessed before and after the intervention and at 3 months follow-up.RESULTS: The average number of training-units per week was 2.2 +/- 0.8, 5.5 +/- 3.5 and 4.1 +/- 2.9 for NW, BFB and BAL, respectively. NW led to short and medium term improvement of musculoskeletal complaints, BFB to a short term improvement of musculoskeletal complaints. Effects on the well-being related variables or on neuromuscular activity were not found. BAL had no effect on the studied variables.CONCLUSION: NW and to a limited extent BFB are interventions potentially useful for reducing musculoskeletal complaints in frequent computer users.","Blasche, Gerhard; Pfeffer, Manuela; Thaler, Helga; Gollner, Erwin",0,10.3233/WOR-121520,367
472,Critical incident stress management (CISM): benefit or risk for emergency services?,"BACKGROUND: Critical incident stress management (CISM) has become a common practice in modern emergency services. Described in 1983 as critical incident stress debriefing (CISD), CISM was originally marketed to help emergency personnel deal with ostensibly stressful situations they would encounter as a part of their work.OBJECTIVE: To review the status of the medical and psychological literature regarding the efficacy and safety of CISM.METHODS: Several pertinent databases were accessed and searched for scientific articles pertaining to CISM. These were subsequently analyzed for methodology and pertinence to the study topic.RESULTS: Numerous scientific articles were found concerning CISM. Several high-quality studies were identified, but many other studies lacked adequate methodology sufficient for use in an evidence-based medicine approach. Others were from trade magazines, non-refereed journals, and obscure mental health journals. Several meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were found. Overall, these studies show that, at best, CISM has no effect on preventing psychiatric sequelae following a traumatic event, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, several studies report possible paradoxical worsening of stress-related symptoms in patients and personnel receiving CISM.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of the existing literature base, several meta-analyses and RCTs found CISM to be ineffective in preventing PTSD. Several studies found possible iatrogenic worsening of stress-related symptoms in persons who received CISM. Because of this, CISM should be curtailed or utilized only with extreme caution in emergency services until additional high-quality studies can verify its effectiveness and provide mechanisms to limit paradoxical outcomes. It should never be a mandatory intervention.","Bledsoe, Bryan E",0,10.1080/10903120390936941,368

The objective of this study was to assess perceived barriers to self-management among patients with both SMI and DM in order to inform healthcare delivery practices. Methods: We conducted 20 indepth interviews with persons who had diagnoses of both SMI and DM. All interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using content analysis with an emphasis on dominant themes. Results: Transcript-based analysis generated 3 major domains of barriers to disease self-management among patients with both DM and SMI: (1) personal level barriers (stress, isolation, stigma); (2) family and community level barriers (lack of support from family and friends); and (3) provider and health care system level barriers (poor relationships and communication with providers, fragmentation of care). Conclusions: Care approaches that provide social support, help in managing stress, optimize communication with providers, and reduce compartmentalization of medical and psychiatric care are needed to help these vulnerable individuals avoid health complications and premature mortality.","Blixen, Carol E.; Kanuch, Stephanie; Perzynski, Adam T.; Thomas, Charles; Dawson, Neal V.; Sajatovic, Martha",0,10.5993/AJHB.40.2.4,369
474,"The development of an RDoC-based treatment program for adolescent depression: ""Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action"" (TARA)","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the current leading causes of disability worldwide. Adolescence is a vulnerable period for the onset of depression, with MDD affecting 8-20% of all youth. Traditional treatment methods have not been sufficiently effective to slow the increasing prevalence of adolescent depression.We therefore propose a new model for the treatment of adolescent depression - Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA) -that is based on current understanding of developmental and depression neurobiology.TheTARA model is aligned with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of the National Institute of Mental Health. In this article, we first address the relevance of RDoC to adolescent depression. Second, we identify the major RDoC domains of function involved in adolescent depression and organize them in a way that gives priority to domains thought to be driving the psychopathology.Third, we select therapeutic training strategies for TARA based on current scientific evidence of efficacy for the prioritized domains of function in a manner that maximizes time, resources, and feasibility.The TARA model takes into consideration the developmental limitation in top-down cognitive control in adolescence and promotes bottom-up strategies such as vagal afference to decrease limbic hyperactivation and its secondary effects. The program has been informed by mindfulness-based therapy and yoga, as well as modern psychotherapeutic techniques.The treatment program is semi-manualized, progressive, and applied in a module-based approach designed for a group setting that is to be conducted one session per week for 12 weeks. We hope that this work may form the basis for a novel and more effective treatment strategy for adolescent depression, as well as broaden the discussion on how to address this challenge.

475,Exercise to reduce work-related fatigue among employees: a randomized controlled trial,"Objectives The present study evaluated the efficacy of an exercise intervention to reduce work-related fatigue (emotional exhaustion, overall fatigue, and need for recovery). The effects of exercise on self-efficacy, sleep, work ability, cognitive functioning and aerobic fitness (secondary outcomes) were also investigated.Methods Employees with high levels of work-related fatigue were randomly assigned to either a 6-week exercise intervention (EL N=49) or a wait-list control group (WLC; N=47). All participants were measured pre-(TO) and post-intervention (Ti). El participants were also measured 6 (T2) and 12 weeks (T3) after the end of the intervention. Analyses were based on intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP). PP analyses only included El participants (N=31) who completed the intervention and WLC participants (N= 35) who did not increase their exercise level during the wait period.Results Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed that, at Ti, the El group reported lower emotional exhaustion and overall fatigue than the WLC group, however, only according to PP analyses. Both according to ITT and PP analyses, El participants showed higher sleep quality, workability, and self-reported cognitive functioning at Ti compared to WLC participants. Intervention effects were maintained at T2 and T3.Conclusions The exercise intervention had enduring effects on work-related fatigue and broader indicators of employee well-being. This study demonstrates that, in case of work-related fatigue, exercise does constitute a powerful medicine for those who comply with the treatment.","de Vries, Juriena D.; van Hoof, Madeon L.

476,Efficacy of an exercise intervention for employees with work-related fatigue: study protocol of a two-arm randomized controlled trial,"Background: The aim of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of an exercise intervention to reduce work-related fatigue. Exercise is a potentially effective intervention strategy to reduce work-related fatigue, since it may enhance employees' ability to cope with work stress and it helps to detach from work. However, based on available research, no clear causal inferences regarding its efficacy can be made. This RCT therefore investigates whether exercise is effective in reducing work-related fatigue, and in improving other indicators of employees' mental and physical well-being and performance.Methods/design: A two-arm parallel trial will be conducted. Participants (N = 108) who experience high levels of work-related fatigue will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to a 6-week exercise intervention or wait list (control). The exercise intervention consists of three one-hour low-intensity outdoor running sessions a week. Each week, two sessions take place in a group under supervision of a trainer, and one session is completed individually. The running sessions will be carried out during leisure time. The primary outcome is work-related fatigue. Secondary outcomes include work ability, self-efficacy, sleep quality, cognitive functioning, and aerobic fitness. These data will be collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the intervention. In addition, weekly measures of employees' well-being, and exercise activities (i.e. type, frequency, and duration) and experiences (i.e. pleasure, effort, and detachment) will be collected during the intervention period.Discussion: This study will compare an exercise intervention to a wait list. This enables us to examine the effect of exercise on work-related fatigue compared to the natural course of these symptoms. As such, this study contributes to a better understanding of the causal link between exercise and work-related fatigue. If the intervention is proven effective, the results could provide a basis for future 'effectiveness' trials in which the (implementation of the) intervention can be investigated among a broader defined population in a less standardized way, eventually leading to better evidence-based policies and practices to employees, employers, health practitioners, and policy makers concerning the effect of exercise on work-related fatigue.","de Vries, Juriena D.; van Hooff, Madelon L.

477,Daily stress and social support among women with CAD: Results from a 1-year randomized controlled stress management intervention study,"Background: Psychosocial stress may play a causative role in development and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). Purpose: We investigated the effects of a 1-year stress management program on daily stress behavior and social support among female CAD patients. Method: Women, 247 (â‰¤75 years), hospitalized for a cardiac event were randomized to either a control or an intervention group. Controls obtained usual health care; intervention patients participated in 20 2-h group sessions of stress management therapy and obtained health care by a cardiologist. Measurements were at baseline, 10 weeks (after ten sessions), 1-year (end of intervention), and at a 1- to 2-year follow-up. Results: Daily stress scores for the intervention and control groups were at baseline 39.5Â±8.1 vs. 37.2Â±9.1 (p=0.06), 10 weeks 37.2Â±8.0 vs. 35.5Â±9.4 (p=0.20), 1-year 36.1Â±7.2 vs. 35.9Â±8.5 (p=0.85), and at 1-2 year follow-up 34.0Â±7.8 vs. 35.3Â±8.7 (p=0.32), respectively. Intention to treat analyses showed interaction between treatment and time [F(3,213)=2.72; p=0.01] reflecting that the decrease was more pronounced in the intervention group. There was no evidence for a difference in change concerning social support. Conclusion: CAD women in the intervention group had a more pronounced reduction of self-rated daily stress behavior over time compared to controls. However, as the intervention group had higher baseline values, due to regression toward the mean, we have no evidence that the difference in decrease of daily stress was due to the intervention.

479,Heart Healthy Online An Innovative Approach to Risk Reduction in the Workplace,"Objectives: To examine whether a Web-based cardiovascular health promotion program was associated with changes in self-reported behaviors, attitudes, and biometric indicators in a population of working adults.Methods: Employees (n = 210) were recruited and randomized into either an Internet-based or control condition. Participants completed pre- and postintervention self-report assessments on diet, exercise, smoking, and mental health. Pre- and postintervention biometric screenings were also obtained on blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and hip/waist circumference.Results: The intervention was associated with significant improvements in dietary attitudes (P = 0.003; F = 8.83), dietary intentions (P = 0.031; F = 4.72), dietary self-efficacy (P = 0.015; F = 5.97), exercise self-efficacy (P = 0.002; F = 9.51), exercise habits (P = 0.016; F = 5.94), and coping with stress (P = 0.003; F = 8.85) and depression (P = 0.036; F = 4.46).Conclusions: The program showed promise for promoting cardiovascular risk reduction behaviors. These results are consistent with similar Web-based interventions.","Deitz, Diane; Cook, Royer F.; Hersch, Rebekah K.; Leaf, Samantha",1,10.1097/JOM.0000000000000148,375
480,"Contribution of job strain, job status and marital status to laboratory and ambulatory blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension","The effects of job strain, occupational status, and marital status on blood pressure were evaluated in 99 men and women with mild hypertension. Blood pressure was measured during daily life at home and at work over 15h of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. On a separate day, blood pressure was measured in the laboratory during mental stress testing. As expected, during daily life, blood pressure was higher at work than at home. High job strain was associated with elevated systolic blood pressure among women, but not men. However, both men and women with high status occupations had significantly higher blood pressures during daily life and during laboratory mental stress testing. This was especially true for men, in that men with high job status had higher systolic blood pressures than low job status men. Marital status also was an important moderating variable, particularly for women, with married women having higher ambulatory blood pressures than single women. During mental stress testing, married persons had higher systolic blood pressures than unmarried individuals. These data suggest that occupational status and marital status may contribute even more than job strain to variations in blood pressure during daily life and laboratory testing.

484,Cognitive sequelae of blast-induced traumatic brain injury: Recovery and rehabilitation,"Blast-related traumatic brain injury (bTBI) poses a significant concern for military personnel engaged in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). Given the highly stressful context in which such injury occurs, psychiatric comorbidities are common. This paper provides an overview of mild bTBI and discusses the cognitive sequelae and course of recovery typical of mild TBI (mTBI). Complicating factors that arise in the context of co-morbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are considered with regard to diagnosis and treatment. Relatively few studies have evaluated the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation in civilian mTBI, but we discuss cognitive training approaches that hold promise for addressing mild impairments in executive function and memory, akin to those seen in OEF/OIF veterans with bTBI and PTSD. Further research is needed to address the patient and environmental characteristics associated with optimal treatment outcome.

486,How social sharing and social support explain distress in breast cancer after surgery: The role of alexithymia,"Perceived social support has shown to be key to adjustment along the cancer trajectory, but results remain contradictory about the disclosure of the experience of the illness (social sharing) and may reflect the importance of patients characteristics. The authors explored the associations between social sharing, perceived social support, and emotional adjustment in nonmetastatic breast cancer patients and how alexithymia may impact these associations. One hundred and thirteen women with breast cancer from a cancer care center in Villejuif (France) were assessed after breast surgery. Participants completed measures of depression, negative affect, and alexithymia together with a self-description of social sharing of their disease experience and perceived social support. Higher depression and negative affect were related to a high level of emotional sharing, a low satisfaction with confidant's reactions, and a high perceived negative support. In comparison with low-alexithymia patients, those with high alexithymia showed positive associations between negative emotional outcomes and (1) negative social support and (2) emotional sharing. These results suggest that the relationships between social sharing/support and emotional outcomes depend also on individual characteristics, such as alexithymia. Assessing perceived social support and alexithymia in cancer patients is useful to identify who might benefit from social sharing. Interventions could focus on helping the social network and environment to adjust to the socioemotional characteristics of breast cancer patients along the cancer trajectory.

488,Resilience to loss and potential trauma,"Initial research on loss and potentially traumatic events (PTEs) has been dominated by either a psychopathological approach emphasizing individual dysfunction or an event approach emphasizing average differences between exposed and nonexposed groups. We consider the limitations of these approaches and review more recent research that has focused on the heterogeneity of outcomes following aversive events. Using both traditional analytic tools and sophisticated latent trajectory modeling, this research has identified a set of prototypical outcome patterns. Typically, the most common outcome following PTEs is a stable trajectory of healthy functioning or resilience. We review research showing that resilience is not the result of a few dominant factors, but rather that there are multiple independent predictors of resilient outcomes. Finally, we critically evaluate the question of whether resilience-building interventions can actually make people more resilient, and we close with suggestions for future research on resilience.

489,"RCT of a client-centred, caseworker-delivered smoking cessation intervention for a socially disadvantaged population","Background: Disadvantaged groups are an important target for smoking cessation intervention. Smoking rates are markedly higher among severely socially disadvantaged groups such as indigenous people, the homeless, people with a mental illness or drug and alcohol addiction, and the unemployed than in the general population. This proposal aims to evaluate the efficacy of a client-centred, caseworker delivered cessation support intervention at increasing validated self reported smoking cessation rates in a socially disadvantaged population.Methods/Design: A block randomised controlled trial will be conducted. The setting will be a non-government organisation, Community Care Centre located in New South Wales, Australia which provides emergency relief and counselling services to predominantly government income assistance recipients. Eligible clients identified as smokers during a baseline touch screen computer survey will be recruited and randomised by a trained research assistant located in the waiting area. Allocation to intervention or control groups will be determined by time periods with clients randomised in one-week blocks. Intervention group clients will receive an intensive client-centred smoking cessation intervention offered by the caseworker over two face-to-face and two telephone contacts. There will be two primary outcome measures obtained at one, six, and 12 month follow-up: 1) 24-hour expired air CO validated self-reported smoking cessation and 2) 7-day self-reported smoking cessation. Continuous abstinence will also be measured at six and 12 months follow up.Discussion: This study will generate new knowledge in an area where the current information regarding the most effective smoking cessation approaches with disadvantaged groups is limited.Trial registration number: ISRCTN85202510","Bonevski, Billie; Paul, Christine; D'Este, Catherine; Sanson-Fisher, Robert; West, Robert; Girgis, Afaf; Siahpush, Mohammad; Carter, Robert",0,10.1186/1471-2458-11-70,380

491,Spiritual wellbeing mediates PTSD change in veterans with military-related PTSD,"Background: A portable practice of repeating a mantram - a sacred word or phrase - has been shown to reduce the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in veterans with military trauma. It is thought that the intervention re-directs attention and initiates relaxation to decrease symptom severity, but there may be other mechanisms that may contribute to this improvement. Purpose: We tested the hypothesis that increases in existential spiritual wellbeing (ESWB) would mediate reductions in self-reported PTSD symptoms following a group mantram intervention. Method: Veterans diagnosed with PTSD from war-related trauma completed 6 weeks of case management plus a group mantram intervention (n = 66) as part of a randomized trial. Measures included PTSD Checklist (PCL) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Wellbeing. Path analysis was conducted on those who completed treatment to assess ESWB as a possible mediator of change in PCL from baseline to post-treatment. Results: A significant indirect effect, -2.24, 95% CI (-4.17, -1.05) of the mantram intervention on PCL change was found. The path from the mantram intervention to ESWB change was significant and positive (B = 4.89, p < 0.0001), and the path from ESWB change to PCL change was significant and negative (B = -0.46, p = 0.001), thus supporting the hypothesis. Conclusions: Findings suggest that one contributing mechanism that partially explains how the mantram intervention reduces PTSD symptom severity in veterans may be by increasing levels of ESWB.

492,Treating deficits in emotion perception following traumatic brain injury,"The present research aimed to investigate whether social perception deficits commonly experienced in the adult traumatic brain injury (TBI) population can be successfully remediated through cognitive rehabilitation. Twelve outpatient volunteers (11 male, 1 female; age range 20-57 years) with severe, chronic TBI (mean length of post-traumatic amnesia 121 days, range 58-210 days; mean months post- injury 93.58, range 17-207 months) participated in a randomised controlled trial. Participants were randomly allocated to treatment and waitlist control groups following assessment on a range of emotion perception and psychosocial measures. Treatment comprised 25 hours, across 8 weeks, of a programme specifically designed to address emotion perception which incorporated a variety of remediation techniques shown to be effective with the TBI population. Results indicated that participants significantly improved both in judging basic emotional stimuli when presented in a naturalistic format (i.e., video vignettes) and in making social inferences on the basis of speaker demeanour. This is the first known treatment study dealing with emotion perception deficits in individuals with TBI. Â© 2007 Psychology Press.","Bornhofen C., McDonald S.",0,10.1080/09602010601061213,383
493,Psychological distress in informal caregivers of patients with dementia in primary care: course and determinants,"The course of psychological distress in informal caregivers of patients with dementia has been investigated in longitudinal studies with conflicting outcomes.We investigated the course and determinants of psychological distress in informal caregivers of patients with dementia in primary care.In this prospective observational cohort study, data were collected at baseline, after 9 and 18 months. We assessed cognition and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) of the patient (Mini-Mental State Examination and Neuropsychiatric Inventory) and psychological distress (Sense of Competence Questionnaire, Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale and General Health Questionnaire 12-tem version) of the informal caregivers. Determinants for the course of psychological distress were caregivers' age, gender and relationship with the patient, patients' cognition and NPS, participation in a care program and admission to long-term care facilities (LTCF). With linear mixed models, the course over time for psychological distress and its determinants were explored.We included 117 informal caregivers, of whom 23.1% had a high risk for depression and 41.0% were identified to be likely to have mental problems at baseline. We found a stable pattern of psychological distress over time. Higher frequency of NPS, informal caregivers' age between 50 and 70 years and being female or spouse were associated with higher psychological distress. For patients who were admitted to a LTCF during the study psychological distress of the informal caregivers improved.GPs should focus on NPS in patients with dementia and on caregivers' psychological distress and be aware of their risk for depression and mental problems, specifically to those who are spouse, female or between 50 and 70 years of age.","Borsje, Petra; Hems, Marleen A.

494,Evaluating the (cost-)effectiveness of guided and unguided Internet-based self-help for problematic alcohol use in employees - a three arm randomized controlled trial,"Background: Problematic alcohol consumption is associated with a high disease burden for affected individuals and has a detrimental impact on companies and society due to direct and indirect health costs. This protocol describes a study design to evaluate the (cost)-effectiveness of a guided and unguided Internet-based self-help intervention for employees called ""GET.ON Clever weniger trinken"" (be smart - drink less) compared to a waiting list control group.Methods: In a three-arm randomized controlled trial, 528 German adults who are currently members of the workforce will be recruited by occupational health departments of major health insurance companies. Employees aged 18 and older displaying problematic drinking patterns (>21/14 drinks per week and an AUDIT score >8/6 for men/women) will be randomly assigned to one of three following study conditions: 1. unguided web-based self-help for problematic drinking, 2. adherence-focused guided self-help, and 3. waiting list control. Self-report data will be collected at baseline (T1), 6 weeks (T2), and 6 months (T3) after randomization. The primary outcome will be the reduction of alcohol standard units during the 7 days prior to T2, using the Timeline Followback method. Cost-effectiveness analyses to determine direct and indirect costs will be conducted from the perspectives of employers and the society. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol.Discussion: There is a need to identify effective low-threshold solutions to improve ill-health and reduce the negative economic consequences due to problematic alcohol drinking in workforces. If the proposed web-based intervention proves both to be efficacious and cost-effective, it may be a useful tool to increase utilization rates of interventions for problematic drinking in occupational settings.","Boss, Leif; Lehr, Dirk; Berking, Matthias; Riper, Heleen; Schaub, Michael Patrick; Ebert, David Daniel",0,10.1186/s12889-015-2375-0,385
495,The Effects of a Stress Management Intervention in Elementary School Children,"Objective: This preliminary study tests the effectiveness of an elementary school-based stress management technique on anxiety symptoms and heart rate variability (HRV) in children. Methods: In this controlled prospective longitudinal study, children in third-grade classroom participated in a teacher-led daily 10-minute stress management intervention for 4 months. The control class teacher read from a children's book for 10 minutes daily. A standardized anxiety scale and HRV (using computer biofeedback program) were measured before the 4-month intervention, immediately after, and 1 year later. Results: The intervention class showed significant improvement from baseline to the immediate postintervention period in total anxiety (N = 14, F = 12.95, p = .002), with 1-year follow-up scores maintaining improvement (N = 13, F = 5.88, p = .025). The intervention class had small improvement in HRV using the biofeedback program in the immediate postintervention period, with significant improvement at 1-year follow-up (N = 13, F = 10.61, p = .005). The control class showed no improvements. Qualitatively, children reported that the intervention was helpful during stressful times at school and at home, even after the study period. Conclusion: An elementary school-based short daily stress management intervention can decrease symptoms of anxiety, and improve HRV, a measure of relaxation. Ultimately, these children found this skill continued to help them cope better with everyday stressors.","Bothe, DA; Grignon, JB; Olness, KN",0,10.1097/DBP.0000000000000016,386
496,Stress management for headaches in children and adolescents: A review and practical recommendations for health promotion programs and well-being,"Stress is considered to be the most common factor reported to trigger headaches in children and adolescents. Although tension-type headache and migraine are the two most common types of headache in children and adolescents, they are often untreated, ignoring their stressful background. We provide a narrative review of the available evidence for health-care professionals involved in stress-related headache management and health promotion programs. An integrative plan is delivered through lifestyle improvement and biopsychosocial modifying stress response techniques. Healthy dietary choices, sleep hygiene, and regular exercise, although limited, are effective for young sufferers. Biopsychosocial therapies such as relaxation, biofeedback, hypnosis, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapy, and acupuncture focus at stress physiological and behavioral relief. Our purpose is to suggest a stress-related headache management to empower children to make healthy choices in order to improve their lifelong well-being and quality of life.

498,Advances in the prevention and management of ventilator-associated pneumonia,"Purpose of reviewDespite copious literature on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), this subject remain controversial. We review the current state of the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VAP, paying special attention to data reported over the past year.Recent findingsThe latest recommendations for VAP prevention stress the importance of implementing ventilator bundles and VAP-specific process measures such as hand hygiene in healthcare workers and regular oral care with a chlorhexidine antiseptic in patients. Isolated interventions such as aspirating subglottic secretions or the use of silver-coated endotracheal tubes have also achieved a reduction in the incidence of VAP. Improvement should be confirmed by active surveillance.SummaryThere is still no consensus as to the best microbiological diagnostic method for VAP, although an early, rapid, and accurate diagnosis should be pursued. Most recent improvements include the direct antibiogram using E-test strips. There is much clinical assessment work pending before biomarkers and molecular techniques become routine practice. The best treatment strategy consists of immediate antimicrobial treatment deescalated later according to clinical progress and culture results. Emphasis is placed on the need for timely short treatment courses to avoid the emergence of resistance.","Bouza, Emilio; Burillo, Almudena",0,10.1097/QCO.0b013e32832d8910,389
499,Psychometric properties of the PTSD checklist for diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-fifth edition (PCL-5) in veterans,"This study examined the psychometric properties of the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition (PCL-5; Weathers, Litz, et al., 2013b) in 2 independent samples of veterans receiving care at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center (N = 468). A subsample of these participants (n = 140) was used to define a valid diagnostic cutoff score for the instrument using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5; Weathers, Blake, et al., 2013) as the reference standard. The PCL-5 test scores demonstrated good internal consistency (a =. 96), test-retest reliability (r =. 84), and convergent and discriminant validity. Consistent with previous studies (Armour et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014), confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the data were best explained by a 6-factor anhedonia model and a 7-factor hybrid model. Signal detection analyses using the CAPS-5 revealed that PCL-5 scores of 31 to 33 were optimally efficient for diagnosing PTSD (k(.5) =. 58). Overall, the findings suggest that the PCL-5 is a psychometrically sound instrument that can be used effectively with veterans. Further, by determining a valid cutoff score using the CAPS-5, the PCL-5 can now be used to identify veterans with probable PTSD. However, findings also suggest the need for research to evaluate cluster structure of DSM-5.

502,Subthreshold Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Meta-Analytic Review of DSM-IV Prevalence and a Proposed DSM-5 Approach to Measurement,"Subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic condition that is often ignored, the cumulative effects of which can negatively impact an individual's quality of life and overall health care costs. However, subthreshold PTSD prevalence rates and impairment remain unclear due to variations in research methodology. This study examined the existing literature in order to recommend approaches to standardize subthreshold PTSD assessment. We conducted (a) a meta-analysis of subthreshold PTSD prevalence rates and (b) compared functional impairment associated with the 3 most commonly studied subthreshold PTSD definitions. Meta-analytic results revealed that the average prevalence rate of subthreshold PTSD across studies was 14.7%, with a lower rate (12.6%) among the most methodologically rigorous studies and higher rate (15.6%) across less rigorous studies. There were significant methodological differences among reviewed studies with regard to definition, measurement, and population. Different definitions led to prevalence rates ranging between 13.7% and 16.4%. Variability in prevalence rates most related to population and sample composition, with trauma type and community (vs. epidemiological) samples significantly impacting heterogeneity. Qualitative information gathered from studies presenting functional correlates supported current evidence that psychological and behavioral parameters were worse among subthreshold PTSD groups compared with no-PTSD groups, but not as severe as impairment in PTSD groups. Several studies also reported significant increased risk of suicidality and hopelessness as well as higher health care utilization rates among those with subthreshold PTSD (compared with trauma exposed no-PTSD samples). Based on findings, we propose recommendations for developing a standard approach to evaluation of subthreshold PTSD.","Brancu M., Mann-Wrobel M., Beckham J.C., Wagner H.R., Elliott A., Robbins A.T., Wong M., Berchuck A.E., Runnals J.J.",0,10.1037/tra0000078,392

509,Continued Bullying Victimization from Childhood to Young Adulthood: a Longitudinal Study of Mediating and Protective Factors,"Bullying in schools has severe consequences for victimsâ€™ adjustment. It is unclear, however, whether victims of school bullying continue to be victimized in other contexts during adulthood. Mediating processes through which peer victimization in school increases the risk of revictimization in adulthood, as well as protective factors, also need to be explored. This study examined 1) the longitudinal association between peer victimization in school and victimization at work during young adulthood, 2) the predictive link of reactive and proactive aggression and anxious-withdrawn behavior in childhood with victimization in school and at the workplace, 3) the potential mediating role of depression symptoms, and 4) the potential protective effect of friendship support. The study included 251 participants (61% females) followed from age 12 to age 22. Participants reported about their victimization in school from ages 12 to 17 and their workplace victimization at age 22. They also reported about their depression-related thoughts and feelings and about friendship support. Teachers rated reactive and proactive aggression and anxiety-withdrawal at age 12. Structural equation modeling revealed that anxiety-withdrawal at age 12 predicted peer victimization in school, which in turn predicted later victimization at work. The latter association was partially mediated by increased depression symptoms. However, friendship support counteracted (via a main effect) the link between school victimization and subsequent depression symptoms. Bullying victims may benefit from interventions aimed at reducing depression symptoms and fostering social skills to establish supportive friendships to help avoid the generation of new interpersonal stress such as workplace victimization in adulthood.

This study tested the effects of a stress management intervention on indicators of anxiety, depression and self-efficacy in self-selected first year medical students. Forty two medical students volunteered to participate and provided informed consent. An eight session intervention was offered and focused on building relaxation skills, adaptive coping, and basic nutrition. Anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy were assessed pre and post intervention. This group of students had significantly higher baseline values of depression and anxiety but lower self-efficacy compared to a previous study of medical students at the same institution (p < 0.03). After the intervention, statistically significant improvements were observed in anxiety (p < 0.05), and self-efficacy (p < 0.05), but not in depression. The entering levels of anxiety and depression in this group suggested that these students were at risk for later clinical syndromes. Intervention directed to decreasing the effects of stress was associated with improvement in indicators of distress and may modify the longer term risk.","Brennan, J; McGrady, A; Lynch, DJ; Schaefer, P; Whearty, K",0,10.1007/s10484-016-9333-1,396

513,The Syndemic Illness of HIV and Trauma: Implications for a Trauma-Informed Model of Care,"Background: People living with HIV infection are disproportionately burdened by trauma and the resultant negative health consequences, making the combination of HIV infection and trauma a syndemic illness. Despite the high co-occurrence and negative influence on health, trauma and posttraumatic sequelae in people living with HIV infection often go unrecognized and untreated because of the current gaps in medical training and lack of practice guidelines. Objective: We set out to review the current literature on HIV infection and trauma and propose a trauma-informed model of care to target this syndemic illness. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane review databases for articles that contained the following search terms: HIV AND either trauma (specifically violent trauma), PTSD, intimate partner violence (IPV), abuse, or trauma-informed care. Articles were limited to primary clinical research or metanalyses published in English. Articles were excluded if they referred to HIV-associated posttraumatic stress disorder or HIV-associated posttraumatic growth. Results: We confirm high, but variable, rates of trauma in people living with HIV infection demonstrated in multiple studies, ranging from 10%-90%. Trauma is associated with (1) increased HIV-risk behavior, contributing to transmission and acquisition of the virus; (2) negative internal and external mediators also associated with poor health and high-risk HIV behavior (3) poor adherence to treatment; (4) poor HIV-related and other health outcomes; and (5) particularly vulnerable special populations. Conclusions: Clinicians should consider using a model of trauma-informed care in the treatment of people living with HIV infection. Its adoption in different settings needs to be matched to available resources.

515,"Tackling Stress Management, Addiction, and Suicide Prevention in a Predoctoral Dental Curriculum","Health care professionals, particularly dentists, are subject to high levels of stress. Without proper stress management, problems related to mental health and addiction and, to a lesser extent, deliberate self-harm such as suicide may arise. There is a lack of information on teaching methodologies employed to discuss stress management and suicide prevention in dental education. The purpose of this article is to describe a University of British Columbia Faculty of Dentistry module designed to address stress management and suicide prevention, using students' personal reflections to illustrate the impact of the pedagogies used. The module enrolls more than 200 students per year and has sessions tailored to the discussion of stress management and suicide prevention. The pedagogies include standardized patients, invited guest lectures, in-class activities, video presentation, and self-reflections. More than 500 students' self-reflections collected over the past five years illustrate the seriousness of the issues discussed and the level of discomfort students experience when pondering such issues. The instructors hope to have increased students' awareness of the stressors in their profession. Further studies are needed to unravel the extent to which such pedagogy influences a balanced practice of dentistry.","Brondani, MA; Ramanula, D; Pattanaporn, K",0,,399
516,Illness perception ratings of high-risk newborns by mothers and clinicians: Relationship to illness severity and maternal stress,"Objective: Patients' views of illness are often thought to differ from those of medical staff, although this is rarely assessed. This study examined the correspondence between mothers' and clinicians' perceptions of the same high-risk newborns, as well as with an objective measure of illness severity. We also investigated how mothers' perceptions were related to reported stress. Methods: Mothers of 99 high-risk infants admitted to either a neonatal intensive care or neonatal high dependency unit, which offers specialized but not intensive care, completed illness perception ratings of their baby's condition as well as perceived stress 3 to 5 days following admission. At the same time, a standardized measure of neonatal illness severity was calculated and the baby's primary neonatologist completed illness perceptions ratings. Results: Unlike clinician ratings, mothers' illness perceptions were not significantly correlated with illness severity. Mothers generally rated babies in both units as sicker and having a more serious illness than did neonatologists. Whereas clinicians, compared with mothers, rated babies in intensive care as having an illness that would affect their life more and last for a longer time. Mothers rated medical treatment to be significantly more helpful than did clinicians, particularly for babies admitted to the high dependency unit. Mothers' stress was significantly associated with illness perceptions but unrelated to illness severity. Conclusions: Significant differences exist in the perceptions of illness severity, helpfulness of treatment, and the long-term effects of the baby's illness between parents and clinicians and this may lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations in communication.

517,Social and occupational factors associated with psychological distress and disorder among disaster responders: A systematic review,"Background: When disasters occur, there are many different occupational groups involved in rescue, recovery and support efforts. This study aimed to conduct a systematic literature review to identify social and occupational factors affecting the psychological impact of disasters on responders. Methods: Four electronic literature databases (MEDLINEÂ®, Embase, PsycINFOÂ® and Web of Science) were searched and hand searches of reference lists were carried out. Papers were screened against specific inclusion criteria (e.g. published in peer-reviewed journal in English; included a quantitative measure of wellbeing; participants were disaster responders). Data was extracted from relevant papers and thematic analysis was used to develop a list of key factors affecting the wellbeing of disaster responders. Results: Eighteen thousand five papers were found and 111 included in the review. The psychological impact of disasters on responders appeared associated with pre-disaster factors (occupational factors; specialised training and preparedness; life events and health), during-disaster factors (exposure; duration on site and arrival time; emotional involvement; peri-traumatic distress/dissociation; role-related stressors; perceptions of safety, threat and risk; harm to self or close others; social support; professional support) and post-disaster factors (professional support; impact on life; life events; media; coping strategies). Conclusions: There are steps that can be taken at all stages of a disaster (before, during and after) which may minimise risks to responders and enhance resilience. Preparedness (for the demands of the role and the potential psychological impact) and support (particularly from the organisation) are essential. The findings of this review could potentially be used to develop training workshops for professionals involved in disaster response.

519,"Evidence-based clinical hypnosis for obstetrics, labor and delivery, and preterm labor","This paper reviews the benefits and effectiveness of hypnosis in obstetrics and labor and delivery, demonstrating significant reductions in the use of analgesics and anesthesia and in shorter Stages 1 and 2 labors. It presents empirical and theoretical rationales for use of hypnosis in preterm labor (PTL) and labor and delivery at term. The benefits of hypnosis in relation to labor length, pain levels, and the enjoyment of labor, as well as its effectiveness in preterm labor are noted in randomized controlled trials and in a meta-analysis. Risk factors are reported for preterm delivery; hypnosis significantly prolongs pregnancy. Six cases are presented of hypnosis stopping PTL a number of times and when indicated at term. A case report of successful use of hypnosis in quadruplets is presented with some scripts. Suggestions are made for further research.

521,The development of a computer-administered cognitive-behavioral intervention to promote stress management among HIV+ women,"Few interventions address the unique psychosocial needs of HIV+ women. To address this unmet need, we developed and pilot tested a brief, cognitive-behavioral computerized stress management intervention with 60 HIV+ women. This interactive intervention included modules that promoted cognitive appraisal skills, encouraged appropriate coping responses and problem solving skills, and provided relaxation training. In this report we provide an overview of the intervention and present acceptability and feasibility data from a pilot intervention trial. All participants successfully navigated the computerized program and most found the intervention to be acceptable. Overall, the results indicated that a brief, computerized stress management intervention was a feasible and acceptable approach to enhance stress management skills; use of this intervention has the potential to reduce distress and improve health outcomes among HIV+ women.

522,The Benefits of Being Present: Mindfulness and Its Role in Psychological Well-Being,"Mindfulness is an attribute of consciousness long believed to promote well-being. This research provides a theoretical and empirical examination of the role of mindfulness in psychological well-being. The development and psychometric properties of the dispositional Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) are described. Correlational, quasi-experimental, and laboratory studies then show that the MAAS measures a unique quality of consciousness that is related to a variety of well-being constructs, that differentiates mindfulness practitioners from others, and that is associated with enhanced self-awareness. An experience-sampling study shows that both dispositional and state mindfulness predict self-regulated behavior and positive emotional states. Finally, a clinical intervention study with cancer patients demonstrates that increases in mindfulness over time relate to declines in mood disturbance and stress.","Brown K.W., Ryan R.M.",0,10.1037/0022-3514.84.4.822,404
523,"A Pilot Study of a Distress Tolerance Treatment for Opiate-Dependent Patients Initiating Buprenorphine: Rationale, Methodology, and Outcomes","Buprenorphine, an opioid that is a long-acting partial opiate agonist, is an efficacious treatment for opiate dependence that is growing in popularity. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that many patients will lapse within the first week of treatment and that lapses are often associated with withdrawal-related or emotional distress. Recent research suggests that individualsâ€™ reactions to this distress may represent an important treatment target. In the current study, we describe the development and outcomes from a preliminary pilot evaluation (N = 5) of a novel distress tolerance (DT) treatment for individuals initiating buprenorphine. This treatment incorporates exposure-based and acceptance-based treatment approaches that we have previously applied to the treatment of tobacco dependence. Results from this pilot study establish the feasibility and acceptability of this approach. We are now conducting a randomized controlled trial of this treatment that we hope will yield clinically significant findings and offer clinicians an efficacious behavioral treatment to complement the effects of buprenorphine.

524,Distress tolerance and early smoking lapse,"A significant percentage of smokers attempting cessation lapse to smoking within a matter of days and very few of these individuals recover to achieve abstinence. Current models of relapse devote insufficient attention to this phenomenon of early smoking lapse. Furthermore, studies attempting to relate severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms to short-term smoking cessation outcomes have yielded equivocal results. The authors argue that how one reacts to the discomfort of nicotine withdrawal is a more promising avenue of investigation than severity of withdrawal and that inability to tolerate the distress of nicotine withdrawal and associated negative affect is a key factor in early smoking lapse and subsequent relapse. Theoretical and clinical implications of distress tolerance in smoking cessation are discussed and the development of a specialized and novel behavioral distress tolerance treatment for early smoking lapsers is proposed.","Brown R.A., Lejuez C.W., Kahler C.W., Strong D.R., Zvolensky M.J.",0,10.1016/j.cpr.2005.05.003,406
525,Effectiveness of a preventive coaching intervention for employees at risk for sickness absence due to psychosocial health complaints: Results of a randomized controlled trial,"Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a preventive coaching intervention on sickness absence due to psychosocial health complaints and on general well being of employees. Methods: Employees at risk for sickness absence were identified and randomized. The intervention group received the preventive coaching program; the control group received usual care. Primary outcome measure of the trial is sickness absence due to psychosocial health complaints; secondary outcome measures are related to general well being, such as psychological distress, fatigue, and coping. Results: No effect of coaching on self-reported sickness absence due to psychosocial health complaints was found. The intervention group reported statistically significant improved health, declined psychological distress, less burnout, less need for recovery, and an increased satisfaction with life. Conclusions: This study shows that the coaching intervention primarily has an effect on general well being of employees.","Duijts, Saskia F.

526,Annual Research Review: Breaking cycles of violence a systematic review and common practice elements analysis of psychosocial interventions for children and youth affected by armed conflict,"Background: Globally, one in 10 children live in regions affected by armed conflict. Children exposed to armed conflict are vulnerable to social and emotional difficulties, along with disrupted educational and occupational opportunities. Most armed conflicts occur in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), where mental health systems are limited and can be further weakened by the context of war. Research is needed to determine feasible and cost-effective psychosocial interventions that can be delivered safely by available mental health workforces (including nonspecialists). A vital first step toward achieving this is to examine evidence-based psychosocial interventions and identify the common therapeutic techniques being used across these treatments. Methods: A systematic review of psychosocial interventions for conflict-affected children and youth living in LMICs was performed. Studies were identified through database searches (PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PILOTS and Web of Science Core Collection), hand-searching of reference lists, and contacting expert researchers. The PracticeWise coding system was used to distill the practice elements within clinical protocols. Results: Twenty-eight randomized controlled trials and controlled trials conducted in conflict-affected settings, and 25 efficacious treatments were identified. Several practice elements were found across more than 50% of the intervention protocols of these treatments. These were access promotion, psychoeducation for children and parents, insight building, rapport building techniques, cognitive strategies, use of narratives, exposure techniques, and relapse prevention. Conclusions: Identification of the common practice elements of effective interventions for conflict-affected children and youth can inform essential future treatment development, implementation, and evaluation for this vulnerable population. To further advance the field, research should focus on identifying which of these elements are the active ingredients for clinical change, along with attention to costs of delivery, training, supervision and how to sustain quality implementation over time.","Brown, Felicity L.; de Graaff, Anne M.; Annan, Jeannie; Betancourt, Theresa S.",0,10.1111/jcpp.12671,408
528,Computerized stress management training for HIV+ women: A pilot intervention study,"HIV+women have unique psychosocial stressors, but few interventions have been designed for this population. To address this gap in the literature, we developed a brief, theory-guided, computer-administered, stress management intervention for HIV+women. To obtain initial evidence of the intervention's efficacy, we recruited 60 HIV+ female participants (70% African American) and randomized them to an immediate or delayed intervention condition. Psychological functioning, perceived stress, coping self-efficacy, and stress management knowledge were assessed at baseline and at a one month follow-up. Compared with the delayed treatment control group, women who received the intervention demonstrated improved stress management knowledge at the follow-up (pB0.01). However, depressive symptoms, psychological distress, perceived stress, and coping selfefficacy did not differ between the immediate and delayed intervention groups (ps>0.05). Computerized psychosocial interventions require continued refinement to meet the needs of HIV+ women.

529,A Randomized Trial of Wraparound Facilitation Versus Usual Child Protection Services,"Objective: To evaluate whether the addition of a wraparound facilitator to regular child protection services improved child and family functioning over 20 months. Method: A single blind randomized controlled trial with concealment and stratification across three sites (N = 135 eligible families with substantiated maltreatment).

No measurable benefit was associated with the intervention (e.g., child impairments, d =.14 [âˆ’.12,.52]). However, treatment fidelity analysis revealed that many components of wraparound were either missing or present in both groups.

530,"Posttraumatic stress disorder: Diagnosis and epidemiology, comorbidity and social consequences, biology and treatment","Epidemiological studies clearly indicate that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is becoming a major health concern worldwide even if still poorly recognized and not well treated. PTSD commonly co-occurs with other psychiatric disorders, and several symptoms overlap with major depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and substance abuse; this may contribute to diagnostic confusion and underdiagnosis. This anxiety disorder provokes significant occupational, psychiatric, medical and psychosocial disability, and its consequences are enormously costly, not only to the survivors and their families, but also to the health care system and society. Work impairment associated with PTSD is very similar to the amount of work impairment associated with major depression. The pathophysiology of PTSD is multifactorial and involves dysregulation of the serotonergic as well as the noradrenergic system. A rational therapeutic approach should normalize the specific psychobiological alterations associated with PTSD. This can be achieved through the use of antidepressant drugs, mainly of those that potentiate serotonergic mechanisms. Recent double-blind placebo-controlled studies report the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Several cognitive-behavioral and psychosocial treatments have also been reported to be efficacious and could be considered when treating PTSD patients. Copyright Â© 2001 S.

Participants were randomly assigned to either the dyadic intervention group (n = 37) or to a waiting list (assessment only) group (n = 37).Results: In an intent-to-treat analysis, a time-by-group interaction was found, whereby the treated participants had less PTSD symptoms at the post-treatment but not at the pre-treatment compared to controls. Controlling for the improvement observed in the control participants, the intervention yielded a net effect size of d = 0.39.Conclusions: A brief, early, and effective intervention can be provided by nurses or social workers in hospital settings, at a fairly low cost to individuals presenting to the emergency room as the result of trauma exposure.","Brunet, Alain; Des Groseilliers, Isabeau Bousquet; Cordova, Matthew J.; Ruzek, Josef I.",0,10.3402/ejpt.v4i0.21572,412

534,A review of acute stress disorder in DSM-5,"Acute stress disorder (ASD) was introduced into DSM-IV to describe acute stress reactions (ASRs) that occur in the initial month after exposure to a traumatic event and before the possibility of diagnosing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and to identify trauma survivors in the acute phase who are high risk for PTSD. This review considers ASD in relation to other diagnostic approaches to acute stress responses, critiques the evidence of the predictive power of ASD, and discusses ASD in relation to Adjustment Disorder. The evidence suggests that ASD does not adequately identify most people who develop PTSD. This review presents a number of options and preliminary considerations to be considered for DSM-5. It is proposed that ASD be limited to describing severe ASRs (that are not necessarily precursors of PTSD). The evidence suggests that the current emphasis on dissociation may be overly restrictive and does not recognize the heterogeneity of early posttraumatic stress responses. It is proposed that ASD may be better conceptualized as the severity of acute stress responses that does not require specific clusters to be present.

Methods A sample of 264 employees with elevated symptoms of perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS-10 â‰¥22) was randomly assigned either to the iSMI or a waitlist control (WLC) group with unrestricted access to treatment as usual. The iSMI consisted of seven sessions of problem-solving and emotion-regulation techniques and one booster session. Self-report data on symptoms of perceived stress and economic data were assessed at baseline, and at six months following randomization. A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) with symptom-free status as the main outcome from the employerâ€™s perspective was carried out. Statistical uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping (N=5000). Results The CBA yielded a net-benefit of â‚¬181 [95% confidence interval (CI) -6043â€“1042] per participant within the first six months following randomization. CEA showed that at a willingness-to-pay ceiling of â‚¬0, â‚¬1000, â‚¬2000 for one additional symptom free employee yielded a 67%, 90%, and 98% probability, respectively, of the intervention being cost-effective compared to the WLC.

536,Restoring depleted resources: Efficacy and mechanisms of change of an internet-based unguided recovery training for better sleep and psychological detachment from work,"Objective: This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of an Internet-based intervention, which aimed to improve recovery from work-related strain in teachers with sleeping problems and work-related rumination. In addition, mechanisms of change were also investigated. Methods: A sample of 128 teachers with elevated symptoms of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI] â‰¥ 15) and work-related rumination (Cognitive Irritation Scale â‰¥ 15) was assigned to either an Internet-based recovery training (intervention condition [IC]) or to a waitlist control condition (CC). The IC consisted of 6 Internet-based sessions that aimed to promote healthy restorative behavior. Self-report data were assessed at baseline and again after 8 weeks. Additionally, a sleep diary was used starting 1 week before baseline and ending 1 week after postassessment. The primary outcome was insomnia severity. Secondary outcomes included perseverative cognitions (i.e., work-related rumination and worrying), a range of recovery measures and depression. An extended 6-month follow-up was assessed in the IC only. A serial multiple mediator analysis was carried out to investigate mechanisms of change. Results: IC participants displayed a significantly greater reduction in insomnia severity (d = 1.37, 95% confidence interval: 0.99 -1.77) than did participants of the CC. The IC was also superior with regard to changes in all investigated secondary outcomes. Effects were maintained until a naturalistic 6-month follow-up. Effects on insomnia severity were mediated by both a reduction in perseverative cognitions and sleep effort. Additionally, a greater increase in number of recovery activities per week was found to be associated with lower perseverative cognitions that in turn led to a greater reduction in insomnia severity. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for the efficacy of an unguided, Internet-based occupational recovery training and provided first evidence for a number of assumed mechanisms of change.

The iSMI consisted of seven sessions and one booster session including problem-solving and emotion regulation techniques. Self-report data were assessed at baseline, at 7 weeks and at 6 months following randomisation. The primary outcome was perceived stress (PSS-10). The secondary outcomes included other relevant mental-related and work-related health outcomes. Data were analysed based on intention-to-treat principles.Results The iSMI participants showed a significantly higher reduction in perceived stress from baseline to post-treatment at 7 weeks (d=0.96, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.21) and to the 6-month follow-up (d=0.65, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.89) compared to the WLC.

539,Effectiveness of a brief behavioural intervention on psychological distress among women with a history of gender-based violence in urban Kenya: A randomised clinical trial,"BackgroundGender-based violence (GBV) represents a major cause of psychological morbidity worldwide, and particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Although there are effective treatments for common mental disorders associated with GBV, they typically require lengthy treatment programs that may limit scaling up in LMICs. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of a new 5-session behavioural treatment called Problem Management Plus (PM+) that lay community workers can be taught to deliver.Methods and findingsIn this single-blind, parallel, randomised controlled trial, adult women who had experienced GBV were identified through community screening for psychological distress and impaired functioning in Nairobi, Kenya. Participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio either to PM+ delivered in the community by lay community health workers provided with 8 days of training or to facility-based enhanced usual care (EUC) provided by community nurses. Participants were aware of treatment allocation, but research assessors were blinded. The primary outcome was psychological distress as measured by the total score on the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) assessed at 3 months after treatment. Secondary outcomes were impaired functioning (measured by the WHO Disability Adjustment Schedule [WHODAS]), symptoms of posttraumatic stress (measured by the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist [PCL]), personally identified problems (measured by Psychological Outcome Profiles [PSYCHLOPS]), stressful life events (measured by the Life Events Checklist [LEC]), and health service utilisation. Between 15 April 2015 and 20 August 2015, 1,393 women were screened for eligibility on the basis of psychological distress and impaired functioning. Of these, 518 women (37%) screened positive, of whom 421 (81%) were women who had experienced GBV. Of these 421 women, 209 were assigned to PM+ and 212 to EUC. Follow-up assessments were completed on 16 January 2016. The primary analysis was intention to treat and included 53 women in PM+ (25%) and 49 women in EUC (23%) lost to follow-up. The difference between PM+ and EUC in the change from baseline to 3 months on the GHQ-12 was 3.33 (95% CI 1.86-4.79, P = 0.001) in favour of PM+. In terms of secondary outcomes, for WHODAS the difference between PM+ and EUC in the change from baseline to 3-month follow-up was 1.96 (95% CI 0.21-3.71, P = 0.03), for PCL it was 3.95 (95% CI 0.06-7.83, P = 0.05), and for PSYCHLOPS it was 2.15 (95% CI 0.98-3.32, P = 0.001), all in favour of PM+. These estimated differences correspond to moderate effect sizes in favour of PM+ for GHQ-12 score (0.57, 95% CI 0.32-0.83) and PSYCHLOPS (0.67, 95% CI 0.31-1.03), and small effect sizes for WHODAS (0.26, 95% CI 0.02-0.50) and PCL (0.21, 95% CI 0.00-0.41). Twelve adverse events were reported, all of which were suicidal risks detected during screening. No adverse events were attributable to the interventions or the trial. Limitations of the study include no long-term follow-up, reliance on self-report rather than structured interview data, and lack of an attention control condition.ConclusionsAmong a community sample of women in urban Kenya with a history of GBV, a brief, lay-administered behavioural intervention, compared with EUC, resulted in moderate reductions in psychological distress at 3-month follow-up.Trial registrationAustralian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12614001291673 Copyright: CC BY 4.0","Bryant, Richard A; Schafer, Alison; Dawson, Katie S; Anjuri, Dorothy; Mulili, Caroline; Ndogoni, Lincoln; Koyiet, Phiona; Sijbrandij, Marit; Ulate, Jeannette; Shehadeh, Melissa Harper; Hadzi-Pavlovic, Dusan; Van Ommeren, Mark",0,,419
540,Impact of a Clinical Pharmacist Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis Management Program on Inappropriate Use in Hospitalized Patients,"Purpose Appropriate utilization of stress ulcer prophylaxis should be limited to high-risk, intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, inappropriate stress ulcer prophylaxis use among all hospitalized patients remains a concern. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and economic impact of a novel pharmacist-managed stress ulcer prophylaxis program in ICU and general ward patients. Methods This retrospective, pre- and poststudy design was conducted in adult ICU and general ward patients at a large academic medical center between January 1, 2011 and January 31, 2012 to compare the rates of inappropriate stress ulcer prophylaxis before and after the implementation of a pharmacist-led stress ulcer prophylaxis management program.

The relative reduction in the rate of inappropriate stress ulcer prophylaxis days after program implementation in ICU and general ward patients was 58.3% and 83.5%, respectively (P <.001). The rates of ICU patients inappropriately continued on stress ulcer prophylaxis upon hospital discharge in the pre- and postimplementation groups were 29.9% and 3.6%, respectively (P <.001), whereas general ward patients significantly decreased from 36.2% to 5.4% in the pre- and postimplementation groups, respectively (P <.001). Total inpatient costs associated with all stress ulcer prophylaxis administered was $20,052.70 in the pre- and $3280.49 in the postimplementation group (P <.001), resulting in an estimated cost savings of > $200,000 annually. No differences in clinical outcomes were observed. Conclusions The implementation of a pharmacist-managed stress ulcer prophylaxis program was associated with a decrease in inappropriate acid suppression rates during hospitalization and upon discharge, as well as significant cost savings.

541,The impact of an employee wellness programme in clothing/textile manufacturing companies: A randomised controlled trial,"Background: The prevalence of health risk behaviours is growing amongst South African employees. Health risk behaviours have been identified as a major contributor to reduced health related quality of life (HRQoL) and the increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases. Worksite wellness programmes promise to promote behaviour changes amongst employees and to improve their HRQoL. The aim of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of an employee wellness programme on HRQoL, health behaviour change, body mass index (BMI) and absenteeism amongst clothing and textile manufacturing employees. Methods. The study used a randomised control trial design. The sample consisted of 80 subjects from three clothing manufacturing companies in Cape Town, South Africa. The experimental group was subjected to a wellness programme based on the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) as well as weekly supervised exercise classes over six weeks. The control group received a once-off health promotion talk and various educational pamphlets, with no further intervention. Measurements were recorded at baseline and at six weeks post-intervention. Outcome measures included the EQ-5D, Stanford Exercise Behaviours Scale, body mass index and absenteeism.Data was analysed with the Statistica-8 software program. Non-parametric tests were used to evaluate the differences in the medians between the two groups and to determine the level of significance. The Sign test was used to determine the within group changes. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the difference between the two groups. Results: At six weeks post intervention the experimental group (39 subjects) demonstrated improvement in almost every parameter. In contrast, apart from an overall decrease in time off work and a reduction in BMI for all study participants, there was no significant change noted in the behaviour of the control group (41 subjects). Seventy percent of the experimental group had improved HRQoL EQ-5D VAS scores post intervention, indicating improved perceived HRQoL. In comparison, only 58% of the control group had improved HRQoL EQ-5D VAS scores post intervention. There was no significant difference between the two groups at baseline or at six weeks post intervention. Conclusion: An employee wellness programme based on the principles of CBT combined with weekly aerobic exercise class was beneficial in improving the perceived HRQoL and changing health-related behaviours of clothing manufacturing employees. However, it cannot be concluded that the EWP was more effective than the once off health promotion talk as no significant changes were noted between the two groups at 6-weeks post intervention.This trial has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (trial registration number NCT01625039).

542,Stochastic resonance training reduces musculoskeletal symptoms in metal manufacturing workers: A controlled preventive intervention study,"Objectives: This study examined the effects of stochastic resonance whole-body vibration training on work-related musculoskeletal symptoms and accidents.Participants: Participants were white and blue-collar employees of a Swiss metal manufacturer (N = 38), and participation was voluntary.Methods: The study was designed as a switching-replications longitudinal trial with randomized group allocation. The randomized controlled cross-over design consisted of two groups each given four weeks of exercise and no intervention during a second four-week period. Outcome was measured on a daily basis with questionnaires. Three components constituted musculoskeletal symptoms: musculoskeletal pain, related function limitations and musculoskeletal well-being. Accidents were assessed by ratings for balance and daily near-accidents. For statistical analysis, a mixed model was calculated.Results: At the end of the training period musculoskeletal pain and related function limitation were significantly reduced, whereas musculoskeletal well-being had significantly increased. For function limitation and musculoskeletal well-being, change over time was linear. There was no effect on balance or near-accidents.Conclusions: Stochastic resonance whole-body vibration was found to be effective in the prevention of work-related musculoskeletal symptoms. It is well suited for the use in a work environment since it requires very little effort in terms of infrastructure, time and investment from participants.","Burger, Christian; Schade, Volker; Lindner, Christina; Radlinger, Lorenz; Elfering, Achim",0,10.3233/WOR-2012-1350,422
543,Developing communication competency in the context of cancer: A critical interpretive analysis of provider training programs,"We conducted a critical interpretive analysis of 47 studies from the Cochrane Review of the communications training literature to capture the empirical indicators used to judge provider communication competency and to describe how the indicators were characterized in the context of a cancer care system. Of the 47 studies reviewed, few showed any resemblance to recommendations from two international consensus conferences of experts in the communication research field. Some of the challenges in moving forward with cancer-related communication skills involve deciding what we want people to learn, providing learning across various experiences, identifying learning models, and finding alternate ways of motivating people to learn. Once core competencies are clearly articulated, we can determine the best approaches for developing cancer-specific training programs.

544,Increasing oncologists' skills in eliciting and responding to emotional cues: Evaluation of a communication skills training program,"Purpose: Psychological morbidity in cancer patients is common, but often undetected and untreated. We developed a communication skills training (CST) program targeting this issue, and evaluated its impact on doctor behaviour. Patients and Methods: Thirty of 35 oncologists from six teaching hospitals in six Australian cities, participated. The CST was a 1.5-day intensive face-to-face workshop incorporating presentation of principles, a DVD modelling ideal behaviour and role-play practice, followed by four 1.5h monthly video-conferences incorporating role-play of doctor-generated scenarios. Doctors were randomized to receive the CST or not. Simulated patient interviews were videotaped and coded at baseline, after CST and 6 months later. Doctors completed questionnaires assessing stress and burnout at the same time points. Results: Doctors in the intervention group displayed more creating environment and fewer blocking behaviours at both follow-ups; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Intervention doctors valued the training highly, but did not report substantial reductions in stress and burnout. Conclusions: This short training programme demonstrated a positive effect on aspects of doctor behaviour. Video-conferencing after a short training course may be an effective strategy for delivering CST.

545,Conquer fear: protocol of a randomised controlled trial of a psychological intervention to reduce fear of cancer recurrence,"Background: Up to 70% of cancer survivors report clinically significant levels of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR). Despite the known negative impact of FCR on psychological wellbeing and quality of life, little research has investigated interventions for high FCR. Our team has developed and piloted a novel intervention (Conquer Fear) based on the Self-Regulatory Executive Function Model and Relational Frame Theory and is evaluating Conquer Fear in a randomised controlled trial (RCT). We aim to compare the efficacy and cost-efficacy of the Conquer Fear Intervention and relaxation training in reducing the impact of FCR.Methods/design: This study is a multi-centre RCT with 260 participants randomised either to the Conquer Fear Intervention or relaxation training. Both interventions will be delivered in five sessions over 10 weeks by trained psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers with five or more years experience in oncology. Conquer Fear sessions use attentional training, detached mindfulness, meta-cognitive therapy, values clarification and psycho-education to help patients change the way they regulate and respond to thoughts about cancer recurrence. Relaxation training includes training in progressive and passive muscle relaxation, meditative relaxation, visualisation and ""quick relaxation"" techniques. Relaxation was chosen to control for therapist time and attention and has good face-validity as an intervention. The primary outcome is fear of cancer recurrence. Secondary outcomes include distress, quality of life, unmet needs, and health care utilisation. Participants complete questionnaires prior to starting the intervention, immediately after completing the intervention, 3 and 6 months later. Eligible participants are early-stage breast or colorectal cancer survivors who have completed hospital-based treatment between 2 months and 5 years prior to study entry and report a score in the clinical range on the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory. The biostatistician is blinded to group allocation and participants are blinded to which intervention is being evaluated. Randomisation is computer generated, stratified by therapist, and uses sequentially numbered sealed envelopes.Discussion: If successful, the study will provide an evidence-based intervention to reduce psychological morbidity in cancer survivors, and reduce overall health care costs due to more appropriate use of follow-up care and other health services in this very large population.","Butow, Phyllis N.; Bell, Melanie L.; Smith, Allan B.; Fardell, Joanna E.; Thewes, Belinda; Turner, Jane; Gilchrist, Jemma; Beith, Jane; Girgis, Afaf; Sharpe, Louise; Shih, Sophy; Mihalopoulos, Cathrine",0,10.1186/1471-2407-13-201,425
546,Economic evaluation of a task-shifting intervention for common mental disorders in India,"Objective To carry out an economic evaluation of a task-shifting intervention for the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders in primary-care settings in Goa, India.Methods Cost utility and cost effectiveness analyses based on generalized linear models were performed within a trial set in 24 public and private primary-care facilities. Subjects were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control arm. Eligible subjects in the intervention arm were given psycho-education, case management, interpersonal psychotherapy and/or antidepressants by lay health workers. Subjects in the control arm were treated by physicians. The use of health-care resources, the disability of each subject and degree of psychiatric morbidity, as measured by the Revised Clinical Interview Schedule, were determined at 2, 6 and 12 months.Findings Complete data, from all three follow-ups, were collected from 1243 (75.4%) and 938 (81.7%) of the subjects enrolled in the study facilities from the public and private sectors, respectively. Within the public facilities, subjects in the intervention arm showed greater improvement in all the health outcomes investigated than those in the control arm. Time costs were also significantly lower in the intervention arm than in the control arm, whereas health system costs in the two arms were similar. Within the private facilities, however, the effectiveness and costs recorded in the two arms were similar.Conclusion Within public primary-care facilities in Goa, the use of lay health workers in the care of subjects with common mental disorders was not only cost effective but also cost-saving.","Buttorff, Christine; Hock, Rebecca S.; Weiss, Helen A.; Naik, Smita; Araya, Ricardo; Kirkwood, Betty R.; Chisholm, Daniel; Patel, Vikram",0,10.2471/BLT.12.104133,426
547,Social comparison processes and catastrophising in fibromyalgia: A path analysis,"Introduction: In addition to coping strategies, social comparison may play a role in illness adjustment. However, little is known about the role of contrast and identification in social comparison in adaptation to fibromyalgia. Aim: To evaluate through a path analysis in a sample of fibromyalgia patients, the association between identification and contrast in social comparison, catastrophising and specific health outcomes (fibromyalgia illness impact and psychological distress). Material and Method: 131 Spanish fibromyalgia outpatients (mean age: 50.15, SDÂ =Â 11.1) filled out a questionnaire. Results: We present a model that explained 33% of the variance in catastrophising by direct effects of more use of upward contrast and downward identification. In addition, 35% of fibromyalgia illness impact variance was explained by less upward identification, more upward contrast and more catastrophising and 42% of the variance in psychological distress by a direct effect of more use of upward contrast together with higher fibromyalgia illness impact. Discussion: We suggest that intervention programmes with chronic pain and fibromyalgia patients should focus on enhancing the use of upward identification in social comparison, and on minimising the use of upward contrast and downward identification in social comparison.

548,The effectiveness of job rotation to prevent work-related musculoskeletal disorders: protocol of a cluster randomized clinical trial,"Background: Job rotation has often been used in situations where the level of exposure cannot be reduced due to the characteristics of the job or through physical measures. However, the effectiveness of the job rotation strategy at preventing musculoskeletal complaints lacks adequate scientific data.Methods/Design: A cluster randomized controlled trial will be used to investigate the effectiveness of job rotation to prevent musculoskeletal disorders in industrial workers. The randomized cluster was based in characteristics of production sectors. A total cluster will be 4 sectors, and 957 workers will be recruited from a textile industry and randomly allocated into intervention or control groups. Both groups will receive training on ergonomics guidelines. In addition, the intervention group will perform job rotation, switching between tasks with low, moderate, and high risk for musculoskeletal complaints. The primary outcome will be the number of working hours lost due to sick leave by musculoskeletal injuries recorded in employee administrative data bases. Secondary outcomes measured via survey include: body parts with musculoskeletal pain, the intensity of this pain, physical workload, fatigue, general health status, physical activity level, and work productivity. Secondary outcome measures will be assessed at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed from the societal and company perspective.Discussion: Prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders is beneficial for workers, employers, and society. The results of this study will provide new information about the effectiveness of job rotation as a strategy to reduce work-related musculoskeletal disorders.","Caires Comper, Maria Luiza; Padula, Rosimeire Simprini",0,10.1186/1471-2474-15-170,428
549,Comparative effectiveness of an Internet-based smoking cessation intervention versus clinic-based specialty care for veterans,"Introduction The primary objective of this project was to examine the effectiveness of an Internet-based smoking cessation intervention combined with a tele-health medication clinic for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) compared to referral to clinic-based smoking cessation care. Methods A total of 413 patients were proactively recruited from the Durham VA Medical Center and followed for 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive either a referral to VA specialty smoking cessation care (control) or to the Internet intervention and tele-health medication clinic. Primary outcomes included (1) intervention reach, (2) self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates at 3 months and 12 months, and 3) relative cost-effectiveness. Results Reach of the Internet intervention and use of smoking cessation aids were significantly greater compared to the control. At 3 months-post randomization, however, there were no significant differences in quit rates: 17% (95% CI: 12%â€“23%) in the Internet-based intervention compared to 12% (95% CI: 8%â€“17%) in the control arm. Similarly, there were no differences in quit rates at 12 months (13% vs. 16%). While costs associated with the Internet arm were higher due to increased penetration and intensity of NRT use, there were no statistically significant differences in the relative cost effectiveness (e.g., life years gained, quality adjusted life years) between the two arms. Conclusions Current results suggest that using an electronic medical record to identify smokers and proactively offering smoking cessation services that are consistent with US Public Health Guidelines can significantly reduce smoking in veterans. Novel interventions that increase the reach of intensive treatment are needed to maximize quit rates in this population.

550,Alzheimer's disease multiple intervention trial (ADMIT): study protocol for a randomized controlled clinical trial,"Background: Given the current lack of disease-modifying therapies, it is important to explore new models of longitudinal care for older adults with dementia that focus on improving quality of life and delaying functional decline. In a previous clinical trial, we demonstrated that collaborative care for Alzheimer's disease reduces patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms as well as caregiver stress. However, these improvements in quality of life were not associated with delays in subjects' functional decline.Trial design: Parallel randomized controlled clinical trial with 1: 1 allocation.Participants: A total of 180 community-dwelling patients aged >= 45 years who are diagnosed with possible or probable Alzheimer's disease; subjects must also have a caregiver willing to participate in the study and be willing to accept home visits. Subjects and their caregivers are enrolled from the primary care and geriatric medicine practices of an urban public health system serving Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.Interventions: All patients receive best practices primary care including collaborative care by a dementia care manager over two years; this best practices primary care program represents the local adaptation and implementation of our prior collaborative care intervention in the urban public health system. Intervention patients also receive in-home occupational therapy delivered in twenty-four sessions over two years in addition to best practices primary care. The focus of the occupational therapy intervention is delaying functional decline and helping both subjects and caregivers adapt to functional impairments. The in-home sessions are tailored to the specific needs and goals of each patient-caregiver dyad; these needs are expected to change over the course of the study.Objective: To determine whether best practices primary care plus home-based occupational therapy delays functional decline among patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to subjects treated in the control group.Outcomes: The primary outcome is the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Studies Group Activities of Daily Living Scale; secondary outcome measures are two performance-based measures including the Short Physical Performance Battery and Short Portable Sarcopenia Measure. Outcome assessments for both the caregiver-reported scale and subjects' physical performance scales are completed in the subject's home.Randomization: Eligible patient-care giver dyads will be stratified by clinic type and block randomized with a computer developed randomization scheme using a 1:1 allocation ratio.Blinding: Single blinded. Research assistants completing the outcome assessments were blinded to the subjects' treatment group.","Callahan, Christopher M.; Boustani, Malaz A.; Schmid, Arlene A.; Austrom, Mary G.; Miller, Douglas K.; Gao, Sujuan; Morris, Carrie S.; Vogel, Mickey; Hendrie, Hugh C.",0,10.1186/1745-6215-13-92,430
551,The programming of individual differences in defensive responses and reproductive strategies in the rat through variations in maternal care,"There are profound maternal effects on individual differences in defensive responses and reproductive strategies in species ranging literally from plants to insects to birds. Maternal effects commonly reflect the quality of the environment and are most likely mediated by the quality of the maternal provision (egg, propagule, etc.), which in turn determines growth rates and adult phenotype. In this paper, we review data from the rat that suggest comparable forms of maternal effects on both defensive responses to threat and reproductive behavior and which are mediated by variations in maternal behavior. Ultimately, we will need to contend with the reality that neural development, function and health are defined by social and economic influences. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

552,Stress management in the workplace: A comparison of a computer-based and an in-person stress-management intervention,"Work stress contributes significantly to corporate health costs. Numerous corporations have implemented worksite stress-management interventions to mitigate the financial and personal impact of stress on their employees. Cognitive-behavioral stress-management interventions can reduce both perceived and physiologically measured stress. Traditionally, these interventions have been delivered in small, instructor-led groups. Outcomes from a stress-management intervention provided via an instructor led versus a computer-presented format were compared through a randomized, controlled design. Brief relaxation procedures presented in both formats led to highly significant reductions in immediately-reported stress. Stress reduction, however, was not associated with improvement in longer-term indices of workplace stress following completion of the intervention and at a one-month follow-up. Attrition was significantly higher in the computer-presentation format. Across both presentation formats, however, more frequent use of stress-reduction techniques was correlated significantly with greater reductions in stress indices (e.g., nervousness, social isolation, overall work stress) at follow-up.

553,Efficacy of interpersonal therapy-group format adapted to post-traumatic stress disorder: An open-label add-on trial,"Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent condition, yet available treatments demonstrate only modest efficacy. Exposure therapies, considered by many to be the ""gold-standard"" therapy for PTSD, are poorly tolerated by many patients and show high attrition. We evaluated interpersonal therapy, in a group format, adapted to PTSD (IPT-G PTSD), as an adjunctive treatment for patients who failed to respond to conventional psychopharmacological treatment. Methods: Research participants included 40 patients who sought treatment through a program on violence in the department of psychiatry of Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo (UNIFESP). They had received conventional psychopharmacological treatment for at least 12 weeks and failed to have an adequate clinical response. After signing an informed consent, approved earlier by the UNIFESP Ethics Review Board, they received a semistructured diagnostic interview (SCID-I), administered by a trained mental health worker, to confirm the presence of a PTSD diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria. Other instruments were administered, and patients completed out self-report instruments at baseline, and endpoint to evaluate clinical outcomes. Results: Thirty-three patients completed the trial, but all had at least one second outcome evaluation. There were significant improvements on all measures, with large effect sizes. Conclusions: IPT-G PTSD was effective not only in decreasing symptoms of PTSD, but also in decreasing symptoms of anxiety and depression. It led to significant improvements in social adjustment and quality of life. It was well tolerated and there were few dropouts. Our results are very preliminary; they need further confirmation through randomized controlled clinical trials.

556,Emotional disorders in primary care [Los desÃ³rdenes emocionales en atenciÃ³n primaria],"The analysis and systematic review of the scientific literature on emotional disorders, ED (anxiety disorders, mood disorders - major depressive disorder and dysthymia -, adjustment disorder with anxiety and/or depressed mood) reveals that: (1) there is an association between high levels of stress and negative emotionality (especially anxiety and depression) in these disorders; (2) two thirds of patients with mental disorders are attended in Primary Care (PC); (3) in this setting, patients with ED traditionally receive pharmacological treatment (only one third of the mental health treatment in Spain met minimal adequacy criteria); in spite of constituting the treatment of choice for ED, in the minority of cases are empirically validated psychological treatments put into practice; (4) patients with ED who receive treatment as usual show elevated attrition and relapse rates, a high risk of chronification and comorbidity with other mental disorders and/or chronic physical conditions, a more frequent use of PC services, and greater disability than patients with physical disorders, imposing high economic, social and psychological costs; (5) however, both the efficacy and efficiency increase when ED are treated in PC with psychological techniques that are based on scientific evidence; (6) Spain's public healthcare system is characterized by a sparse number of psychologists and excessive pharmaceutical costs. In addition to this, EDs are generating a continuous increase in psychoactive substance abuse (especially benzodiazepines), frequent attenders in PC settings, high economic costs, elevated healthcare workers' overload, reduction in the doctor/patient time, increasing as a result the risk of chronification of these disorders, when in fact there are highly efficacious and low cost treatment interventions. To help improve this situation, the Spanish Foundation for the Promotion and Development of Professional and Scientific Psychology (Psychofoundation) will conduct a pilot study in order to offer evidence-based psychological treatment to those patients presenting to PC with EDs. Psychofoundation will ensure the provision of necessary means and pertinent permits to enable the presence of two psychologists in each centre, in various PC centres, in different autonomous communities. These healthcare workers will be especially trained to apply efficacious psychological techniques in PC and carry out this work during 6 consecutive months. The selected PC centres will randomly assign both types of treatment (psychological and traditional), offering patients with ED in the experimental group the possibility of receiving psychological treatment, as an alternative or complement to the pharmacological treatment. The psychological intervention will be protocolized and described in a document to be handed out to the patient. The project's scientific aspects of efficacy, duration, chronification and costs will be assessed and results will be published in scientific journals with high impact factor.

557,Impact of stress testing before percutaneous coronary intervention or medical management on outcomes of patients with persistent total occlusion after myocardial infarction: Analysis from the occluded artery trial,"Background In the Occluded Artery Trial (OAT), 2,201 stable patients with an occluded infarct-related artery (IRA) were randomized to percutaneous caronary intervention (PCI) or optimal medical treatment alone (MED). There was no difference in the primary end point of death, reinfarction, or congestive heart failure (CHF). We examined the prognostic impact of prerandomization stress testing. Methods Stress testing was required by protocol except for patients with single-vessel disease and akinesis/dyskinesis of the infarct zone. The presence of severe inducible ischemia was an exclusion criterion for OAT. We compared outcomes based on performance and results of stress testing. Results Five hundred ninety-eight (27%) patients (297 PCI, 301 MED) underwent stress testing. Radionuclide imaging or stress echocardiography was performed in 40%. Patients who had stress testing were younger (57 vs 59 years); had higher ejection fractions (49% vs 47%); and had lower rates of death (7.8% vs 13.2%), class IV CHF (2.4% vs 5.5%), and the primary end point (13.9% vs 18.9%) than patients without stress testing (all P < .01). Mild-moderate ischemia was observed in 40% of patients with stress testing and was not related to outcomes. Among patients with inducible ischemia, outcomes were similar for PCI and MED (all P > .10). Conclusions In OAT, patients who underwent stress testing had better outcomes than patients who did not, likely related to differences in baseline characteristics. In patients managed with optimal medical therapy or PCI, mild-moderate inducible ischemia was not related to outcomes. The lack of benefit for PCI compared to MED alone was consistent regardless of whether stress testing was performed or inducible ischemia was present.

558,Social support and mastery influence the association between stress and poor physical health in parents caring for children with developmental disabilities,"To date, much of the research linking the stress of caring for children with developmental disabilities (e.g. Autism & Down syndrome) with parental health outcomes have tended to concentrate on mental health with less attention paid to the physical health consequences. Thus, this study sought to explore the psychosocial predictors of poor physical health in these caring parents. One hundred and sixty-seven parents (109 caregivers and 58 control parents) completed measures of stress, child problem behaviours, social support, mastery and physical health. Parents of children with developmental disabilities had poorer physical health compared to control parents. Stress and mastery, but not social support and problem behaviours, were significant predictors of poor physical health within caring parents for children with developmental disabilities. However, the association between mastery and physical health was mediated by perceived stress such that those parents who were higher on mastery reported less stress and better physical health; furthermore, the association between stress and physical health was moderated by social support; those parents high on social support and low in stress had better physical health. These results indicate that the paths between psychosocial factors and poor physical health in the caring parents are working synergistically rather than in isolation. They also underscore the importance of providing multi-component interventions that offer a variety of psychosocial resources to meet the precise needs of the parents.

Identifying fundamental transdiagnostic elements is a priority for clinical theory and practice. Historical criteria for identifying fundamental components of anxiety are described and revised criteria are offered. The revised criteria are based on logical rhetorical arguments using a constituent reductionist postpositivist approach supported by the available empirical data. The revised criteria are then used to assess several fears posited as fundamental, including fear of the unknown. The review and synthesis concludes with brief recommendations for future theoretical discourse as well as clinical and non-clinical research.

Methods: Cancer outpatients (n=122) applying for enrollment in a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program completed the MAAS and measures of mood disturbance and stress. Local community members (n=122) matched to the patients on gender, age, and education level completed the same measures. Results: The single-factor structure of the MAAS was invariant across the groups. Higher MAAS scores were associated with lower mood disturbance and stress symptoms in cancer patients, and the structure of these relations was invariant across groups. Conclusions: The MAAS appears to have appropriate application in research examining the role of mindfulness in the psychological well-being of cancer patients, with or without comparisons to nonclinical controls.

However, less is known about whether they share protective factors that reduce the risk for depressive symptoms and weight gain. The goal of the current study was to examine the role of stress and four protective factors (social support, self-esteem, physical activity, and sedentary behavior) as predictors of depressive symptoms and body mass index over time. Participating in the current study were 6504 (51.6Â % female; 60.7Â % European American, 22.5Â % African American, 11.4Â % Hispanic, 3.3Â % Asian American, and 2Â % other ethnicities) adolescents from the National Study of Adolescent and Adult Health. Participants were followed for three waves from adolescence to young adulthood (Wave I age rangeÂ =Â 12â€“18; Wave III age rangeÂ =Â 18â€“26). Data were analyzed using multi-level modeling and results showed that stressors significantly predicted trajectories of depressive symptoms and body mass index over time. Social support buffered the effects of stressors on BMI over time. Self-esteem influenced trajectories of both BMI and depressive symptoms. Differential effects were found for physical activity with physical activity predicting declines in depressive symptoms and sedentary behavior predicting declines in BMI over time. The current study suggests that stress is a common risk factor for depressive symptoms and weight gain, but that there is specificity in how the protective factors influence each type of outcome.

564,A Community-based Stress Management Program: Using Wearable Devices to Assess Whole Body Physiological Responses in Non-laboratory Settings,"A pragmatic breath-based intervention to benefit human performance and stress management is timely and valuable to individuals seeking holistic approaches for emotional regulation and optimizing compensatory reserve mechanisms. This protocol is designed to not only teach mind-body awareness but also to provide feedback utilizing physiological data and survey results. The primary findings of this study showed that heart coherence and alpha variables were significantly correlated after four weeks of the breath-based meditation stress protocol. Meditation and rhythmic breathing produced significant increases in alpha brain activity. These brain physiological responses conformed to the Pleth Variability Index (PVI) changes, suggesting the ability of the human body to enter into a meditative state and effectively manage stress. When assessed after four weeks of daily practicing the techniques employed in the stress management protocol, based on the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, subjects improved in applying mindfulness skills. The overall mindfulness score, Pleth variability index (PVI), and perfusion index (PI) increased after the 4-week intervention period. Results from electroencephalography (brain waves) were consistent with a meditative state during the post-study follow-up session. This provides evidence that wearable devices are feasible for data collection during a breath-based stress management intervention. This protocol can be easily and efficiently implemented into any study design in which physiological data are desired in a non-laboratory-based setting.","Carter, R; Carter, KS; Holliday, J; Holliday, A; Harrison, CK",0,10.3791/55816,440
565,Is it time for a population health approach to neck pain?,"Objective: Neck pain and its associated disorders (NPAD) cause significant health burden in the general Population and after road traffic and occupational injury. Individual-level health care treatments have been well studied, but population-health approaches to this problem have not. We used a best-evidence synthesis to examine population-level approaches to the prevention and control of NPAD.Methods: The systematic review examined studies published between 1980 and 2006 that addressed the incidence. prevalence, risk factors, prevention, cost, assessment and classification, interventions, and course and prognostic factors for NPAD. Citations were screened for relevance, scientifically reviewed, and synthesized. Valid studies addressing, public policies or population-level approaches to the prevention and control of NPAD were identified and used in the evidence synthesis.Results: Only 8 of the 552 scientifically admissible studies were considered relevant to a public or population health approach to preventing and controlling the burden of NPAD. For whiplash-associated disorders, active head restraints and scat backs were protective in rear-end collisions; insurance policies affected the incidence and recovery; government funding of Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs did not benefit recovery; and early intensive health care delayed recovery. in the workplace, 2 randomized trials failed to show any preventive effect for ergonomic interventions or physical training and stress management. One study documented the societal cost of neck pain.Conclusions: There is little evidence oil which to make public or population-level recommendations, despite the important public health burden and costs of NPAD. Population-level approaches to preventing and controlling NPAD should be investigated.","Cassidy, J. David; Cote, Pierre",0,10.1016/j.jmpt.2008.06.008,441
568,"Guided self-help as intervention for traumatic stress in parents of children with cancer: Conceptualization, intervention strategies, and a case study","Being a parent of a child diagnosed with cancer poses an enormous stressor. Indeed, several parents have difficulties adjusting to such a situation and react with symptoms of traumatic stress, depression, and reduced quality of life. However, there is little conceptual work on behavioral mechanisms that contribute to suboptimal adaptation in these parents. The authors present a conceptualization in which experiential avoidance and rumination are suggested to contribute to increased levels of traumatic stress and suboptimal adaption. Based on this conceptualization, a recently developed intervention for parents of children with cancer, in the form of guided self-help, is presented. Finally, the authors present a successful case study as an example of the application of this intervention. Clinical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.

569,Cluster-randomized Trial of Infant Nutrition Training for Caries Prevention,"The objective of this study was to estimate the caries impact of providing training in infant feeding guidelines to workers at Brazilian public primary care clinics. In a cluster-randomized controlled trial (n = 20 clinics), health care workers either were trained in guidelines for infant nutrition, stressing healthful complementary feeding, or were assigned to a usual practices' control, which allowed for maternal counseling at practitioner discretion. Training occurred once; the amount of counseling provided to mothers was not assessed. Eligible pregnant women were enrolled to follow health outcomes in their children. Early childhood caries (ECC) was measured at age three years (n = 458 children). The overall reductions in ECC (relative risk, 0.92; 95%CI, 0.75, 1.12) and severe ECC (RR, 0.87; 95%CI, 0.64, 1.19) were not statistically significant. There was a protective effect among mothers who remained exclusively at the same health center (S-ECC RR, 0.68; 95%CI, 0.47, 0.99) and among those naming the health center as their principal source of feeding advice (S-ECC RR, 0.53; 95%CI, 0.29, 0.97). Health care worker training did not yield a statistically significant reduction in caries overall, although caries was reduced among children of mothers more connected to their health centers (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00635453).","Chaffee, B.

573,Feasibility and effectiveness of a parenting programme for Mexican parents of children with acquired brain injury-Case report,"Background: Acquired brain injury (ABI) during childhood typically causes behaviour problems in the child and high levels of stress in the family. Objectives: (1) To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a parenting programme to: improve behaviour and self-regulation (SR) in Mexican children with ABI, enhance parenting skills, and decrease parental stress in parents of children with ABI; (2) to explore the impact of parent SR on child. Methods: Case study design with four participants post-ABI, aged 7â€“12Â years, recruited in Mexico City. A parenting programme (Signposts for Building Better Behaviour) was delivered and provided parents with strategies to manage child behaviour. Child behaviour, child self-regulation, parental stress and parenting practices were measured before, immediately post-intervention, and three months post-intervention. Results: At immediate and three months post-intervention improvements in parenting skills, reduction in parental stress, and improvement in child behaviour were identified. Conclusions: The programme is feasible in a Mexican population and was effective in improving parenting skills and reducing stress in parents of children with ABI, as well as improving child behaviour and behavioural SR. These domains continue improving three months after the intervention. The improvements in challenging behaviour at home did not transfer to the school environment.

575,Life Adaptation Skills Training (LAST) for persons with depression: A randomized controlled study,"Abstract Bakground To investigate the efficacy of the ""Life Adaptation Skills Training (LAST)"" program for persons with depression. Methods Sixty-eight subjects with depressive disorder were recruited from psychiatric outpatient clinics in Taipei city and were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (N=33), or a control group (N=35). The intervention group received 24-sessions of the LAST program, as well as phone contact mainly related to support for a total of 24 times. The control group only received phone contact 24 times. The primary outcome measure utilized was the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF-Taiwan version. Secondary outcome measures included the Occupational self-assessment, the Mastery scale, the Social support questionnaire, the Beck anxiety inventory, the Beck depression inventory-II, and the Beck scale for suicide ideation. The mixed-effects linear model was applied to analyze the incremental efficacy of the LAST program, and the partial eta squared (Î·p 2) was used to examine the within- and between- group effect size. Results The subjects who participated in the LAST program showed significant incremental improvements with moderate to large between-group effect sizes on their level of anxiety (-5.45Â±2.34, p<0.05; Î·p 2=0.083) and level of suicidal ideation (-3.09Â±1.11, p<0.01; Î·p 2=0.157) when compared to the control group. The reduction of suicidal ideations had a maintenance effect for three months after the end of intervention (-3.44Â±1.09, p<0.01), with moderate between-group effect sizes (Î·p 2=0.101). Both groups showed significant improvement on overall QOL, overall health, physical QOL, psychological QOL, level of anxiety, and level of depression. The within-group effect sizes achieved large effects in the intervention group (Î·p 2=0.328-0.544), and were larger than that of the control group. Limitations A small sample size in the study, a high dropout rate, lower compliance rates for the intervention group, and lacking of true control group. Conclusions The occupation-based LAST program, which focuses on lifestyle rearrangement and coping skills enhancement, could significantly improve the level of anxiety and suicidal ideations for persons with depression.

576,"The UP-TECH project, an intervention to support caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients in Italy: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","Background: The epidemic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a significant challenge for the health care and social service systems of many developed countries. AD affects both patients and family caregivers, on whom the main burden of care falls, putting them at higher risk of stress, anxiety, mortality and lower quality of life. Evidence remains controversial concerning the effectiveness of providing support to caregivers of AD patients, through case management, counseling, training, technological devices and the integration of existing care services. The main objectives of the UP-TECH project are: 1) to reduce the care burden of family caregivers of AD patients; and 2) to maintain AD patients at home.Methods/design: A total of 450 dyads comprising AD patients and their caregivers in five health districts of the Marche region, Italy, will be randomized into three study arms. Participants in the first study arm will receive comprehensive care and support from a case manager (an ad hoc trained social worker) (UP group). Subjects in the second study arm will be similarly supported by a case manager, but in addition will receive a technological toolkit (UP-TECH group). Participants in the control arm will only receive brochures regarding available services. All subjects will be visited at home by a trained nurse who will assess them using a standardized questionnaire at enrollment (M0), 6 months (M6) and 12 months (M12). Follow-up telephone interviews are scheduled at 24 months (M24). The primary outcomes are: 1) caregiver burden, measured using the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI); and 2) the actual number of days spent at home during the study period, defined as the number of days free from institutionalizations, hospitalizations and stays in an observation unit of an emergency room.Discussion: The UP-TECH project protocol integrates previous evidence on the effectiveness of strategies in dementia care, that is, the use of case management, new technologies, nurse home visits and efforts toward the integration of existing services in an ambitious holistic design. The analysis of different interventions is expected to provide sound evidence of the effectiveness and cost of programs supporting AD patients in the community.","Chiatti, Carlos; Masera, Filippo; Rimland, Joseph M.; Cherubini, Antonio; Scarpino, Osvaldo; Spazzafumo, Liana; Lattanzio, Fabrizia; Baldassarri, Diletta; Bitti, Luigina; Carosi, Aurora; Sabbatini, Maila; Paolasini, Elisabetta; Fiori, Tania; Fronzi, Cinzia; Giacchetta, Simona; Giacomini, Valeria; Giovagnoli, Laura; Lattanzi, Giuli; Manca, Anna Maria; Marinelli, Ida; Pigini, Valeria; Pignotti, Marina; Proietti, Maria Chiara; Quarticelli, Antonia; Rovedi, Martina; Tasso, Letizia; Valeri, Valentina; Antonioli, Andrea; Barabucci, Mariella; Bassani, Mara; Bollettini, Paola; Bruttapasta, M.

578,MyStudentBody-Stress: An online stress management intervention for college students,"College students who have high stress levels tend to experience an increased risk of academic difficulties, substance abuse, and emotional problems. To enhance student stress management and health promoting behaviors, an online stress management intervention called MyStudentBody-Stress (MyStudentBody-Stress) was developed and tested. College students at six U.S. colleges were randomized to one of three conditions: MyStudentBody-Stress, a control health information website, or no intervention. The differences between groups on stress control and health behavior measures were compared at baseline, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after baseline. Although there were no between-group differences on primary outcome variables, secondary analyses indicated that MyStudentBody-Stress participants were more likely to increase weekly physical activity, use specific stress management methods, and exhibit decreased anxiety and family problems. These findings indicate some potentially beneficial effects of online stress management programming for college students. Implications for college health practitioners are discussed.

579,Effect of a Primary Care-Based Psychological Intervention on Symptoms of Common Mental Disorders in Zimbabwe A Randomized Clinical Trial,"IMPORTANCE Depression and anxiety are common mental disorders globally but are rarely recognized or treated in low-income settings. Task-shifting of mental health care to lay health workers (LHWs) might decrease the treatment gap.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally adapted psychological intervention for common mental disorders delivered by LHWs in primary care.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cluster randomized clinical trial with 6 months' follow-up conducted from September 1, 2014, to May 25, 2015, in Harare, Zimbabwe. Twenty-four clinics were randomized 1: 1 to the intervention or enhanced usual care (control). Participants were clinic attenders 18 years or older who screened positive for common mental disorders on the locally validated Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ-14).INTERVENTIONS The Friendship Bench intervention comprised 6 sessions of individual problem-solving therapy delivered by trained, supervised LHWs plus an optional 6-session peer support program. The control group received standard care plus information, education, and support on common mental disorders.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was common mental disorder measured at 6 months as a continuous variable via the SSQ-14 score, with a range of 0 (best) to 14 and a cutpoint of 9. The secondary outcome was depression symptoms measured as a binary variable via the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, with a range of 0 (best) to 27 and a cutpoint of 11. Outcomes were analyzed by modified intention-to-treat.RESULTS Among 573 randomized patients (286 in the intervention group and 287 in the control group), 495 (86.4%) were women, median age was 33 years (interquartile range, 27-41 years), 238 (41.7%) were human immunodeficiency virus positive, and 521 (90.9%) completed follow-up at 6 months. Intervention group participants had fewer symptoms than control group participants on the SSQ-14 (3.81; 95% CI, 3.28 to 4.34 vs 8.90; 95% CI, 8.33 to 9.47; adjusted mean difference, -4.86; 95% CI, -5.63 to -4.10; P < .001; adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.29; P < .001). Intervention group participants also had lower risk of symptoms of depression (13.7% vs 49.9%; ARR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.34; P < .001).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among individuals screening positive for common mental disorders in Zimbabwe, LHW-administered, primary care-based problem-solving therapy with education and support compared with standard care plus education and support resulted in improved symptoms at 6 months.

580,Evaluating effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a group psychological intervention using cognitive behavioural strategies for women with common mental disorders in conflict-affected rural Pakistan: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Background: The impact of humanitarian disasters upon mental health is well recognised. The evidence for psychological interventions for mental health is mounting, but few interventions have been rigorously tested in humanitarian settings. To be sustainable in humanitarian settings interventions need to be short, simple, deliverable by nonspecialists under supervision, and adopt a transdiagnostic approach where an array of mental health outcomes are addressed simultaneously. These elements have been incorporated into the newly developed WHO Problem Management Plus (PM+) Group intervention. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the locally adapted PM+ Group intervention for women in Swat, Pakistan.Methods: This PM+ Group trial is a two-arm, single-blind, cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in a community-based setting with women in rural Pakistan. PM+ is delivered in partnership with the Lady Health Worker (LHW) Programme which provides community-based health care to women in Pakistan. Thirty-four LHW clusters will be randomised in a 1: 1 allocation ratio using a permuted-block randomisation method. Participants screened and found to meet the inclusion criteria will be allocated to either the PM+ intervention group (n = 306), or the control arm (n = 306). The manualised PM+ intervention involves five sessions, each lasting 3 h, and introduces four strategies applied by participants to problems that they are facing. It is delivered by local female facilitators with a minimum of 16 years of education who are provided with targeted training and supervision. The primary outcome is individual psychological distress, measured by levels of anxiety and depression on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at 20 weeks after baseline. Secondary outcomes include major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, levels of social support, levels of functioning, and economic effectiveness. Intervention acceptability will be explored through an embedded qualitative study.Discussion: The PM+ Group trial will provide important evidence on the effectiveness of an empirically supported psychological treatment delivered by nonspecialists in a humanitarian setting. If proven effective, the qualitative component will inform strategies for PM+ Group scale-up in health systems in other humanitarian settings.","Chiumento, Anna; Hamdani, Syed Usman; Khan, Muhammad Naseem; Dawson, Katie; Bryant, Richard A.; Sijbrandij, Marit; Nazir, Huma; Akhtar, Parveen; Masood, Aqsa; Wang, Duolao; van Ommeren, Mark; Rahman, Atif",0,10.1186/s13063-017-1905-8,450
581,Polymorphisms in oxidative stress-related genes are not associated with prostate cancer risk in heavy smokers,"Oxidative stress, associated with aging and inflammation, is likely to play a role in the etiology of prostate cancer. We evaluated potential associations between gene variants that result in reduced neutralization of reactive oxygen species (ROS; MnSOD Ala-16Val, CAT -262 C>T, and GPX1 Pro200Leu) and prostate cancer risk among 724 men with incident prostate cancer who participated in the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) cohort, a randomized trial for the prevention of lung cancer among men with a history of smoking and/or asbestos exposure. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated by logistic regression. Nested case-control analyses included study participants with available DNA (n = 533 cases and 1,470 controls), matched for race, age, and length of follow-time. Overall, there were no associations between genotypes of MnSOD, CAT, and GPX1 and prostate cancer risk, although among men diagnosed before age 65, CAT TT genotype was associated with increased risk (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.97-3.95). Further analyses stratified by factors related to environmental oxidative stress exposures did not modify associations. When calculating the number of risk alleles of MnSOD, CAT, and GPX1 hypothetically related to reduced protection against ROS, there was a nonsignificant relationship between prostate cancer and carriage of five or more risk alleles, in comparison to men with less than five risk alleles (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 0.90-4.42). In conclusion, it does not seem that variants in MnSOD, CAT, or GPX1 have an influence on prostate cancer risk in this cohort of men who were smokers or exposed to asbestos, although it is possible that cumulative defects in protection from oxidative stress may result in increased risk of the disease.","Choi, Ji-Yeob; Neuhouser, Marian L.; Barnett, Matt; Hudson, Matthew; Kristal, Alan R.; Thomquist, Mark; King, Irena B.; Goodman, Gary E.; Ambrosone, Christine B.",0,10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-0040,451
582,"Folic Acid, Vitamin B-6, and Vitamin B-12 in Combination and Age-Related Cataract in a Randomized Trial of Women","Purpose: To examine the incidence of cataract and cataract extraction in a trial of folic acid and vitamins B-6 and B-12.Methods: In a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial, 5442 female health professionals aged 40 years or older with preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) or three or more CVD risk factors were randomly assigned to receive a combination of folic acid (2.5 mg/day), vitamin B-6 (50 mg/day), and vitamin B-12 (1 mg/day), or placebo. A total of 3925 of these women did not have a diagnosis of cataract at baseline and were included in this analysis. The primary endpoint was age-related cataract, defined as an incident age-related lens opacity, responsible for a reduction in best-corrected visual acuity to 20/30 or worse, based on self-report confirmed by medical record review. Extraction of incident age-related cataract was a secondary endpoint of the trial.Results: During an average of 7.3 years of treatment and follow-up, 408 cataracts and 275 cataract extractions were documented. There were 215 cataracts in the combination treatment group and 193 in the placebo group (hazard ratio, HR, 1.10, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.90-1.33; p = 0.36). For the secondary endpoint of cataract extraction, there were 155 in the combination treatment group and 120 in the placebo group (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01-1.63; p = 0.04).Conclusions: In this large-scale randomized trial of women at high risk of CVD, daily supplementation with a combination of folic acid, vitamin B-6, and vitamin B-12 had no significant effect on cataract, but may have increased the risk of cataract extraction.","Christen, William G.; Glynn, Robert J.; Chew, Emily Y.; Albert, Christine M.; Manson, JoAnn E.",0,10.3109/09286586.2015.1130845,452
583,Perceptions of the long-term influence of mindfulness training on counselors and psychotherapists: A qualitative inquiry,"Although self-care is often touted as being important to counselors and psychotherapists, historically little has been done within graduate school to provide future therapists with self-care strategies. This article proposes that mindfulness training offers a promising approach to therapist self-care and introduces qualitative research on the long-term impact of mindfulness training to substantiate this claim. Sixteen former students who are now practicing counselors were interviewed. Thirteen of them reported continuing to practice mindfulness techniques. Participants indicated that mindfulness continued to influence both their personal lives and self-care practices leading to positive influences in physical, emotional, cognitive, and interpersonal well-being. In their professional lives, participants described ways of incorporating mindfulness into their way of being a therapist, their interventions, and how they conceptualize their clients' issues.

585,The meaning of social support for persons with serious mental illness,"Objective: This study sought to better understand the population-specific types of social support relevant to adults living with serious mental illness (SMI). Our study was exploratory and used a qualitative approach that centered on uncovering the types of social support meaningful and relevant to persons with SMI. Method: The sample comprised of 52 adults receiving county mental health services in the San Francisco Bay Area. Data was gathered from 6 focus groups and analyzed using NVivo10 and Consensual Qualitative Research (CQR; Hill et al., 2005; Hill et al., 1997). Results: Six qualitative domains were identified: (a) supportive conditions, (b) day-to-day living, (c) illness management, (d) resources and information, (e) guidance and advice, and (f) community participation support. Discussion: While the 6 support domains share some broad-based conceptual underpinnings with traditional models of emotional and instrumental support, the domains emerging from our study represent supports uniquely tied to the stressors associated with living with SMI, and therefore hold conceptual distinction from traditional types of support. Conclusions/Implications: Findings from this study offer a conceptual framework for understanding social support for persons living with SMI and lay the groundwork for the development of a SMI-specific measure of social support. In addition, our research permits future researchers to investigate the conditions under which social support buffers the impact of SMI stressors, assisting service providers in more effective identification of individual support needs for clinical intervention.

586,The value of stress-management interventions in life-threatening medical conditions,"Emotional stress has been associated with the development and progression of several chronic medical conditions. Recently, researchers have assessed the impact of stress-management interventions on patients' psychological functioning, quality of life, and various disease outcomes, including survival. This review summarizes the value of stress-management techniques in the treatment of two important, life-threatening conditions; coronary heart disease and cancer. Results from randomized clinical trials indicate that psychological interventions can improve patients' psychological functioning and quality of life.

This study aims to establish whether CR is a clinically effective and cost-effective intervention for people with early-stage dementia and their carers.Methods/design: In this multi-centre, single-blind randomised controlled trial, 480 people with early-stage dementia, each with a carer, will be randomised to receive either treatment as usual or cognitive rehabilitation (10 therapy sessions over 3 months, followed by 4 maintenance sessions over 6 months). We will compare the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation with that of treatment as usual with regard to improving self-reported and carer-rated goal performance in areas identified as causing concern by people with early-stage dementia; improving quality of life, self-efficacy, mood and cognition of people with early-stage dementia; and reducing stress levels and ameliorating quality of life for carers of participants with early-stage dementia. The incremental cost-effectiveness of goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation compared to treatment as usual will also be examined.Discussion: If the study confirms the benefits and cost-effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation, it will be important to examine how the goal-oriented cognitive rehabilitation approach can most effectively be integrated into routine health-care provision. Our aim is to provide training and develop materials to support the implementation of this approach following trial completion.","Clare, Linda; Bayer, Antony; Burns, Alistair; Corbett, Anne; Jones, Roy; Knapp, Martin; Kopelman, Michael; Kudlicka, Aleksandra; Leroi, Iracema; Oyebode, Jan; Pool, Jackie; Woods, Bob; Whitaker, Rhiannon",0,10.1186/1745-6215-14-152,456
589,"Well Elderly 2, Los Angeles, California, 2004-2008","Older people are at risk for health decline and loss of independence. Lifestyle interventions offer potential for reducing such negative outcomes. The Well Elderly study attempts to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a preventive lifestyle-based occupational therapy intervention, administered in a variety of community-based sites, in improving mental and physical well-being and cognitive functioning in ethnically diverse older people. Participants included 460 men and women aged 60 - 95 years recruited from 21 sites in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. For six months elders in one group received the Well Elderly Intervention, while elders in the other group remained untreated for the first six months and received the intervention during the second six-month phase. Following receipt of the intervention, subjects in both groups remained untreated for respective twelve month spans. The manualized intervention consisted of small group and individual sessions led by a licensed occupational therapist. Typically, each group had six to eight members, all recruited from the same site and treated by the same intervener. Monthly community outings were scheduled to facilitate direct experience with intervention content such as the use of public transportation. An assessment battery (including questionnaires, cognitive tests, and biomarker samples) measured potential mediating variables as well as outcome variables and was administered at study baseline and at subsequent six-month intervals. In addition, at baseline a set of background and control variables were measured. At the end of each assessment session (questionnaires and cognitive tests), subjects provided salivary samples. The Samples were assayed for cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and alpha amylase. Assessment of health-related quality of life, life satisfaction, and depression was based on self-rated questionnaires. Cognitive tests were conducted individually. Perceived physical health and aspects of mental well-being were measured, as were depressive symptoms, and life satisfaction. Variable categories include, health survey, stressful events, feelings, connections, attitudes, supports, beliefs, issues, activities, and demographics i.e. respondents age, sex, race, education level, employment, and income. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a preventive lifestyle-based occupational therapy intervention, administered in a variety of community-based sites, in improving mental and physical well-being and cognitive functioning in ethnically diverse older people. Older people are at risk for health decline and loss of independence. Lifestyle interventions offer potential for reducing such negative outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a preventive lifestyle-based occupational therapy intervention, administered in a variety of community-based sites, in improving mental and physical well-being and cognitive functioning in ethnically diverse older people. A randomized controlled trial was conducted comparing an occupational therapy intervention and a no-treatment control condition over a six-month experimental phase. Participants included 460 men and women aged 60 - 95 years recruited from 21 sites in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. For the first six months of their participation, elders in Group A received the Well Elderly Intervention. Elders in Group B remained untreated for the first six months and received the intervention during the second six-month phase. Following receipt of the intervention, subjects in both groups remained untreated for respective twelve-month spans. The manualized intervention consisted of small group and individual sessions led by a licensed occupational therapist. Typically, each group had six to eight members, all recruited from the same site and treated by the same intervener. Monthly community outings were scheduled to facilitate direct experience with intervention content such as the use of public transportation. Due to the overt nature of lifestyle programs, neither the therapists nor the treated participants were blind to the intervention. However, the interveners and participants were blind to the study design and hypotheses. An assessment battery (including questionnaires, cognitive tests, and biomarker samples) measured potential mediating variables as well as outcome variables and was administered at study baseline and at subsequent six-month intervals. In addition, at baseline a set of background and control variables were measured. At the end of each assessment session (questionnaires and cognitive tests), subjects were given vials for salivary samples and instructions on how to complete and store the samples at home. Subjects provided four samples on the following day (at rising, 30 minutes after rising, before lunch, before dinner) and stored them in their home freezers. These samples were picked up by a tester and transported on ice to the USC Health Sciences Campus the following day. Samples were shipped to Salimetrics in accordance with Centers for Disease Control guidelines. Upon arrival at Salimetrics, samples were stored at -80 degrees Celsius in a locked freezer until assay. Prior to testing, all samples were exposed to only a single freeze thaw cycle. Samples were assayed for cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, and alpha amylase. Assessment of health-related quality of life, life satisfaction and depression was based on self-rated questionnaires and was overseen by trained testers who were blind to the participants' condition assignments. The cognitive tests were conducted individually, in a private area adjacent to the main testing room. Norm-based scores on Version 2 of the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36v2) were used to measure perceived physical health and aspects of mental well-being. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale20 was used to assess depressive symptoms. Life satisfaction was measured by the Life Satisfaction Index-Z (LSI-Z). Three cognitive outcome variables (immediate recall, delayed recall and recognition) were measured by the word list procedure developed by the Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer's Disease. Selective attention was measured by median reaction time on a widely used computer-based visual search task. Psychomotor speed, was assessed by the Digit Symbol Substitution Task of the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale. Variable categories included: Health Survey; Stressful Events; Feelings; Connections; Attitudes; Supports; Beliefs; Issues; Activities; and Demographics which asked the respondents age, sex, race, education level, employment, and income.","Clark, Florence",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR33641,457
590,A regular yoga intervention for staff nurse sleep quality and work stress: a randomised controlled trial,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Although many studies have assessed the efficacy of yoga in older individuals, minimal research has focused on how nurses use yoga to improve sleep quality and to reduce work stress after work hours. We used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index in Chinese and the Questionnaire on Medical Worker's Stress in Chinese to determine the impact of yoga on the quality of sleep and work stress of staff nurses employed by a general hospital in China.BACKGROUND: Disturbances in the circadian rhythm interrupt an individual's pattern of sleep.STUDY DESIGN: Convenient sampling method.METHODS: One hundred and twenty nurses were randomised into two groups: a yoga group and a non-yoga group. The yoga group performed yoga more than two times every week for 50-60 minutes each time after work hours. The NG group did not participate in yoga. After six months, self-reported sleep quality and work stress were compared between the two groups, and then we used linear regression to confirm the independent factors related to sleep quality.RESULTS: Nurses in the yoga group had better sleep quality and lower work stress compared with nurses in the non-yoga group. The linear regression model indicated that nursing experience, age and yoga intervention were significantly related to sleep quality.CONCLUSION: Regular yoga can improve sleep quality and reduce work stress in staff nurses.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study provides evidence that hospital management should pay attention to nurse sleep quality and work stress, thereby taking corresponding measures to reduce work pressure and improve health outcomes.

591,Predictors of psychological distress among postnatal mothers in rural Nepal: A cross-sectional community-based study,"Background Perinatal common mental disorders are a major cause of disability among women and have consequences for children's growth and development. We aimed to identify factors associated with psychological distress, a proxy for common mental disorders, among mothers in rural Dhanusha, Nepal. Methods We used data from 9078 mothers who were screened for distress using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) around six weeks after delivery. We assessed the association between GHQ-12 score and socioeconomic, gender-based, cultural and reproductive health factors using a hierarchical analytical framework and multilevel linear regression models. Results Using a threshold GHQ-12 score of â‰¥6 to indicate caseness, the prevalence of distress was 9.8% (886/9078). Factors that predicted distress were severe food insecurity (Î² 2.21 (95% confidence interval 1.43, 3.40)), having a multiple birth (2.28 (1.27, 4.10)), caesarean section (1.70 (0.29, 2.24)), perinatal health problems (1.58 (1.23, 2.02)), no schooling (1.37 (1.08, 1.73)), fewer assets (1.33 (1.10, 1.60)), five or more children (1.33 (1.09, 1.61)), poor or no antenatal care (1.31 (1.15, 1.48) p<0.001), having never had a son (1.31 (1.14, 1.49)), not staying in the parental home in the postnatal period (1.15 (1.02, 1.30)), having a husband with no schooling (1.17 (0.96, 1.43)) and lower maternal age (0.99 (0.97, 1.00)). Limitations The study was cross-sectional and we were therefore unable to infer causality. Because data were not collected for some established predictors, including infant death, domestic violence and history of mental illness, we could not assess their associations with distress. Conclusions Socioeconomic disadvantage, gender inequality and poor reproductive health predict distress among mothers in Dhanusha. Maternal and child health programmes, as well as poverty-alleviation and educational interventions, may be beneficial for maternal mental health.

We conducted an interim analysis on the efficacy of a simulator-based occupational therapy driving intervention (OT-DI) compared with traffic safety education (TSE) in a randomized controlled trial. During baseline and post-testing, OT-Driver Rehabilitation Specialists and one OT-Certified Driver Rehabilitation Specialist measured driving performance errors on a DriveSafety CDS-250 high-fidelity simulator. The intervention group (n = 13) received three OT-DI sessions addressing driving errors and visual-search retraining. The control group (n = 13) received three TSE sessions addressing personal factors and defensive driving. Based on Wilcoxon rank-sum analysis, the OT-DI group's errors were significantly reduced when comparing baseline with Post-Test I (p < .0001) and comparing the OT-DI group with the TSE group at Post-Test I (p = .01). These findings provide support for the efficacy of the OT-DI and set the stage for a future effectiveness study.","Classen, Sherrilene; Winter, Sandra; Monahan, Miriam; Yarney, Abraham; Lutz, Amanda Link; Platek, Kyle; Levy, Charles",0,10.1177/1539449216675582,460

594,"The role of caregiver social support, depressed mood, and perceived stress in changes in pediatric secondhand Smoke Exposure and Asthma functional morbidity following an asthma exacerbation","Objective: Caregiver depressed mood and stress are associated with increased child asthma functional morbidity (AFM) and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe), whereas social support (SS) reduces risk. This study extends previous literature by examining (1) longitudinal patterns of pediatric AFM and SHSe and (2) how caregiver stress, depressed mood, and SS are related to child SHSe and AFM changes. Method: Participants were 334 caregivers who smoked, had a child with asthma, and were enrolled in a smoking cessation induction/asthma intervention. SHSe and AFM were measured at baseline and 4, 6, and 12 months. All measures were caregiver self-report. We used an autoregressive latent trajectory model to examine the intercept, linear, and quadratic growth factors and autoregressive and cross-lagged effects of SHSe and AFM. Results: After an asthma exacerbation, decreases in child AFM and SHSe were followed by respective increases over time. Child SHSe at 4 months and 6 months predicted subsequent child AFM. Autoregressive paths were significant for only AFM. Higher baseline caregiver depressed mood and stress predicted higher baseline child AFM but not other growth factors. Higher baseline caregiver self-esteem SS was associated with only lower baseline child AFM and fewer increases in AFM across time. Exploratory analyses indicated higher baseline caregiver depressed mood and stress were associated with less-favorable changes in child SHSe and AFM. Conclusions: Caregiver depressed mood, stress, and SS should be considered when addressing pediatric SHSe and AFM. Caregiver support may be needed to maintain intervention gains.

596,Treatment of complex PTSD: Results of the ISTSS expert clinician survey on best practices,"This study provides a summary of the results of an expert opinion survey initiated by the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies Complex Trauma Task Force regarding best practices for the treatment of complex posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Ratings from a mail-in survey from 25 complex PTSD experts and 25 classic PTSD experts regarding the most appropriate treatment approaches and interventions for complex PTSD were examined for areas of consensus and disagreement. Experts agreed on several aspects of treatment, with 84% endorsing a phase-based or sequenced therapy as the most appropriate treatment approach with interventions tailored to specific symptom sets. First-line interventions matched to specific symptoms included emotion regulation strategies, narration of trauma memory, cognitive restructuring, anxiety and stress management, and interpersonal skills. Meditation and mindfulness interventions were frequently identified as an effective second-line approach for emotional, attentional, and behavioral (e.g., aggression) disturbances. Agreement was not obtained on either the expected course of improvement or on duration of treatment. The survey results provide a strong rationale for conducting research focusing on the relative merits of traditional trauma-focused therapies and sequenced multicomponent approaches applied to different patient populations with a range of symptom profiles. Sustained symptom monitoring during the course of treatment and during extended follow-up would advance knowledge about both the speed and durability of treatment effects..

598,Ancillary Benefits for Caregivers of Children with Asthma Participating in an Environmental Intervention Study to Alleviate Asthma Symptoms,"Providing care for children with asthma can be demanding and time-intensive with far-reaching effects on caregivers' lives. Studies have documented childhood asthma symptom reductions and improved asthma-related quality of life (AQOL) with indoor allergen-reducing environmental interventions. Few such studies, however, have considered ancillary benefits to caregivers or other family members. Ancillary benefits could be derived from child health improvements and reduced caregiving burden or from factors such as improved living environments or social support that often accompanies intensive residential intervention efforts. As part of the Boston Healthy Public Housing Initiative (HPHI), a longitudinal single-cohort intervention study of asthmatic children, we examined trends in caregivers' quality of life related to their child's asthma (caregiver AQOL) using monthly Juniper Caregiver Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaires (AQLQ) for 32 primary caregivers to 42 asthmatic children aged 4 to 17 years. Longitudinal analyses were used to examine caregiver AQOL trends and their relationship to the child's AQOL, then to consider additional predictors of caregiver AQOL. Caregiver AQLQ improved significantly over the course of the study with overall improvements significantly correlated with child AQOL (p = 0.005). However, caregiver AQOL improved most in the months before environmental interventions, while children's AQOL improved most in the months following. Time trends in caregiver AQOL, controlling for child AQOL, were not explained by available social support or caregiver stress measures. Our findings suggest potential participation effects not adequately captured by standard measures. Future environmental intervention studies should more formally consider social support and participation effects for both children and caregivers.","Clougherty, Jane E.; Kubzansky, Laura D.; Spengler, John D.; Levy, Jonathan I.",0,10.1007/s11524-008-9341-4,465
599,Reducing child abuse amongst adolescents in low- and middle-income countries: A pre-post trial in South Africa.,"BACKGROUND: No known studies have tested the effectiveness of child abuse prevention programmes for adolescents in low- or middle-income countries. 'Parenting for Lifelong Health' ( http://tiny.cc/whoPLH ) is a collaborative project to develop and rigorously test abuse-prevention parenting programmes for free use in low-resource contexts. Research aims of this first pre-post trial in South Africa were: i) to identify indicative effects of the programme on child abuse and related outcomes; ii) to investigate programme safety for testing in a future randomised trial, and iii) to identify potential adaptations.METHODS: Two hundred thirty participants (adolescents and their primary caregivers) were recruited from schools, welfare services and community-sampling in rural, high-poverty South Africa (no exclusion criteria). All participated in a 12-week parenting programme, implemented by local NGO childcare workers to ensure real-world external validity. Standardised pre-post measures with adolescents and caregivers were used, and paired t-tests were conducted for primary outcomes: abuse (physical, emotional abuse and neglect), adolescent behaviour problems and parenting (positive and involved parenting, poor monitoring and inconsistent discipline), and secondary outcomes: mental health, social support and substance use.RESULTS: Participants reported high levels of socio-economic deprivation, e.g. 60% of adolescents had either an HIV-positive caregiver or were orphaned by AIDS, and 50% of caregivers experienced intimate partner violence. i) indicative effects: Primary outcomes comparing pre-test and post-test assessments showed reductions reported by adolescents and caregivers in child abuse (adolescent report 63.0% pre-test to 29.5% post-test, caregiver report 75.5% pre-test to 36.5% post-test, both p<0.001) poor monitoring/inconsistent discipline (p<.001), adolescent delinquency/aggressive behaviour (both p<.001), and improvements in positive/involved parenting (p<.01 adolescent report, p<.001 caregiver report). Secondary outcomes showed improved social support (p<.001 adolescent and caregiver reports), reduced parental and adolescent depression (both p<.001), parenting stress (p<.001 caregiver report) and caregiver substance use (p<.002 caregiver report). There were no changes in adolescent substance use. No negative effects were detected. ii) Programme acceptability and attendance was high. There was unanticipated programme diffusion within some study villages, with families initiating parenting groups in churches, and diffusion through school assemblies and religious sermons. iii) potential adaptations identified included the need to strengthen components on adolescent substance use and to consider how to support spontaneous programme diffusion with fidelity.CONCLUSIONS: The programme showed no signs of harm and initial evidence of reductions in child abuse and improved caregiver and adolescent outcomes. It showed high acceptability and unexpected community-level diffusion. Findings indicate needs for adaptations, and suitability for the next research step of more rigorous testing in randomised trials, using cluster randomization to allow for diffusion effects.","Cluver, Lucie; Meinck, Franziska; Yakubovich, Alexa; Doubt, Jenny; Redfern, Alice; Ward, Catherine; Salah, Nasteha; De Stone, Sachin; Petersen, Tshiamo; Mpimpilashe, Phelisa; Romero, Rocio Herrero; Ncobo, Lulu; Lachman, Jamie; Tsoanyane, Sibongile; Shenderovich, Yulia; Loening, Heidi; Byrne, Jasmina; Sherr, Lorraine; Kaplan, Lauren; Gardner, Frances",0,,466
601,Role and treatment of early maladaptive schemas in vietnam veterans with ptsd,"The role of early maladaptive schemas in understanding and treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was investigated. The fi rst study examined the role of perceived adverse parenting and early maladaptive schemas in the development of PTSD in Australian and New Zealand Vietnam war veterans (n = 220). Veterans diagnosed with PTSD scored higher on the Young Schema Questionnaire (L3) and had higher scores on the Measure of Parental Style than veterans not diagnosed with PTSD. The results suggest that early maladaptive schemas have an important role in the development or maintenance of PTSD in Vietnam veterans. The second study measured at baseline, termination and 3 months the early maladaptive schemas, PTSD, anxiety and depression of war veterans (n = 54) participating in a PTSD group treatment programme that included schema-focused therapy. Scores on the PTSD Checklist, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and 17 schemas decreased signifi cantly after treatment. Change scores for the schema treatment were compared with change scores of war veterans (n = 127) who had completed a manualized cognitive-behavioural therapy programme without schemafocused therapy. Pre-treatment measures were similar in both groups. Nevertheless, PTSD and anxiety improved more signifi cantly for the schema-focused therapy group. Together, these fi ndings support the feasibility of schema-focused therapy to assist veterans with PTSD.

Little is known about how providers' vaccination behaviors affect coverage rates. The purpose of this study was to identify provider behaviors that served as barriers to vaccination that could lead to missed opportunities to vaccinate. We conducted a study of health-care providers' vaccination behaviors during clinic visits for children <3 years of age. Information on provider behaviors was collected through parent report and direct observation. Compared with illness visits, parents were eight times more likely to report vaccination status was verified (p < 0.001) and three times more likely to report receiving counseling on immunization (p = 0.022) during vaccination visits. Training of all vaccination practitioners should focus on behaviors such as the necessity of verifying vaccination status regardless of visit type, stressing the importance of counseling parents on immunization and emphasizing what is a valid contraindication to vaccination.","Cohen, Megan A.; Gargano, Lisa M.; Thacker, Naveen; Choudhury, Panna; Weiss, Paul S.; Arora, Manisha; Orenstein, Walter A.; Omer, Saad B.; Hughes, James M.",0,10.1093/tropej/fmv023,468
603,Psychological resilience training in the Australian defence force,"The Australian Department of Defence (ADF) is currently confronted with modern-day veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, who have been exposed to risks that may result in the development of mental health problems. In an attempt to mitigate the development of such problems in ADF personnel, psychological resilience has become an area of increasing interest. Psychological resilience in the military context is defined as the ""sum total of psychological processes that permit individuals to maintain or return to previous levels of well-being and functioning in response to adversity""1. The develop-ment of psychological resilience training within the ADF begins with the theoretical and empirical foundations of psychological resilience. At the corner stone of psychological resilience training in the ADF is the stress and coping model (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984), and arousal and emotional regulation techniques. Resilience training based on these elements has been incorporated into ADF training programs in an effort to bolster each individual's inner resources and strengths as a preventive measure to enhance future adjustment. The psychological resilience training program within the ADF is known as BattleSMART (Self Management and Resilience Training). This chapter will describe how the ADF is capitalising on the construct of psychological resilience in an effort to prevent psychological distress in its members.

604,Interventions for musculoskeletal disorders in computer-intense office work: A framework for evaluation,"Workplace interventions for work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are usually multifaceted. These interventions tend to deal with multiple work organizational and physical risk factors and have components occurring at different organizational levels. The organizations are often changing, with shifting initiatives and priorities. Evaluation of such interventions poses challenges in documentation of implementation, reduction in exposures, and assessment of improved health outcomes. We describe a means-outcomes framework for evaluating field interventions that includes strategies, activities, objectives and metrics for outcomes using quantitative and qualitative methods. We demonstrate application of the framework to our work with a large newspaper, which builds on existing laboratory, aetiological and best practice evidence to improve musculoskeletal health. The newspaper had adopted several organizational strategies aimed at improving financial performance, including restructuring into teams, a major set of moves/renovations and introduction of new software. Concomitant WMSD-related organizational strategies include an ergonomics policy, human resources activities, promotion of team work, changes in environment and equipment specifications and development of information systems. We have found the framework useful for focusing the purpose of data collection and ensuring coverage of important components. At the same time, it provides sufficient flexibility to respond to the changing process of implementation.","Cole D.C., Wells R.P., Beaton D., Ferrier S., Hogg-Johnson S., Kennedy C., Lee H., Manno M., Moore A., Polanyi M., Shannon H., Subrata P., Swift M., Van Eerd D.",0,10.1080/02678370210137751,470

In this community-based project, we assessed the feasibility and acceptability of providing support groups to women with breast cancer in a large rural area using videoconferencing and a workbook journal, and we assessed the intervention's potential to reduce distress and increase emotional expression and self-efficacy for coping with cancer. Twenty-seven women in the Intermountain Region of northeastern California participated in eight-session support groups led by an oncology social worker by going to nearby videoconferencing sites. Feasibility and acceptability were demonstrated. Older as well as younger women were comfortable using videoconferencing and said the groups were valuable because they promoted information sharing and emotional bonds with other women with breast cancer. They emphasized the importance of a professional facilitator and identified advantages of using videoeonferencing for support groups. Pretest and posttest comparisons showed significant decreases in depression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The results suggest that the intervention has the potential to provide a valuable service that is not readily available in rural communities.

613,Impact of a meaning-centered intervention on job satisfaction and on quality of life among palliative care nurses,"Objective: Palliative care (PC) nurses experience several recurrent organizational, professional, and individual challenges. To address existential and emotional demands, the meaning-centered intervention was recently developed. The intervention applied didactic and process-oriented strategies, including guided reflections, experiential exercises, and education based on themes of Viktor Frankl's logotherapy. The objective of this study was to test its efficiency to improve job satisfaction and quality of life in PC nurses from three regional districts in Quebec Province, Canada. Methods: A randomized waiting-list group design was conducted, intervention group (n556) versus waiting-list group (n553). Job satisfaction, perception of benefits of working in PC, and spiritual and emotional quality of life were measured at pre-, posttest, and 3-month follow-up. Results: The PC nurses in the experimental group reported more perceived benefits of working in PC after the intervention and at follow-up. Spiritual and emotional quality of life remained, however, unaffected by the intervention. Conclusions: To explain null findings, theoretical and methodological challenges, related to existential interventions, such as choice of outcomes, and selection bias (participants recruited were healthy workers) are discussed. Future directions and strategies to deal with those issues are proposed.

Nursing assistants: General health as measured by feelings of stress, stress reactions, feeling of competence and illness.Results Positive effects in favour of the integrated emotion-oriented care were found in mild to moderately demented residents on two adaptive tasks: maintaining an emotional balance (less anxiety) and preserving a positive self-image (less dissatisfaction). In the trained group of nursing assistants fewer stress reactions were found only in those who perceived improvement in their emotion-oriented care skills after training.Conclusion Emotion-oriented care is more effective with regard to the emotional adaptation in nursing homes of persons with a mild to moderate dementia. For the severely demented elderly we did not find this surplus value. This outcome is of clinical importance for elderly persons with dementia who are cared for in nursing homes. With respect to the nursing assistants it is concluded that emotion-oriented care has a positive influence on stress reactions in some of them.

617,Structural Determinants of Client Perpetrated Violence Among Female Sex Workers in Two Mexico-U.S. Border Cities,"Female sex workers (FSWs) are disproportionately affected by both HIV and gender-based violence, such as that perpetrated by clients (CPV). We used a structural determinants framework to assess correlates of physical or sexual CPV in the past 6Â months among FSWs in the Mexico/U.S. border cities of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez and Tijuana. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis identified individual, client, interpersonal, work environment and macrostructural factors associated with recent CPV. Among 496 FSWs, 5Â % experienced recent CPV. Witnessing violence towards other FSWs in oneâ€™s neighborhood (aOR 5.6, 95Â % CI 1.8â€“17.2), having a majority of foreign (aOR 3.5, 95Â % CI 1.4â€“8.4) or substance using (aOR 4.0, 95Â % CI 1.5â€“10.4) clients, and being a street worker (aOR 3.0, 95Â % CI 1.1â€“7.7) were independently associated with recent CPV. Our findings underscore the vulnerability of FSWs and the need to design policies and interventions addressing macro-level influences on CPV rather than exclusively targeting individual behaviors.

619,The moderating role of dysphoria in the relationship between intrusions and alcohol use,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is frequently comorbid with alcohol use disorders (AUD; Calabrese et al., 2011; McFall, Mackay, & Donovan, 1992). Among several explanations for this comorbidity, the most empirically supported is the self-medication theory which postulates that substances are used to medicate PTSD-related distress (Keane & Wolfe, 1990; Khantzian, 1985; Stewart, 1996). The current study examines the effects of trauma-related distress on alcohol use (total drinking days, drinks per drinking day, heavy drinking days) in a sample of 127 trauma-exposed Veterans following deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan. The dysphoria symptoms of PTSD were used as an indicator of distress, and examined as a moderator in the relationship between intrusion symptoms of PTSD and alcohol use. The proposed moderation model was tested using cross-sectional data from the first month following return from deployment, and at 6 months and at 12 months post-deployment. Results showed that dysphoria symptoms significantly moderated relations between intrusions and total drinking days and heavy drinking days at one month post-deployment; however, a significant pattern was not demonstrated at 6 months and 12 months. Further, dysphoria did not moderate the relation between intrusion symptoms and drinks per drinking day at the three time points. Theoretical and clinical implications are subsequently discussed.

620,Responses of a sample of practicing psychologists to questions about clinical work with trauma and interest in specialized training,"This study reports on selected findings from a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association Practice Organization, which assessed the number of hours per month that practicing psychologists estimated they spent treating trauma survivors and their interest in additional clinical training on trauma-related issues and topics. Respondents reported 14.3 mean number of hours spent working with trauma survivors over the past month. Of the 76 of the sample who treated any trauma patients, the mean was 16.9 hours. Although trauma psychology is not currently an integral component of the standard curricula in graduate-level education, generalist psychology practitioners are treating trauma-related concerns in their clinical practices. It is imperative therefore to ascertain if they are adequately trained in specialized trauma recognition, assessment, and treatment. The fact that almost 64 of survey respondents expressed interest in participating in educational endeavors to learn more about trauma-related clinical topics suggests that such a need exists and that more training opportunities, including ongoing continuing education offerings, should be organized.

622,Worksite stress management training: Moderated effects and clinical significance,"Psychologically healthy participants may dilute the observed effects of worksite stress management training (SMT) programs, therefore hiding the true effectiveness of these interventions for more distressed workers. To examine this issue, 311 local government employees were randomly assigned to SMT based on acceptance and commitment therapy (SMT, n = 177) or to a waitlist control group (n = 134). The SMT program consisted of three half-day training sessions, and imparted a mixture of mindfulness and values-based action skills. Across a 6-month assessment period, SMT resulted in a significant reduction in employee distress. As predicted, the impact of SMT was significantly moderated by baseline distress, such that meaningful effects were found only among a subgroup of initially distressed workers. Furthermore, a majority (69%) of these initially distressed SMT participants improved to a clinically significant degree. The study highlights the importance of accounting for sample heterogeneity when evaluating and classifying worksite SMT programs.

623,A randomised worksite comparison of acceptance and commitment therapy and stress inoculation training,"In this comparative intervention study, 107 working individuals with above average levels of distress were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT; n = 37); stress inoculation training (SIT; n = 37); or a waitlist control group (n = 33). The interventions were delivered to small groups in the workplace via two half-day training sessions. ACT and SIT were found to be equally effective in reducing psychological distress across a three month assessment period. Mediation analysis indicated that the beneficial impact of ACT on mental health resulted from an increase in psychological flexibility rather than from a change in dysfunctional cognitive content. Contrary to hypothesis, a reduction in dysfunctional cognitions did not mediate change in the SIT condition. Results suggest that the worksite may offer a useful, yet underutilised, arena for testing cognitive-behavioural theories of change.

624,Functional analysis-based interventions for challenging behaviour in dementia,"BackgroundFunctional analysis (FA) for the management of challenging behaviour is a promising behavioural intervention that involves exploring the meaning or purpose of an individual's behaviour. It extends the 'ABC' approach of behavioural analysis, to overcome the restriction of having to derive a single explanatory hypothesis for the person's behaviour. It is seen as a first line alternative to traditional pharmacological management for agitation and aggression. FA typically requires the therapist to develop and evaluate hypotheses-driven strategies that aid family and staff caregivers to reduce or resolve a person's distress and its associated behavioural manifestations.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of functional analysis-based interventions for people with dementia (and their caregivers) living in their own home or in other settings.Search methodsWe searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 3 March 2011 using the terms: FA, behaviour (intervention, management, modification), BPSD, psychosocial and Dementia.Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) with reported behavioural outcomes that could be associated with functional analysis for the management of challenging behaviour in dementia.Data collection and analysisFour reviewers selected trials for inclusion. Two reviewers worked independently to extract data and assess trial quality, including bias. Meta-analyses for reported incidence, frequency, severity of care recipient challenging behaviour and mood (primary outcomes) and caregiver reaction, burden and mood were performed. Details of adverse effects were noted.Main resultsEighteen trials are included in the review. The majority were in family care settings. For fourteen studies, FA was just one aspect of a broad multi-component programme of care. Assessing the effect of FA was compromised by ill-defined protocols for the duration of component parts of these programmes (i.e. frequency of the intervention or actual time spent). Therefore, establishing the real effect of the FA component was not possible.Overall, positive effects were noted at post-intervention for the frequency of reported challenging behaviour (but not for incidence or severity) and for caregiver reaction (but not burden or depression). These effects were not seen at follow-up.Authors' conclusionsThe delivery of FA has been incorporated within wide ranging multi-component programmes and study designs have varied according to setting - i.e. family care, care homes and hospital, with surprisingly few studies located in care homes. Our findings suggest potential beneficial effects of multi-component interventions, which utilise FA. Whilst functional analysis for challenging behaviour in dementia care shows promise, it is too early to draw conclusions about its efficacy.","Cook, Esme D.

625,Initial Outcomes of a Mental Illness Self-Management Program Based on Wellness Recovery Action Planning,"Objective: This study examined changes in psychosocial outcomes among participants in an eight-week, peer-led, mental illness self-management intervention called Wellness Recovery Action Planning (WRAP). Methods: Eighty individuals with serious mental illness at five Ohio sites completed telephone interviews at baseline and one month after the intervention. Results: Paired t tests of pre- and postintervention scores revealed significant improvement in self-reported symptoms, recovery, hopefulness, self-advocacy, and physical health; empowerment decreased significantly and no significant changes were observed in social support. Those attending six or more sessions showed greater improvement than those attending fewer sessions. Conclusions: These promising early results suggest that further research on this intervention is warranted. Confirmation of the efficacy and effectiveness of peer-led self-management has the potential to enhance self-determination and promote recovery for people with psychiatric disabilities.

628,A Web-Based Health Promotion Program for Older Workers: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Recent evidence supports the efficacy of programs that promote improvements in the health practices of workers 50 years and older who are at higher risk for chronic diseases than younger workers are. Internet-based programs that promote healthy practices have also shown promise and, therefore, should be especially appropriate for workers aged 50 years and older.Objective: The purpose of the research was to evaluate the effectiveness of HealthyPast50, a fully automated Web-based health promotion program based on social cognitive theory and aimed specifically at workers 50 years and older.Methods: The randomized controlled trial was conducted across multiple US offices of a large global information technology company. The sample included 278 employees aged 50 to 68 who were recruited online and randomly assigned to the Web-based HealthyPast50 program or to a wait-list control condition. Self-report measures of diet, physical activity, stress, and tobacco use were collected online before and 3 months after the program group was given access to the program. Use data included number of log-ins and number of pages accessed. The primary analysis was multiple linear regression, following intent-to-treat principles with multiple imputation using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for nonmonotone missing data. Potential moderators from demographic characteristics and program dosage effects were assessed using multiple linear regression models. Additional analyses were conducted on complete (nonimputed) cases, excluding program participants who used the program for less than 30 minutes.Results: Retention rates were good for both groups: 80.4% (111/138) for the program group and 94.3% (132/140) for the control group. Program group participants spent a mean of 102.26 minutes in the program (SD 148.32), logged in a mean of 4.33 times (SD 4.28), and viewed a mean of 11.04 pages (SD 20.08). In the analysis of the imputed dataset, the program group performed significantly better than the control group on diet behavioral change self-efficacy (estimated adjusted difference [Delta]=0.16, P=.048), planning healthy eating (Delta=0.17, P=.03), and mild exercise (Delta=1.03, P=.01). Moderator and dosage analyses of the dataset found no significant program effects. Analyses of the nonimputed dataset comparing program users with controls found additional significant program effects on eating practices (Delta=0.09, P=.03), exercise self-efficacy (Delta=0.12, P=.03), exercise planning (Delta=0.18, P=.03), and aging beliefs (Delta=0.17, P=.01). Moderator analysis of this dataset also found significant moderator effects of gender on multiple measures of exercise.Conclusions: A Web-based health promotion program showed promise for making a significant contribution to the short-term dietary and exercise practices of older working adults. Gender effects suggest that the program effects on exercise are due mainly to improvements among women.","Cook, Royer F.; Hersch, Rebekah K.; Schlossberg, Dana; Leaf, Samantha L.",0,10.2196/jmir.3399,482
629,Implementing an acceptance and commitment therapy group protocol with veterans using VA's stepped care model of pain management,"The purpose of the current study was to replicate and extend previous findings; further demonstrating the effectiveness of an ACT outpatient, group-based treatment for Veterans who suffer from mixed idiopathic, chronic, non-cancer pain. This course of treatment utilized the VA's Stepped Care Model of Pain Management as a framework. A sample of 50 Veterans who participated in an ACT for chronic pain group intervention was evaluated after completing a pain health education program at a Midwestern VA Medical Center between February 16, 2010 and November 9, 2010. All participants completed a standard set of pre- and post-intervention measures. Paired-samples t tests were conducted to evaluate the impact of the manualized intervention on Veterans' scores. The current study found a significant difference in measures of pain interference, illness-focused coping, and global distress upon completion of the intervention. Findings suggest that ACT is an effective treatment for Veterans with chronic pain as a secondary consultative service.","Cosio, David; Schafer, Tracy",0,10.1007/s10865-015-9647-0,483
631,Examining the association between social cognition and functioning in individuals at ultra-high risk for psychosis,"Objective: Social and role functioning are compromised for the majority of individuals at ultra-high risk of psychosis, and it is important to identify factors that contribute to this functional decline. This study aimed to investigate social cognitive abilities, which have previously been linked to functioning in schizophrenia, as potential factors that impact social, role and global functioning in ultra-high risk patients.Method: A total of 30 ultra-high risk patients were recruited from an established at-risk clinical service in Melbourne, Australia, and completed a battery of social cognitive, neurocognitive, clinical and functioning measures. We examined the relationships between all four core domains of social cognition (emotion recognition, theory of mind, social perception and attributional style), neurocognitive, clinical and demographic variables with three measures of functioning (the Global Functioning Social and Role scales and the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale) using correlational and multiple regression analyses.Results: Performance on a visual theory of mind task (visual jokes task) was significantly correlated with both concurrent role (r=0.425, p=0.019) and global functioning (r=0.540, p=0.002). In multivariate analyses, it also accounted for unique variance in global, but not role functioning after adjusting for negative symptoms and stress. Social functioning was not associated with performance on any of the social cognition tasks.Conclusion: Among specific social cognitive abilities, only a test of theory of mind was associated with functioning in our ultra-high risk sample. Further longitudinal research is needed to examine the impact of social cognitive deficits on long-term functional outcome in the ultra-high risk group. Identifying social cognitive abilities that significantly impact functioning is important to inform the development of targeted intervention programmes for ultra-high risk individuals.","Cotter, Jack; Bartholomeusz, Cali; Papas, Alicia; Allott, Kelly; Nelson, Barnaby; Yung, Alison R.; Thompson, Andrew",0,10.1177/0004867415622691,484

A diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and heat illness was ultimately made, both of which could have been prevented through employing simple measures not utilised in this case. The dual pathology of her presentation was atypical for either disease meaning EVD could not be immediately excluded. She remained isolated in the red zone until 72h from symptom onset. This case highlights why force protection measures are important to reduce the incidence of both malaria and heat illness in deployed military and civilian populations. These prevention measures are particularly pertinent during the current EVD epidemic where presenting with these pathologies requires clinical assessment in the red zone' of an Ebola treatment unit.","Cox, Andrew T.; Schoonbaert, I.; Trinick, T.; Phillips, A.; Marion, D.",0,10.1136/jramc-2015-000450,487
636,Direct and buffering effects of physical activity on stress-related depression in mothers of infants,"This study examined the role of leisure-time physical activity in reducing the impact of high life stress and time pressure on depression, a buffer effect, for mothers of infants. A direct association between leisure-time physical activity and depression, regardless of both sources of stress, was also tested. A sample of approximately 5,000 mothers of infant children completed questionnaires that measured demographic characteristics, frequency of participation in leisure-time physical activity, life stress, time pressure, and depression (depressive symptoms). Hierarchical multiple regression incorporating an interaction component to represent the buffering effect was used to analyze the data. Frequency of leisure-time physical activity was significantly associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms for both types of stress and acted as a buffer of the association between life stress and depressive symptoms, but did not buffer the influence of time pressure on depressive symptoms. These findings indicated that leisure-time physical activity assists in maintaining the mental health of mothers of infants; however, caution is needed when promoting physical activity for mothers who feel under time pressure.

The intervention lasted 25 months and consisted of seminars, workshops, and workplace specific intervention activities that were developed by focusing on the core task at work. We analyzed within-group changes in the three outcome variables from baseline to follow-up with t-tests for paired samples, separately for intervention and control group. Between-group differences in changes in the three outcome variables were analyzed using a mixed model with a repeated statement to account for the clustering effect of workplaces.Results: Within-group analyses showed that exhaustion decreased statistically significantly in both the intervention and the control group. There were no statistically significantly changes in job satisfaction and sleep disturbances. Between-group analyses showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups for changes in any of the outcome variables, neither in the unadjusted or in the adjusted analyses.Conclusions: We found no evidence that participating in an organizational-level occupational health intervention aiming to improve the working environment with a focus on the core task at work has an effect on pre-school employees' job satisfaction, exhaustion and sleep disturbances.","Framke, Elisabeth; Sorensen, Ole Henning; Pedersen, Jacob; Rugulies, Reiner",1,10.1186/s12889-016-3871-6,490
642,Posttraumatic stress disorder post 9/11: A review of the evidence and implications for public health policy,"Mass fatality incidents due to terrorism are becoming more common. Addressing the mental health needs of the general population and first responders exposed to these attacks is a pressing concern. Following the 9/11 attacks, a wide range of mental and physical health outcomes were reported, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of this paper is to provide a broad overview of the existing data on PTSD in civilian and responder samples following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon to provide guidance for resource planning purposes. We examine the prevalence and course of illness, including evidence on the persistence and late onset of symptoms among a proportion of the population, and review both personal and event-related risk factors across groups. We discuss brief screening instruments necessary for on-going monitoring, and review interventions focusing on building resilience, preventing symptom development, and treating PTSD symptoms. Overall, the literature suggests a substantial burden of PTSD following mass fatality incidents. The epidemiological evidence highlights the importance of managing the health risks associated with volunteering in response to terror attacks. There is relatively clear guidance for the treatment of PTSD in the general public, although there is a need for greater dissemination of treatments and better access to care. Less is known about prevention and treatment for responders. There is empirical support for several psychotherapeutic interventions for PTSD among these responders, but there is less evidence available to guide primary prevention programs for the public or responders. Planners will need to provide resources for long-term support for mental health following terror events and use a flexible approach for delivering available resources.

644,Development and evaluation of an interprofessional communication intervention to improve family outcomes in the ICU,"The intensive care unit (ICU), where death is common and even survivors of an ICU stay face the risk of long-term morbidity and re-admissions to the ICU, represents an important setting for improving communication about palliative and end-of-life care. Communication about the goals of care in this setting should be a high priority since studies suggest that the current quality of ICU communication is often poor and is associated with psychological distress among family members of critically ill patients. This paper describes the development and evaluation of an intervention designed to improve the quality of care in the ICU by improving communication among the ICU team and with family members of critically ill patients. We developed a multi-faceted, interprofessional intervention based on self-efficacy theory. The intervention involves a ""communication facilitator"" - a nurse or social worker - trained to facilitate communication among the interprofessional ICU team and with the critically ill patient's family. The facilitators are trained using three specific content areas: a) evidence-based approaches to improving clinician-family communication in the ICU, b) attachment theory allowing clinicians to adapt communication to meet individual family member's communication needs, and c) mediation to facilitate identification and resolution of conflict including clinician-family, clinician-clinician, and intra-family conflict. The outcomes assessed in this randomized trial focus on psychological distress among family members including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder at 3 and 6 months after the ICU stay. This manuscript also reports some of the lessons that we have learned early in this study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Curtis, J.

645,Randomized Trial of Communication Facilitators to Reduce Family Distress and Intensity of End-of-Life Care,"Rationale: Communication with family of critically ill patients is often poor and associated with family distress.Objectives: To determine if an intensive care unit (ICU) communication facilitator reduces family distress and intensity of end-of-life care.Methods: We conducted a randomized trial at two hospitals. Eligible patients had a predicted mortality greater than or equal to 30% and a surrogate decision maker. Facilitators supported communication between clinicians and families, adapted communication to family needs, and mediated conffict.Measurements and Main Results: Outcomes included depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among family 3 and 6 months after ICU and resource use. We identified 488 eligible patients and randomized 168. Of 352 eligible family members, 268 participated (76%). Family follow-up at 3 and 6 months ranged from 42 to 47%. The intervention was associated with decreased depressive symptoms at 6 months (P = 0.017), but there were no significant differences in psychological symptoms at 3 months or anxiety or PTSD at 6 months. The intervention was not associated with ICU mortality (25% control vs. 21% intervention; P = 0.615) but decreased ICU costs among all patients (per patient: $75,850 control, $51,060 intervention; P = 0.042) and particularly among decedents ($98,220 control, $22,690 intervention; P = 0.028). Among decedents, the intervention reduced ICU and hospital length of stay (28.5 vs. 7.7 d and 31.8 vs. 8.0 d, respectively; P < 0.001).Conclusions: Communication facilitators may be associated with decreased family depressive symptoms at 6 months, but we found no significant difference at 3 months or in anxiety or PTSD. The intervention reduced costs and length of stay, especially among decedents. This is the first study to find a reduction in intensity of end-of-life care with similar or improved family distress.","Curtis, J.

646,Psychological treatments for adults with posttraumatic stress disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Numerous guidelines have been developed over the past decade regarding treatments for Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, given differences in guideline recommendations, some uncertainty exists regarding the selection of effective PTSD therapies. The current manuscript assessed the efficacy, comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of psychological treatments for adults with PTSD. We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PILOTS, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Web of Science. Two reviewers independently selected trials. Two reviewers assessed risk of bias and graded strength of evidence (SOE). We included 64 trials; patients generally had severe PTSD. Evidence supports efficacy of exposure therapy (high SOE) including the manualized version Prolonged Exposure (PE); cognitive therapy (CT), cognitive processing therapy (CPT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-mixed therapies (moderate SOE); eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and narrative exposure therapy (low-moderate SOE). Effect sizes for reducing PTSD symptoms were large (e.g., Cohen's d âˆ¼- 1.0 or more compared with controls). Numbers needed to treat (NNTs) were <. 4 to achieve loss of PTSD diagnosis for exposure therapy, CPT, CT, CBT-mixed, and EMDR. Several psychological treatments are effective for adults with PTSD. Head-to-head evidence was insufficient to determine these treatments' comparative effectiveness, and data regarding adverse events was absent from most studies.

647,Does interpreter-mediated CBT with traumatized refugee people work? A comparison of patient outcomes in east London,"There is controversy about the value of psychological interventions offered to refugee people through an interpreter, but little empirical evidence in this field. This study compared routine clinical outcomes of three groups of PTSD patients receiving CBT: refugees who required interpreters; refugees who did not require an interpreter; and English-speaking non-refugees. The aim of the study was to ascertain whether interpreted CBT is feasible. All three groups attended a similar number of sessions and showed significant improvements after treatment. Refugees receiving treatment with and without interpreting did not differ in treatment outcomes.

649,Evaluation of the evidence for the trauma and fantasy models of dissociation,"The relationship between a reported history of trauma and dissociative symptoms has been explained in 2 conflicting ways. Pathological dissociation has been conceptualized as a response to antecedent traumatic stress and/or severe psychological adversity. Others have proposed that dissociation makes individuals prone to fantasy, thereby engendering confabulated memories of trauma. We examine data related to a series of 8 contrasting predictions based on the trauma model and the fantasy model of dissociation. In keeping with the trauma model, the relationship between trauma and dissociation was consistent and moderate in strength, and remained significant when objective measures of trauma were used. Dissociation was temporally related to trauma and trauma treatment, and was predictive of trauma history when fantasy proneness was controlled. Dissociation was not reliably associated with suggestibility, nor was there evidence for the fantasy model prediction of greater inaccuracy of recovered memory. Instead, dissociation was positively related to a history of trauma memory recovery and negatively related to the more general measures of narrative cohesion. Research also supports the trauma theory of dissociation as a regulatory response to fear or other extreme emotion with measurable biological correlates. We conclude, on the basis of evidence related to these 8 predictions, that there is strong empirical support for the hypothesis that trauma causes dissociation, and that dissociation remains related to trauma history when fantasy proneness is controlled. We find little support for the hypothesis that the dissociation-trauma relationship is due to fantasy proneness or confabulated memories of trauma.

650,The role of community in facilitating service utilization,"Guided by an integrated theory of parent participation, this study examines the role community characteristics play in influencing a parent's decision to use voluntary child abuse prevention programs. Multiple regression techniques were used to determine if different community characteristics, such as neighborhood distress and the community's ratio of caregivers to those in need of care, predict service utilization levels in a widely available home visiting program. Our findings suggest that certain community characteristics are significant predictors of the extent to which families utilize voluntary family supports over and above the proportion of variance explained by personal characteristics and program experiences. Contrary to our initial assumptions, however, new parents living in the most disorganized communities received more home visits than program participants living in more organized communities. The article concludes with recommendations on how community capacity building might be used to improve participant retention. Copyright Â© by The Haworth Press, Inc.

651,A HEALth Promotion and STRESS Management Program (HEAL-STRESS study) for prehypertensive and hypertensive patients: A quasi-experimental study in Greece,"Current hypertension guidelines advocate strategies encouraging healthy lifestyle behaviours. So far, there is a paucity of studies for the efficacy of such multifaceted programmes. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of an 8-week health-promotion programme for lowering blood pressure (BP) in prehypertensive and hypertensive patients in the community. This was a quasi-experimental study using wait-list controls of 548 patients. The intervention group was administered with an 8-week health-promotion intervention. Measurements included home BP, smoking, body mass index (BMI), perceived stress, depression, anxiety and Health Locus of Control. After adjusting for confounders, the intervention group had a significant reduction in both systolic BP (SBP; mean -2.62 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.29 to -3.96) and diastolic BP (DBP; mean -1.0, 95% CI: -0.93 to -1.9) compared with controls. In all, 14.9% of patients in the intervention group had >10 mm Hg reduction in SBP vs 4.4% in the control group (P<0.001, numbers needed to treat (NNT)=10). With regards to DBP, 21.7% of patients in the intervention group had >5 mm Hg reduction vs 12.5% in the control group (P=0.01, NNT=11). In terms of effect size, moderate-to-large improvements of BMI, perceived stress, anxiety, depression, external and chance Health Locus of Control were recorded. Changes in SBP and DBP were attributed to BMI and depressive symptom reductions, respectively. Comprehensive non-pharmaceutical programmes for BP management are strongly encouraged. Their long-term benefits on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain to be established by future research.

652,"The contribution of changes in diet, exercise, and stress management to changes in coronary risk in women and men in the Multisite Cardiac Lifestyle Intervention Program","Background: The relative contribution of health behaviors to coronary risk factors in multicomponent secondary coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention programs is largely unknown. Purpose: Our purpose is to evaluate the additive and interactive effects of 3-month changes in health behaviors (dietary fat intake, exercise, and stress management) on 3-month changes in coronary risk and psychosocial factors among 869 nonsmoking CHD patients (34% female) enrolled in the health insurance-based Multisite Cardiac Lifestyle Intervention Program. Methods: Analyses of variance for repeated measures were used to analyze health behaviors, coronary risk factors, and psychosocial factors at baseline and 3 months. Multiple regression analyses evaluated changes in dietary fat intake and hours per week of exercise and stress management as predictors of changes in coronary risk and psychosocial factors. Results: Significant overall improvement in coronary risk was observed. Reductions in dietary fat intake predicted reductions in weight, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and interacted with increased exercise to predict reductions in perceived stress. Increases in exercise predicted improvements in total cholesterol and exercise capacity (for women). Increased stress management was related to reductions in weight, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (for men), triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (in patients with diabetes), and hostility. Conclusions: Improvements in dietary fat intake, exercise, and stress management were individually, additively and interactively related to coronary risk and psychosocial factors, suggesting that multicomponent programs focusing on diet, exercise, and stress management may benefit patients with CHD.

655,MOMS: Formative evaluation and subsequent intervention for mothers living with HIV,"The Making Our Mothers Stronger (MOMS) Project is a randomized controlled behavioral trial, comparing a stress-reduction and social support intervention (Healthy MOMS) to a parenting skills intervention (Parenting Skills for MOMS) for mothers living with HIV. Outcomes include maternal mental and physical health, parenting behaviors, and children's behavior. To ensure that these interventions were tailored to the needs of HIV + mothers, extensive formative work was conducted with members of the intended audience and relevant service providers. Findings from focus groups and semi-structured interviews highlighted the need for Healthy MOMS to: (1) include appropriate approaches to group discussion and problem solving; (2) address the stressors of being both a parent and a woman living with HIV; and (3) enhance social support. Six weekly group sessions focused on topics including coping with stress and anxiety; enhancing nutrition, exercise, and sexual health; improving medical adherence; improving communication with health care providers; and communicating health needs to family, friends, and co-workers. Initial anecdotal responses from participants suggest that the Healthy MOMS intervention addresses several salient issues for the growing population of HIV + mothers who can benefit from long-term support in adapting to this chronic disease.","Davies S.L., Horton T.V., Williams A.G., Martin M.Y., Stewart K.E.",0,10.1080/09540120802301832,500

Ten relevant databases were searched; these were examined and reference lists checked. Two reviewers applied selection criteria, assessed methodological quality and extracted data from trials. A qualitative synthesis of evidence was undertaken and sensitivity analyses performed. Eight randomised controlled trials and eight non-randomised controlled trials met eligibility criteria. Overall, study quality was poor, with only one trial classified as high quality. There was no strong evidence regarding the efficacy of any interventions aiming to prevent back pain and injury in nurses. The review identified moderate level evidence from multiple trials that manual handling training in isolation is not effective and multidimensional interventions are effective in preventing back pain and injury in nurses. Single trials provided moderate evidence that stress management programs do not prevent back pain and limited evidence that lumbar supports are effective in preventing back injury in nurses. There is conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of exercise interventions and the provision of manual handling equipment and training. This review highlights the need for high quality randomised controlled studies to examine the effectiveness of interventions to prevent back pain and injury in nursing populations.

659,The continuing evolution of biopsychosocial interventions for chronic pain,"In the last several decades, great strides have been made in the treatment of persistent painful conditions. The scope of treatment has shifted from purely biomedical, including approaches built upon cognitive, behavioral, and social psychological principles. This article reports and discusses several key paradigm shifts that fueled this revolutionary change in the management of chronic pain. The progressive development of theoretical metamodels and treatment conceptualizations is presented. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most widely accepted biopsychosocial treatment for chronic pain and is founded upon a rich theoretical tradition. The CBT rationale, and empirical evidence to support its efficacy, is presented. The emergence and promise of mindfulness-based and acceptance-based interventions is also discussed. The article concludes with the assertion that future treatment outcome research should focus on understanding the treatment-specific and common factors associated with efficacy.

In this article the results on women's distress are presented. METHODS: Two hundred sixty-five couples admitted to an IVF treatment programme at the Erasmus MC were asked to participate in this study. Eighty-four couples agreed and were randomized according to a computer-generated random-numbers table into either a routine-care control group or an intervention group. The intervention consisted of three sessions with a social worker trained in Experiential Psychosocial Therapy: one before, one during and one after the first IVF cycle. Distress was measured daily during treatment by the Daily Record Keeping Chart. Depression and anxiety were measured before and after treatment by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: No significant group differences were found. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not support the implementation of our counselling intervention for all first-time IVF couples. The low response rate suggests that there is little perceived need for psychosocial counselling among couples during a first IVF treatment cycle.","de Klerk, C; Hunfeld, JAM; Duivenvoorden, HJ; den Outer, MA; Fauser, BCJM; Passchier, J; Macklon, NS",0,10.1093/humrep/deh748,505
664,Expressive writing as a presurgical stress management intervention for breast cancer patients,"This study evaluated whether expressive writing (EW) was an effective stress management intervention for breast cancer patients. Women were recruited at the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and assigned to write about their cancer experience (EW group; n = 24) or neutral topics (neutral writing [NW] group; n = 25). Women were asked to write for 20 minutes a day for a total of four writing sessions that were completed over a 7-day period. Participants were reassessed approximately 3 days before and 2 weeks after surgery. The intervention did not significantly decrease women's distress, perceived stress, sleep disturbance, or pain. There was some evidence that the EW group used more sleep medication at the presurgical assessment than the NW group. Social constraints moderated the effect of the intervention. Among women with high social constraints, the EW group reported lower average daily pain than the NW group. Among women with low social constraints, the EW group reported higher average daily pain than the NW group. EW was not broadly effective as a stress management intervention for women with breast cancer. These data do not support the use of EW as a presurgical mind-body complementary medicine program for this population.","De Moor J.S., MoyÃ© L., Low M.D., Rivera E., Singletary S.E., Fouladi R.T., Cohen L.",0,10.2310/7200.2008.0010,506
665,Developing interventions for chronically ill patients: Is coping a helpful concept?,"In this review, the role of coping in the development of psychosocial interventions for chronically ill patients is discussed. After summarizing the theoretical issues involved in the translation of the coping concept into an intervention, a review is undertaken of 35 studies concerned with the impact of interventions aimed at improving coping on patients' quality of life. These studies concern seven different chronic disease types (AIDS, asthma, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, chronic pain, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis) and show explicit consideration of attempts to manage illness in terms of coping to be rare. Many studies nevertheless address the equivalent of coping, namely behaviors and/or cognitions intended to deal with an illness situation appraised as stressful. The results of these studies are encouraging, although largely limited to the improvement of one or two particular coping strategies and problem-focused strategies in particular. It is argued that in order to expand on these initially positive findings, greater and more explicit consideration should be given to the potential of the coping concept for intervention with the chronically ill. The appraisal of stressful situations, the use of coping resources, and the strategic application of particular coping strategies should, for example, be given more careful consideration.

666,Fatty acid concentrations in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder compared to healthy controls,"Background Although fatty acid (FA)-supplementation studies are currently being implemented, in fact little is known about FA-profiles in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, the present study aimed at comparing FA-concentrations between PTSD-patients and healthy controls. Methods A cross-sectional study comparing a mixed-gender sample of 49 patients with PTSD due to civilian trauma to 46 healthy controls regarding erythrocyte FAs including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), arachidonic acid (AA), and nervonic acid (NA). Results DHA was found to be significantly lower in PTSD-patients compared to controls after adjusting for sociodemographic and dietary factors (p =0.043). Additionally, exploratory analyses showed lower vaccenic acid (p =0.035) and eicosatrienoic acid (p =0.006), but higher erucic acid (p =0.032) in PTSD-patients. The effect of erucic acid remained after adjustment for sociodemographic factors (p =0.047); with the additional adjustment for dietary factors none of these FAs were found to be significant. Limitations Statistical power for differences with small effect sizes was limited, and dietary assessment could be optimized. Conclusions We found little evidence for a considerable role of FA-metabolism in PTSD. Apart from lower DHA after adjusting for confounders, no differences were observed in the hypothesized long-chained polyunsaturated FA-concentrations. Additionally, we found few alterations in the long-chained monounsaturated FAs, which may be explained by dietary factors. Nevertheless, the observed small effect sizes and limited extent of the alterations emphasize the importance of further investigating the assumed role of FA-metabolism and its underlying mechanisms in PTSD, before implementing further FA-supplementation studies.

667,Public health clinical demonstration project for smoking cessation in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder,"Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder are at high risk for smoking and experience difficulty with smoking cessation. We designed this clinical demonstration project to provide a low-cost, feasibly implemented smoking cessation intervention that would maximize the number of smokers who accessed the intervention. Five hundred eighty-four veteran smokers were contacted by invitational letters. Interested veterans received follow-up telephone calls using standardized scripts offering three intervention resources: 1) a referral to the National Cancer Institute's Smoking Quitline, 2) web-based counseling, and 3) local Veteran Affairs pharmacologic treatment for smoking cessation. Twenty-three percent of survey recipients participated in the clinical program. Two months after these resources were offered by phone, follow-up phone calls indicated that 25% of participants providing follow-up information reported maintaining smoking abstinence. This clinical demonstration project was associated with a 2.6% impact (i.e., reach [31.1% of smokers accessed intervention] by efficacy [8.4% of those accessing intervention quit]), meaning that 2.6% of the total number of targeted smokers reported 8 week abstinence. Results suggested that this brief, low-cost intervention was feasible and promoted smoking cessation in veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder.

668,Effect of Self-Management Intervention on Cortisol and Daily Stress Levels in Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"Self-management programs that include cognitive behavioral strategies have been shown to improve gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, psychological distress, and quality of life (QoL) in persons with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, less is known about the physiological impact of such a change. As part of a randomized controlled trial using a comprehensive self-management (CSM) intervention (n = 126) compared to usual care (UC; n = 62), cortisol levels were measured in 4 weekly first morning urine samples at baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. In addition, diary (28 days) ratings of stress were recorded at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. The omnibus test of all three outcome times showed no differences in urine cortisol levels between the CSM and UC groups (p =.400); however, at 3 months the CSM group had significantly higher cortisol levels than the UC group (p =.012). The CSM group reported lower daily stress levels (p =.046 from the omnibus test of all 3 time points) than the UC group, with the effect getting stronger over time. Despite marked improvements in reported stress and previously reported GI and psychological distress symptoms at later follow-ups, the CSM program did not reduce urine cortisol levels in adults with IBS. These results suggest that the first-void urine cortisol levels are not reflective of self-reported daily stress in this patient population.

669,"Effects of a 105 hours psychological training program on attitudes, communication skills and occupational stress in oncology: a randomised study","There is today a wide consensus regarding the need to improve communication skills (CS) of health-care professionals (HCPs) dealing with cancer patients. Psychological training programs (PTPs) may be useful to acquire the needed CS. Testing the efficacy of PTP will allow to define their optimal content. The present study was designed to assess the impact of a PTP on HCP stress, attitudes and CS, and on HCP and patients satisfaction with HCP communication skills in a randomised study. A total of 115 oncology nurses were randomly assigned to a 105-h PTP or to a waiting list. Stress was assessed with the Nursing Stress Scale, attitudes with a Semantic Differential Questionnaire, CS used during one simulated and one actual patient interview with the Cancer Research Campaign Workshop Evaluation Manual, and satisfaction with the nurses' CS with a questionnaire completed by the patients and the nurses. Trained (TG) and control (CG) groups were compared at baseline, after 3 months (just following training for TG) and after 6 months (3 months after the end of training for TG). Compared to controls, trained nurses reported positive changes on their stress levels (Pless than or equal to0.05) and on their attitudes (Pless than or equal to0.05). Positive training effects were found on CS used during the simulated interview: a significant increase in facilitative behaviours (open questions: Pless than or equal to0.001; evaluative functions: Pless than or equal to0.05) and a significant decrease in inhibitory behaviours (inappropriate information: Pless than or equal to0.01; false reassurance: Pless than or equal to0.05). Less positive training effects were found regarding interviews with a cancer patient: a significant increase in educated guesses (Pless than or equal to0.001) was noticed. No training effect was observed on nurses satisfaction levels, but a positive training effect was found on patients satisfaction levels (Pless than or equal to0.01). Although results outline PTP efficacy, they indicate the need to design PTP, amplifying the transfer of learned CS to clinical practice.","Delvaux, N; Razavi, D; Marchal, S; Bredart, A; Farvacques, C; Slachmuylder, JL",0,10.1038/sj.bjc.6601459,511

When pre-service teachers (also known as initial teacher trainees) develop strong efficacy beliefs, they can be confident in their abilities to be successful teachers once they enter the field. One way pre-service teachers obtain efficacy information is through their emotional states. Positive emotional experiences like joy and satisfaction may enhance a teacherâ€™s sense of efficacy, while undesirable emotions such as fear and worry could be debilitating to efficacy beliefs. The current study investigated how feelings of depression, anxiety, and stress contributed to efficacy beliefs among a sample of 297 American pre-service teachers.

This study evaluated the long-term effectiveness of a two-session cognitive-behavioral dyadic secondary prevention intervention for PTSD delivered by a social worker or a nurse at the emergency department of a hospital. Forty-six recently traumatized men and women - mostly motor-vehicle accident victims - were randomized to either an assessment-only group (n = 20) or the intervention group (n = 26). Among study completers, a significant time-by-group interaction was observed, whereas a sharper mean decrease in self-reported PTSD symptoms (Impact of Event Scale - Revised) was observed in the treated group, going from 34.52 (SD = 19.15) at baseline to 11.19 (15.39) at 2-year follow-up, compared with the control group, which went from 37.82 (16.85) to 23.00 (19.87), F(3, 46) = 4.11, p =.008. At follow-up, no treated participant met criteria for PTSD, compared with five among the control group.

In recent years, it has become a ubiquitous intervention, one which has evolved as almost prescriptive following harrowing events and grew through a practical need to offer assistance to those who are exposed to severe trauma. Despite disturbing data from the recent refereed literature of psychology, it is still referred to as the ""standard of care"" for disaster and crisis response and its use in many quarters continues. This article critically reviews the evidence for and against its use and outlines the weaknesses in the research. The emphasis of this review is on the appropriateness of debriefing in organizations. This article also proposes a set of hypothesized constructs that may, in part, be responsible for the paradoxical effects found in some outcome studies on debriefing.

675,Lipid-based nutrient supplementation in the first 1000 d improves child growth in Bangladesh: a cluster- randomized effectiveness trial,"Background: Stunting in linear growth occurs mainly during the first 1000 d, from conception through 24 mo of age. Despite the recognition of this critical period, there have been few evaluations of the growth impact of interventions that cover most of this window.Objective: We evaluated home fortification approaches for preventing maternal and child undernutrition within a community-based health program. We hypothesized that small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) provided to women during pregnancy and the first 6 mo postpartum, LNSs provided to their offspring from 6 to 24 mo of age, or both would result in greater child length-for-age z score (LAZ) at 24 mo than iron and folic acid (IFA) provided to women during pregnancy and postpartum plus micronutrient powder (MNP) or no supplementation for their offspring from 6 to 24 mo.Design: We conducted a cluster-randomized effectiveness trial with 4 arms: 1) women and children both received LNSs (LNS-LNS group), 2) women received IFA and children received LNSs (IFA-LNS group), 3) women received IFA and children received MNP (IFA-MNP group), and 4) women received IFA and children received no supplements (IFA-Control group). We enrolled 4011 women at <= 20 wk of gestation within 64 clusters, each comprising the supervision area of a community health worker. Analyses were primarily performed by using ANCOVA F tests and Tukey-Kramer-corrected pairwise comparisons.Results: At 24 mo, the LNS-LNS group had significantly higher LAZ (+0.13 compared with the IFA-MNP group) and head circumference (+0.15 z score compared with the IFA-Control group); these outcomes did not differ between the other groups. Stunting prevalence (LAZ,22) was lower in the LNS-LNS group at 18 mo than in the IFA-MNP group (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.92), but the difference diminished by 24 mo (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.04).Conclusion: Home fortification with small-quantity LNSs, but not MNP, during the first 1000 d improved child linear growth and head size in rural Bangladesh.","Dewey, Kathryn G.; Mridha, Malay K.; Matias, Susana L.; Arnold, Charles D.; Cummins, Joseph R.; Khan, Md Showkat Ali; Maalouf-Manasseh, Zeina; Siddiqui, Zakia; Ullah, Md Barkat; Vosti, Stephen A.",0,10.3945/ajcn.116.147942,515

678,Patient and health professional's perceived barriers to the delivery of psychosocial care to adults with cancer: A systematic review,"Objective To explore the barriers experienced and perceived by health professionals and patients in the delivery of psychosocial care to adults with cancer. Methods Systematic searches were undertaken using the Psych Info, Medline and CINAHL electronic databases, up to October 2013. Research reporting health professional or patient experiences and perceptions of barriers to psychosocial care are included in the review. The systematic review includes studies that have non-experimental, exploratory and observational designs, as is appropriate to answer the review question. Included studies were critically appraised. The results of individual quantitative studies were aggregated. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative results. Results Twenty-five papers met the pre-specified inclusion criteria for the final review. The most commonly perceived barrier for patients relates to receiving adequate support from elsewhere and a lack of perceived need for psychosocial care. Health professionals report barriers at an organisational level most frequently followed by cultural and then individual clinician-related barriers. Conclusions Barriers exist on a variety of levels. People with cancer need clear appropriate information and communication about psychosocial services, including information about the role of psychosocial care in addition to existing supports. Interventions that target the complex interplay of individual, organisational and cultural factors need to be developed. Strategies that improve health professional communication skills, identify clear referral pathways, improve acceptability of interventions and clearly identify the need for services could address many of the barriers identified in this review.

In Romania, ART adherence is low despite universal access to HIV care, and improving support services is a priority. We report a qualitative exploration of practitioners experiences and views on ART adherence support, guided by current behavioral theory. Semi-structured interviews were performed with 10 practitioners from six HIV centers, aiming for maximum variation sampling on professional experience, location, and organization type. Questions addressed practitioners views and experiences on assessing patients adherence behaviors and determinants, content and format of adherence support, and perceived influences on their capacity to deliver support. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed via template analysis. Results show that adherence support is provided in Romania by trained psychologists in multidisciplinary teams that operate flexibly and perform multiple HIV care activities. Assessment of adherence behaviors and determinants is primarily interview-based, and practitioners use mostly psychotherapeutic techniques and theories with a degree of intervention tailoring. Practitioners descriptions covered a broad range of common determinants and behavior change techniques, but showed limited use of behavioral theory. Participants also described difficulties to cope with limited resources, and lack of support for managing practical and emotional challenges. Several opportunities for improvement were identified, such as standardizing patient profiling and intervention delivery, conceptualizing and recording active intervention content based on behavioral theory, and actively monitoring intervention effectiveness. This qualitative inquiry provided valuable information for improving adherence support in this clinical context. Understanding practitioners perspectives based on behavioral theory-informed analyses can help intervention developers increase intervention fidelity by integrating current practice information in program design.

682,A comprehensive work injury prevention program with clerical and office workers: Phase II.,"Sixteen full-time clerical and office workers participated in this prospective parallel-randomized trial. Intervention consisted of four hours of individualized training through a multi-faceted injury prevention program. In Phase I, musculoskeletal symptoms, stress, and energy levels were measured before and after intervention. Differences between Group A (intervention) and Group B (control) were described; pre to post differences between members within each group were also described. In Phase II, there were a greater number of statistically and clinically relevant differences within Group A at week 16 (eleven weeks following intervention) than at week five (immediately post-intervention). The eyes, neck, shoulder, elbow-forearm, and wrist-hand were impacted most positively by intervention, however, the frequency and intensity of headaches increased. Stress and energy level differences were minimal. Group B workers received intervention during weeks 18-21. Differences in average measures from pre to immediately post-intervention were greater within Group B than Group A. Both groups reported fewer sick days during the month of intervention than during pre and post-intervention months.","Gatty, Carolyn M",0,,519
683,Knowledge of and attitudes to influenza in unvaccinated primary care physicians and nurses A cross-sectional study,"Primary healthcare workers, especially nurses, are exposed to the vast majority of patients with influenza and play an important role in vaccinating patients. Healthcare workers' misconceptions about influenza and influenza vaccination have been reported as possible factors associated with lack of vaccination. The objective of this study was to compare the characteristics of unvaccinated physicians and unvaccinated nurses in the 2011-2012 influenza season. We performed an anonymous web survey of Spanish primary healthcare workers in 2012. Information was collected on vaccination and knowledge of and attitudes to the influenza vaccine. Multivariate analysis was performed using unconditional logistic regression. We included 461 unvaccinated physicians and 402 unvaccinated nurses. Compared with unvaccinated nurses, unvaccinated physicians had more frequently received seasonal influenza vaccination in the preceding seasons (aOR 1.58; 95% CI 1.11-2.25), and more frequently believed that vaccination of high risk individuals is effective in reducing complications (aOR 2.53; 95% CI 1.30-4.95) and that influenza can be a serious illness (aOR 1.65; 95% CI 1.17-2.32). In contrast, unvaccinated physicians were less concerned about infecting patients (aOR 0.62; 95% CI 0.40-0.96). Unvaccinated nurses had more misconceptions than physicians about influenza and the influenza vaccine and more doubts about the severity of annual influenza epidemics in patients with high risk conditions and the prevention of complications by means of the influenza vaccination. For unvaccinated physicians, strategies to improve vaccination coverage should stress the importance of physicians as a possible source of infection of their patients. The effectiveness of influenza vaccination of high risk persons should be emphasized in nurses.","Dominguez, Angela; Godoy, Pere; Castilla, Jesus; Maria Mayoral, Jose; Soldevila, Nuria; Torner, Nuria; Toledo, Diana; Astray, Jenaro; Tamames, Sonia; Garcia-Gutierrez, Susana; Gonzalez-Candelas, Fernando; Martin, Vicente; Diaz, Jose",0,10.4161/hv.29142,520
684,Temporal Associations Among Chronic PTSD Symptoms in U.S. Combat Veterans,"The present study examined fluctuation over time in symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 34 combat veterans (28 with diagnosed PTSD, 6 with subclinical symptoms) assessed every 2 weeks for up to 2 years (range of assessments = 13-52). Temporal relationships were examined among four PTSD symptom clusters (reexperiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal) with particular attention to the influence of hyperarousal. Multilevel cross-lagged random coefficients autoregression for intensive time series data analyses were used to model symptom fluctuation decades after combat experiences. As anticipated, hyperarousal predicted subsequent fluctuations in the 3 other PTSD symptom clusters (reexperiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing) at subsequent 2-week intervals (rs =45,.36, and.40, respectively). Additionally, emotional numbing influenced later reexperiencing and avoidance, and reexperiencing influenced later hyperarousal (rs =44,.40, and.34, respectively). These findings underscore the important influence of hyperarousal. Furthermore, results indicate a bidirectional relationship between hyperarousal and reexperiencing as well as a possible chaining of symptoms (hyperarousal â†’ emotional numbing â†’ reexperiencing â†’ hyperarousal) and establish potential internal, intrapersonal mechanisms for the maintenance of persistent PTSD symptoms. Results suggested that clinical interventions targeting hyperarousal and emotional numbing symptoms may hold promise for PTSD of long duration.

685,Depressive symptoms in persons with acute coronary syndrome: Specific symptom scales and prognosis,"Objective: To determine which particular depressive symptom scales, derived from three scales, predicted poorer prognosis in persons with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods: Hospitalized ACS patients (n=408) completed questionnaires (depression, vital exhaustion). Mokken scaling derived unidimensional scales. Major cardiac events (cardiac mortality, ACS, unplanned revascularization) were assessed at median 67 weeks post event. Results: Only depressive symptoms of fatigue-sadness predicted prognosis in univariate (hazard ratio [HR]=1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0, P=.025) and multivariate analysis (HR=1.8, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, P=.025). Symptoms of anhedonia (HR=1.6, 95% CI 0.9-2.8, P=.102) and depressive cognitions (HR=1.3, 95% CI 0.7-2.2, P=.402) did not. Conclusion: Symptoms of fatigue-sadness, but not other symptoms, were associated with increased risk of major cardiac events. Depression should be considered as a multidimensional, rather than a unidimensional, entity when designing interventions. Â© 2010 Elsevier Inc.

686,Stress in caregivers of aphasic stroke patients: a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Communication difficulties due to aphasia following stroke are particularly stressful to caregivers.Objective: To examine the impact of a psychoeducation programme on caregivers, burden and stress and communication between the caregiver and aphasic stroke patient.Design: Randomized wait-list controlled trial with immediate or three-month delayed treatment.Setting: Three public hospital rehabilitation services in Sydney, Australia.Subjects: Thirty-nine caregivers of aphasic stroke patients, up to 12 months post stroke: 19 given immediate treatment and 20 in a delayed treatment control group.Interventions: Four-session weekly caregiver programme that included elements of education, support and communication skills conducted by a speech pathologist, social worker and clinical psychologist.Main measures: The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) was used to measure caregiver stress, the Relatives' Stress Scale was used to measure caregiver burden and a communication questionnaire was designed specifically for this project.Results: Thirty-one caregivers completed the study. Caregivers in the immediate treatment group had significant reductions in GHQ measured stress (GHQ mean (SD) at baseline = 6.26 (5.67), GHQ post treatment 3.21 (SD 4.20), P= 0.006). There was no improvement in wait-listed caregivers. Improvement was not maintained at three-month follow-up. There were no significant effects of the programme on communication skills or on caregiver burden.Conclusions: Stroke caregiver support, education and training programmes have short-term effects on caregiver stress levels but are likely to require ongoing involvement to maintain their effect.","Draper, Brian; Bowring, Greg; Thompson, Claire; Van Heyst, Jocelyn; Conroy, Philip; Thompson, Julie",0,10.1177/0269215506071251,523

688,Long-Term Results of a Web-Based Guided Self-Help Intervention for Employees With Depressive Symptoms: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Depressive disorders are highly prevalent in the working population and are associated with excessive costs. The evidence for effective worker-directed interventions for employees with depressive symptoms is limited. Treating employees with depressive symptoms via the Internet before they report sick from work could be beneficial and cost saving.Objective: In this study, we tested the effectiveness over the period of 1 year of a Web-based guided self-help intervention, called Happy@Work, for employees with depressive symptoms who were not on sick leave.Methods: A two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a worker-directed, Web-based, guided self-help intervention to care as usual (CAU) was carried out. We recruited employees from 6 companies via the company's Intranet and by putting up posters. The inclusion criteria were elevated depressive symptoms as measured by a score >= 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) and not being on sick leave. The intervention contained 6 lessons and consisted of problem-solving treatment and cognitive therapy. Participants were asked to submit weekly assignments via the website after completion of a lesson and they received feedback from a coach via the website. Self-report questionnaires on depressive symptoms (CES-D; primary outcome), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI), work performance (Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, HPQ), duration of absenteeism, and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS; secondary outcomes), were completed at baseline, posttreatment, and at 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Several subgroup and per-protocol analyses were performed.Results: A total of 231 employees were randomized to either the intervention group (n=116) or to CAU (n=115). Completion of assessments varied between 54%-74%. Improvement in depressive symptoms between baseline and posttreatment was shown in all participants and these effects sustained over time. However, there were no differences between the 2 groups (adjusted regression coefficient=0.46, 95% CI -2.11 to 3.03, P=.72; Cohen's d=0.05). Differences between groups were also not significant for the secondary outcomes. No subgroups were identified to show differences between the groups, nor did we find a between-group effect in the per-protocol analyses.Conclusions: This study showed that a worker-directed, Web-based, guided self-help intervention was not more effective than CAU in reducing depressive symptoms among employees with depressive symptoms who were not on sick leave over the period of 1 year. An intervention for this specific target group might not be necessary because the recovery in the CAU group was comparable to the intervention group and sustained over a 12-month period.","Geraedts, Anna S.; Kleiboer, Annet M.; Twisk, Jos; Wiezer, Noortje M.; van Mechelen, Willem; Cuijpers, Pim",1,10.2196/jmir.3539,525
689,"Suicide at 50 years of age and older: Perceived physical illness, family and financial strain","Background. Mental disorders amplify suicide risk across the lifecourse, but most people with mental disorder do not take their own lives. Few controlled studies have examined the contribution of stressors to suicide risk. Method. A case-control design was used to compare 86 suicides and 86 controls aged 50 years and older, matched on age, gender, race and county of residence. Structured interviews were conducted with proxy respondents for suicides and controls. Results. Perceived physical illness, family discord and employment change amplified suicide risk after controlling for sociodemographic covariates and mental disorders that developed â‰¥ 1 year prior to death/interview. Only the effect of physical illness (OR 6.24, 95% CI 1.28-51.284) persisted after controlling for all active mental disorders. Conclusions. Interventions to decrease the likelihood of financial stress and to help families manage discord and severe physical illness may effectively reduce suicides among middle-aged and older adults.","Duberstein P.R., Conwell Y., Conner K.R., Eberly S., Caine E.D.",0,10.1017/S0033291703008584,526
691,The Safe Environment for Every Kid Model: Impact on Pediatric Primary Care Professionals,"OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the Safe Environment for Every Kid (SEEK) model of enhanced primary care would improve the attitudes, knowledge, comfort, competence, and behavior of child health care professionals (HPs) regarding addressing major risk factors for child maltreatment (CM).METHODS: In a cluster randomized controlled trial, 18 private practices were assigned to intervention (SEEK) or control groups. SEEK HPs received training on CM risk factors (eg, maternal depression). The SEEK model included the parent screening questionnaire and the participation of a social worker. SEEK's impact was evaluated in 3 ways: (1) the health professional questionnaire (HPQ), which assessed HPs' attitudes and practice regarding the targeted problems; (2) observations of HPs conducting checkups; and (3) review of children's medical records.RESULTS: The 102 HPs averaged 45 years of age; 68% were female, and 74% were in suburban practices. Comparing baseline scores with 6-, 18-, and 36-month follow-up data, the HPQ revealed significant (P < .05) improvement in the SEEK group compared with controls on addressing depression (6 months), substance abuse (18 months), intimate partner violence (6 and 18 months), and stress (6, 18, and 36 months), and in their comfort level and perceived competence (both at 6, 18, and 36 months). SEEK HPs screened for targeted problems more often than did controls based on observations 24 months after the initial training and the medical records (P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: The SEEK model led to significant and sustained improvement in several areas. This is a crucial first step in helping HPs address major psychosocial problems that confront many families. SEEK offers a modest yet promising enhancement of primary care.

One promising strategy for explicating the effects of early home visiting is to examine moderators of program impacts. This study assessed the roles of maternal depression and attachment insecurity as moderators of the impacts of Healthy Families Alaska home visiting services for at-risk mothers and their infants. At-risk families (N = 325) were randomly assigned to home visiting or community services as usual (n = 162 and 163, respectively). Maternal depression and attachment insecurity (attachment anxiety and discomfort with trust/dependence) were measured at baseline. Maternal psychosocial and parenting outcomes were measured when children were 2 years old via maternal self-report, observation, and review of substantiated reports of child maltreatment. Maternal depression and attachment insecurity interacted in their moderation of program impacts. For several outcomes, home visiting impacts were greatest for nondepressed mothers with moderate-to-high discomfort with trust/dependence and for depressed mothers with low discomfort with trust/dependence.

The present study was designed to investigate whether the biofeedback-based stress management tool consisting of rhythmic breathing, actively self-generated positive emotions and a portable biofeedback device induce changes in athletesâ€™ HRV, EEG patterns, and self-reported anxiety and self-esteem. The study involved 41 healthy male athletes, aged 16â€“21 (mean 18.34Â Â±Â 1.36) years. Participants were randomly divided into two groups: biofeedback and control. Athletes in the biofeedback group received HRV biofeedback training, athletes in the control group didnâ€™t receive any intervention. During the randomized controlled trial (days 0â€“21), the mean anxiety score declined significantly for the intervention group (change-4 pÂ <Â 0.001) but not for the control group (pÂ =Â 0.817). In addition, as compared to the control, athletes in biofeedback group showed substantial and statistically significant improvement in heart rate variability indices and changes in power spectra of both theta and alpha brain waves, and alpha asymmetry. These changes suggest better self-control in the central nervous system and better flexibility of the autonomic nervous system in the group that received biofeedback training. A HRV biofeedback-based stress management tool may be beneficial for stress reduction for young male athletes.

This article presents an overview of the field, acknowledging the close relationship between the study of post-traumatic stress disorder more specifically and the field of traumatic stress studies in general. The authors focus on four key dimensions: historical and conceptual issues, diagnostic features and debates, aetiological research findings in relation to vulnerability to disorder and treatment approaches to post-traumatic stress disorder and related conditions. It is observed that there is both extension and deepening of knowledge based upon scientific advances such as neuroimaging and gene mapping technology, employment of meta-analyses, increased attention to randomized control studies and emphasis on more comparative research. Alongside such developments is the posing of important philosophical and psychosocial questions and increasing recognition of the need to contextualize both where and how established knowledge has been generated and how this may need to be expanded.

702,Children with medical complexity: a scoping review of interventions to support caregiver stress,"Background: Caring for children with chronic and complex medical needs places extraordinary stress on parents and other family members. A scoping review was undertaken to identify and describe the full range of current interventions for reducing caregiver stress. Methods: Applying a broad definition of caregiver stress, a systematic search of three scientific databases (CINAHL, Embase and Ovid Medline), a general internet search and hand searching of key peer-reviewed articles were conducted. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) published in English between 2004â€“2016; (ii) focused on familial caregivers, defined as parents, siblings or extended family; (iii) targeted children/youth with medical complexity between the ages of 1â€“24 years; and (iv) described an intervention and impact on caregiver stress. Data on type of intervention, study design and methods, measures and overall findings were extracted. Results: Forty-nine studies were included from a list of 22 339 unique titles. Six domains of interventions were found: care coordination models (n = 23); respite care (n = 8); telemedicine (n = 5); peer and emotional support (n = 6); insurance and employment benefits (n = 4); and health and related supports (n = 3). Across studies, there was a wide variety of designs, outcomes and measures used. Conclusions: Positive findings of reductions in caregiver stress were noted within an emerging body of evidence on effective interventions for families of children with medical complexity. A commonality across domains was a significant focus on streamlining services and reducing the burden of care related to varied pressures experienced, including time, finances, care needs and service access, among others. There was non-conclusive evidence however around which of the six identified intervention domains or combination thereof are most effective for reducing stress. These promising findings demonstrate that stress reduction is possible with the right support and that multiple interventions may be effective in reducing burdens of care experienced by families of children with medical complexity.

Twenty-three sedentary male workers were randomly assigned into 2 different exercise programs: a Long-bout group, which performed a single period of continuous exercise (Long-bout group: 30 min x 1) 3 d per week, and a Short-bouts group, which performed 3 short bouts of exercise (Short-bouts group: 10 min x 3) 3 d per week. Cardiovascular risk factors, including the plasma thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) level, were examined at baseline and after both 10 and 20 wk. In the Long-bout group, waist circumference and maximum oxygen uptake ((V) over dotO(2max)) significantly improved after 20 wk. The Short-bouts group demonstrated significant increases in (V) over dotO(2max) after 10 weeks and in HDL-C after 20 wk. Plasma TBARS significantly decreased after 20 weeks in the Long-bout group and tended to decrease (but not significantly) in the Short-bouts group. These results indicate that accumulated short bouts of exercise are an effective option, especially for busy workers, for incorporating exercise into one's lifestyle.","Eguchi, Masafumi; Ohta, Masanori; Yamato, Hiroshi",0,10.2486/indhealth.2013-0023,537
708,Psychosocial Aspects of Hereditary Cancer (PAHC) questionnaire: Development and testing of a screening questionnaire for use in clinical cancer genetics,"Background Up to three-quarters of individuals who undergo cancer genetic counseling and testing report psychosocial problems specifically related to that setting. The objectives of this study were to develop and evaluate the screening properties of a questionnaire designed to assess specific psychosocial problems related to cancer genetic counseling. Methods We adopted the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Group guidelines to develop the Psychosocial Aspects of Hereditary Cancer (PAHC) questionnaire, a 26-item questionnaire organized into six problem domains: genetics, practical issues, family, living with cancer, emotions, and children. The Distress Thermometer and a question per domain on the perceived need for extra psychosocial services were included as well. We administered the questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale to 127 counselees at the time of genetic counseling and 3 weeks after DNA test disclosure. As a gold standard to evaluate the screening properties of the questionnaire, participants underwent a semi-structured interview with an experienced social worker who assessed the presence and severity of problems per domain. Results A cutoff score representing responses of 'quite a bit' or 'very much' to one or more items within a given problem domain yielded moderate to high sensitivity across domains. A cutoff of 4 on the Distress Thermometer yielded high sensitivity. The questions regarding the perceived need for extra psychosocial services yielded high specificity and negative predictive values. Conclusion The Psychosocial Aspects of Hereditary Cancer questionnaire in combination with the Distress Thermometer can be used as a first-line screener for psychosocial problems within the cancer genetic counseling setting.

709,Effectiveness of Balancing Everyday Life (BEL) versus standard occupational therapy for activity engagement and functioning among people with mental illness - a cluster RCT study,"Background: Many with a mental illness have an impoverished everyday life with few meaningful activities and a sedentary lifestyle. The study aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of the 16-week Balancing Everyday Life (BEL) program, compared to care as usual (CAU), for people with mental illness in specialized and community-based psychiatric services. The main outcomes concerned different aspects of subjectively evaluated everyday activities, in terms of the engagement and satisfaction they bring, balance among activities, and activity level. Secondary outcomes pertained to various facets of well-being and functioning. It was hypothesized that those who received the BEL intervention would improve more than the comparison group regarding activity, well-being and functioning outcomes.Methods: BEL is a group and activity-based lifestyle intervention. CAU entailed active support, mainly standard occupational therapy. The BEL group included 133 participants and the CAU group 93. They completed self-report questionnaires targeting activity and well-being on three occasions - at baseline, after completed intervention (at 16 weeks) and at a six-month follow-up. A research assistant rated the participants' level of functioning and symptom severity on the same occasions. Non-parametric statistics were used since these instruments produced ordinal data.Results: The BEL group improved more than the CAU group from baseline to 16 weeks on primary outcomes in terms of activity engagement (p < 0.001), activity level (p = 0.036) and activity balance (p < 0.042). The BEL group also improved more on the secondary outcomes of symptom severity (p < 0.018) and level of functioning (p < 0. 046) from baseline to 16 weeks, but not on well-being. High intra-class correlations (0.12-0.22) indicated clustering effects for symptom severity and level of functioning. The group differences on activity engagement (p = 0.001) and activity level (p = 0.007) remained at the follow-up. The BEL group also improved their well-being (quality of life) more than the CAU group from baseline to the follow-up (p = 0.049). No differences were found at that time for activity balance, level of functioning and symptom severity.Conclusion: The BEL program was effective compared to CAU in terms of activity engagement. Their improvements were not, however, greater concerning other subjective perceptions, such as satisfaction with daily activities and self-rated health, and clustering effects lowered the dependability regarding findings of improvements on symptoms and functioning. Although the CAU group had ""caught up"" at the follow-up, the BEL group had improved more on general quality of life. BEL appeared to be important in shortening the time required for participants to develop their engagement in activity and in attaining improved quality of life in a follow-up perspective.","Eklund, Mona; Tjornstrand, Carina; Sandlund, Mikael; Argentzell, Elisabeth",0,10.1186/s12888-017-1524-7,539
710,Sleep physiology in recovery from burnout,"This study aimed to investigate the role of sleep physiology in recovery from burnout, in particular the relation between sleep and changes in fatigue and whether those changes would be related to return to work. 23 white-collar workers on long-term sick leave (>3 months) due to a burnout related diagnosis and 16 healthy controls were subjected to polysomnographic recordings at baseline and after 6-12 months' rehabilitation. Occupational status, subjective sleep quality, fatigue, anxiety and depression were assessed. Recovery from burnout was accompanied by improved sleep continuity. Significant interaction effects were seen for number of arousals, sleep fragmentation, sleep latency, sleep efficiency and time of rising. The burnout group improved significantly on all symptom variables although the post-treatment levels did not reach the levels of the controls. Recovery from fatigue was related to a reduction of the arousal from sleep and was the best predictor of return to work. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

712,Building capacity and resilience in the dementia care workforce: A systematic review of interventions targeting worker and organizational outcomes,"Background: Dementia increasingly impacts every health and social care system in the world. Preparing the dementia care workforce is therefore paramount, particularly in light of existing problems of staff retention and turnover. Training interventions will need to increase worker and organizational capacity to deliver effective patient care. It is not clear which training interventions best enhance workers' capacity. A review of the evidence for dementia care training interventions to enhance worker capacity and facilitate organizational change is presented. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted. All selected randomized intervention studies aimed to enhance some aspect of dementia care worker or workforce capacity such as knowledge of dementia, psychological well-being, work performance, and organizational factors such as retention or service delivery in dementia care. Results: Seventy-four relevant studies were identified, but only six met inclusion criteria for the review. The six studies selected focused on worker and organizational outcomes in dementia care. All interventions were multi-component with dementia education or instructional training most commonly adopted. No interventions were found for the community setting. Variable effects were found for intervention outcomes and methodological concerns are raised. Conclusion: The rigor of scientific research in training interventions that aim to build capacity of dementia care workers is poor and a strong need exists for evaluation and delivery of such interventions in the community sphere. Wider domains of interest such as worker psychological health and well-being need to be examined further, to understand capacity-building in the dementia care workforce.

715,What prevents professional drivers from following physicians' cardiologic advice?,"There is a scarcity of published studies of the effects of cardiac counselling among professional drivers (PD). Aims of the study were: (1) to examine explanatory variables for two classical 'driver' risk factors - body mass index (BMI), and smoking - and to analyse the interrelations among smoking cessation, losing weight and work-related life changes; (2) to assess the effectiveness of risk factor counselling after 6 months, and (3) to gain insight into possible discrepancies between PD perception of needed changes and compliance with the physician's advice. Methods: There were 4 groups of male PD: 13 with ischemic heart disease, 12 hypertensives, 10 borderline hypertensives and 34 normotensives. Baseline cardiovascular risk factors as well as occupational and behavioral data were assessed via questionnaire. The counselling was aimed at smoking cessation, weight loss and promoting leisure-time physical activity. Qualitative methods were used to assess PD perceptions about the work environment and health promotion. Results: Baseline smoking intensity was best predicted by the total burden of occupational stress and number of smoking years. Baseline BMI was best predicted by long work hours behind the wheel, low availability of attachment outside work and low self-reported job strain. Self-initiated smoking cessation was best predicted by few smoking years, low coffee intake and admitting fear during driving. Physical activity was significantly increased after 6 months. Losing weight was associated with: quitting or diminishing smoking and making other, work related, life changes. None of the heavy smokers decreased their daily number of cigarettes after 6 months, although expressing the need to do so in self generated statements. Conclusions: Exposure to occupational stressors, mainly, long work hours and the concomitant denial of job strain, in combination with low availability of social attachment outside work, could contribute to maintenance of maladaptive behavior in PD. These findings could serve as a basis for designing standardized intervention trials and suggest that modification of the work environment, with participation of the drivers, is a needed component of such trials. Particular attention should be paid to the length and scheduling of work shifts.","Emdad R., Belkic K., Theorell T., Cizinsky S.",0,,542

717,Seeking Safety Group Therapy for Co-Occurring Substance Use Disorder and PTSD among Transgender Women Living with HIV: A Pilot Study,"Transgender women living with HIV experience high rates of substance use, violence, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Seeking Safety is a manualized, present-focused, cognitive-behavioral therapy program designed to address co-occurring substance use and PTSD. Seeking Safety has evidence of efficacy in a variety of populations but had not been evaluated specifically with people living with HIV or transgender women. We pilot-tested a 12-session Seeking Safety program with a group of transgender women living with HIV who reported substance use and a history of violence. Seven transgender women living with HIV were recruited from two HIV primary care clinics in San Francisco and completed pre- and post-intervention assessments. Participants attended an average of 8 of the 12 sessions. Mean scores for all three outcome measures improved: PTSD symptom scores declined 17.5%, alcoholism screening scores declined 23.9%, and drug abuse screening scores declined 68.8%, on average. Despite the small sample, this pilot study showed Seeking Safety to be a promising intervention among transgender women living with HIV. The findings are encouraging and justify larger studies of Seeking Safety among transgender women and other people living with HIV who experience high rates of substance use and PTSD.

718,"Childhood sexual abuse characteristics, intimate partner violence exposure, and psychological distress among women in methadone treatment","Traumatic experiences and their biopsychosocial sequelae present complex challenges in substance use treatment. For women with substance use problems, childhood sexual abuse (CSA), intimate partner violence exposure (IPV), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and overall psychological distress are often co-occurring concerns. To address gaps in knowledge and to strengthen practice regarding these critical issues in substance use treatment, we drew upon cross-sectional and longitudinal data from baseline and 12-month interviews with a random sample of 416 women in methadone treatment to examine relationships between CSA characteristics, particularly the presence of force and involvement of family, IPV, and mental health concerns. Although CSA involving force and family was not associated with IPV as hypothesized, it was associated with increased risk of PTSD and overall psychological distress. The multivariate findings underscore the psychological vulnerabilities associated with CSA involving force and family and suggest that drug use and financial circumstances may be important targets to reduce IPV risk.

There has been some concern that existing treatment programs for combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may not fit well with OEF/OIF veterans confronted with acute mental health difficulties while reestablishing community, familial, and occupational connections after their deployment. This study utilized data gathered from a large outpatient Veterans Affairs Medical Center PTSD treatment clinic to examine differences in initial treatment presentation and treatment adherence (attendance and dropout) between a group of Vietnam era veterans (n = 54) and a group of OEF/OIF veterans (n = 106). OEF/OIF veterans reported lower levels of symptom distress on questionnaires assessing posttraumatic reexperiencing, avoidance, dissociation, and arousal symptoms but similar levels of anger and acting out behaviors and higher levels of alcohol problems. OEF/OIF veterans had significantly lower rates of session attendance and higher rates of treatment dropout than Vietnam veterans, and this difference was not accounted for by differences in treatment presentation.

These gains were maintained at longest follow-up (d+ = 0.58 to 0.86) for the wait-list, treatment-as-usual, and single-group comparisons, but not for the follow-up placebo comparison (d+ = 0.15), probably because of the low power (j = 3 placebo studies). Clinical trial findings were synthesized using a random-effects model. No effects of publication bias or moderating variables were evident.

722,Stress management and mind-body medicine: A randomized controlled longitudinal evaluation of students' health and effects of a behavioral group intervention at a middle-size German University (SM-MESH),"Background: Student life can be stressful. Hence, we started a regular mind-body medical stress management program in 2006. By today, more than 500 students took part and evaluations showed significant results, especially with regard to a reduction of stress warning signals. For further analysis, we now decided to run a randomized controlled longitudinal trial. Methods: Participating students at Coburg University were randomized into an intervention (n = 24) or a waitlist control group (n = 19). The intervention group completed 3 sets (pre/post/follow-up) and the control group 2 sets (pre/post) of self-administered questionnaires. The questionnaires included: SF-12 Health Survey, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Sense of Coherence (SOC-L9), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) concerning stress, and the Stress Warning Signs (SWS) scale. Randomly selected participants of the intervention group were also queried in qualitative interviews. The intervention consisted of an 8 week stress management group program (mind-body medical stress reduction - MBMSR). Follow-up measures were taken after 6 months. Results: Virtually, no drop-out occurred. Our study showed significant effects in the intervention group concerning SF-12 Mental Component Scale (p = 0.05), SF-12 Physical Component Scale (p = 0.001), VAS (in general, p = 0.001) and SWS (emotional reactions, p <0.001), underlined by qualitative results, which showed a higher quality of life. Conclusions: The effectiveness of an MBMSR program in a group of supposedly healthy students could be demonstrated. Findings suggest that stress management might be given importance at universities that care for the performance, the quality of life, and stress-health status of their students, acknowledging and accounting for the challenging circumstances of university life, as well as the specific needs of the modern student population.

723,Cognitive impairments in former patients with work-related stress complaints â€“ one year later,"Patients on sick leave due to work-related stress often present with cognitive impairments. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to examine the long-term consequences of prolonged work-related stress in terms of cognitive functioning one year after initial professional care seeking. We tested a group of patients with work-related stress with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery at two occasions, one year apart. At both time points, we compared the performance of patients with healthy controls matched pairwise on sex, age and length of education. This paper presents the results from the one-year follow-up. When adjusting for practice effects, patients improved on measures of prospective memory and processing speed. However, patients continued to perform worse than controls on all tests, though only half of the comparisons reached statistical significance. The effect sizes of the differences between the two groups at one-year follow-up were small to medium. In conclusion, former patients with prolonged work-related stress improved, but they continued to perform worse than controls after one year. In the acute phase, the largest impairments were related to executive function and mental speed but at follow-up memory impairments also became apparent.

724,Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for primary school teachers,"Stress within the teaching profession has a negative impact on the health and well-being of individual teachers and on retention and recruitment for the profession as a whole. There is increasing literature to suggest that Mindfulness is a useful intervention to address a variety of psychological problems, and that Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a particularly helpful intervention for stress. We investigated the effects of teaching a MBSR course to primary school teachers to reduce stress. The MBSR course was taught to a group of primary school teachers and evaluated to establish its effects on levels of anxiety, depression, and stress, as well as movement towards a stated goal and changes in awareness. The results showed improvement for most participants for anxiety, depression, and stress, some of which were statistically significant. There were also significant improvements on two of the four dimensions of a mindfulness skills inventory. These results suggest that this approach could be a potentially cost-effective method to combat teacher stress and burnout.

This research reports on 18-month outcomes of a randomized clinical trial of a stress-management program based on the transtheoretical model (TTM; J. O. Prochaska & C. C. DiClemente, 1986). A national sample of 1,085 individuals participated (age range = 18-91 years, M = 55.33; 68.9% female, 31.1% male; 84.8% Caucasian; 15.2% non-Caucasian). Both the treatment and control groups received assessments at 0, 6, 12, and 18 months. In addition to the assessments, the treatment group received 3 individualized reports (0, 3, 6 months) and a manual. The 18-month assessment was completed by 778 individuals (72%). A random effects model indicated that participants completing the study in the treatment group had significantly more individuals reporting effective stress management at follow-up time points than did completers in the control group. Results also indicate that the intervention had significant effects on stress, depression, and specific stress-management behaviors.

727,The Comparative Effectiveness of a Multimodal Program Versus Exercise Alone for the Secondary Prevention of Chronic Low Back Pain and Disability,"Objective: The objective of this study was to examine whether a multimodal, secondary prevention program (MP) is superior to a general physical exercise program (EP) in influencing the process leading to chronic low back pain (LBP) in nurses with a history of back pain.Design: The study was conducted as a randomized controlled parallel-group trial.Setting: The interventions were performed in a single center at the Department of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Munich in Germany.Participants: A total of 235 nurses from 14 nearby hospitals and nursing homes who experienced at least one episode of back pain during the previous 2 years were invited into the study. Of these, 183 nurses were enrolled and 169 (83 in the MP and 86 in the EP) qualified for the intent-to-treat analysis.Interventions: The EP consisted of 11 group sessions, each lasting 1 hour. After introductory sessions, subsequent sessions included general physical strengthening and stretching exercises as well as instructions for a home-training program. The MP consisted of 17 group sessions of 1.75 hours and one individual session of 45 minutes. In addition to the full EP, the MP included 5 psychological units, 7 segmental stabilization exercises units, and 8 ergonomic and workplace-specific units.Main Outcome Measurements: The primary study end-point variable was pain interference, and the secondary study end-point variables were pain intensity and functioning as measured with the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory and the Short Form-36, respectively. These study end-point variables were defined a priori.Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups. Small-to-moderate effects were observed in both intervention programs across all study end-point variables. For pain interference, the effect size at 12 months after intervention was 0.58 in the MP and 0.47 in the EP.Conclusions: A multimodal program is not superior to a general exercise program in influencing the process leading to chronic LBP in a population of nurses with a history of pain. The most likely explanation is a common psychological mechanism leading to improved pain interference that is irrespective of the program used. Considering the lower resources of the general exercise program, the expense for a multimodal program is not justified for the secondary prevention of LBP and disability.","Ewert, Thomas; Limm, Heribert; Wessels, Tina; Rackwitz, Berid; von Garnier, Katharina; Freumuth, Robert; Stucki, Gerold",0,10.1016/j.pmrj.2009.07.006,552

On each week, participants abstained from all dietary sources of caffeine before undergoing a 6-h laboratory protocol under placebo or caffeine exposure followed by a 30-min mental stressor with blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular hemodynamic assessments. On the placebo session, men and women showed a significant BP increase to stress, although women had significant cardiac responses whereas men had vascular responses. Caffeine ingestion before stress caused both men and women to have enhanced hemodynamic responses to the stressor associated with an increase in cardiac index and a drop in the peripheral resistance index. Caffeine enhances the cardiovascular fight-or-flight response pattern to stress in men and women.

Due to insufficient pharmacological data, most of the herbal formulations containing these molecules cannot be recommended for the treatment of liver disease.Objective: To present the most promising compounds tested experimentally and/or clinically and describe in brief popular models in experimental testing of potential hepatoprotective compounds.Methods: A literature search using Web of Science (WOS), PubMed, and Google search was performed.Results: Focusing on a few herbal hepatoprotective active constituents is useful to health professionals working in the field of therapeutics to develop evidence-based hepatoprotective agents by conducting research on pure chemical structures or on molecular modifications using computational chemistry. This review demonstrates that multi-pathways in the liver pathobiology can be interrupted at one or more levels by natural hepatoprotective studied, such as interference with the oxidative stress at multiple levels to reduce reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, resulting in ameliorating hepatotoxicity.Conclusion: Hepatoprotective constituents of herbal medications are poorly absorbed after oral administration; methods that can improve their bioavailability are being developed. It is recommended that controlled prospective double-blind multicenter studies on isolated active plant constituents, or on related newly designed molecules after structural modifications, should be performed. This effort will lead to expanding the existing, limited drugs for the vast majority of liver diseases.","Farghali, Hassan; Canova, Nikolina Kutinova; Zakhari, Samir",0,10.3109/13880209.2014.950387,554

Among factors affecting individual vulnerability to all types of disease, the following have been highlighted by recent research: recent and early life events, chronic stress and allostatic load, personality, psychological well- being, health attitudes and behavior. As to the interaction between psychological and biological factors in the course and outcome of disease, the presence of psychiatric (DSM-IV) as well as subclinical (Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research) symptoms, illness behavior and the impact on quality of life all need to be assessed. The prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of physical illness include the consideration for psychosomatic prevention, the treatment of psychiatric morbidity and abnormal illness behavior and the use of psychotropic drugs in the medically ill. In the past 60 years, psychosomatic medicine has addressed some fundamental questions, contributing to the growth of other related disciplines, such as psychoneuroendocrinology, psychoimmunology, consultation-liaison psychiatry, behavioral medicine, health psychology and quality of life research. Psychosomatic medicine may also provide a comprehensive frame of reference for several current issues of clinical medicine (the phenomenon of somatization, the increasing occurrence of mysterious symptoms, the demand for well-being and quality of life), including its new dialogue with mind- body and alternative medicine.

732,Training Pediatric Residents in a Primary Care Clinic to Help Address Psychosocial Problems and Prevent Child Maltreatment,"OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to determine whether 1) residents trained in the SEEK (A Safe Environment for Every Kid) model would report improved attitudes, knowledge, comfort, competence, and practice regarding screening for psychosocial risk factors (parental depression, parental substance abuse, intimate partner violence, stress, corporal punishment, and food insecurity); 2) intervention residents would be more likely to screen for and assess those risk factors; and 3) families seen by intervention residents would report improved satisfaction with their child's doctor compared to families receiving standard care from control residents.METHODS: Pediatric residents in a university-based pediatrics continuity clinic were enrolled onto a randomized controlled trial of the SEEK model. The model included resident training about psychosocial risk factors, a Parent Screening Questionnaire, and a study social worker. Outcome measures included: 1) residents' baseline, 6-month, and 18-month posttraining surveys, 2) medical record review, and 3) parents' satisfaction regarding doctor-parent interaction.RESULTS: Ninety-five residents participated. In 4 of 6 risk areas, intervention residents scored higher on the self-assessment compared to control subjects, with sustained improvement at 18 months. Intervention residents were more likely than control subjects to screen and assess parents for targeted risk factors. Parents seen by intervention residents responded favorably regarding interactions with their doctor.CONCLUSIONS: The SEEK model helped residents become more comfortable and competent in screening for and addressing psychosocial risk factors. The benefits were sustained. Parents viewed the intervention doctors favorably. The model shows promise as a way of helping address major psychosocial problems in pediatric primary care.","Feigelman, Susan; Dubowitz, Howard; Lane, Wendy; Grube, Lawrie; Kim, Jeongeun",0,,556

737,"Initial Evaluation of an Integrated Treatment for Comorbid PTSD and Smoking Using a Nonconcurrent, Multiple-Baseline Design","The present study examined an integrated treatment for comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and smoking entitled ""Smoke-Free to Overcome PTSD: An Integrated Treatment"" (STOP IT program). A nonconcurrent multiple-baseline design was used with six community-recruited adult smokers with PTSD to investigate both patient acceptance of the treatment and its initial efficacy on both PTSD and smoking. Potential order effects of exposure-based and affect management components were also examined. A gold-standard assessment strategy that included the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (Blake et al., 1995) and biochemical verification of self-reported smoking status was employed to measure primary targets of treatment. Results suggested that the STOP IT program was well tolerated. There were clinically significant improvements in PTSD outcomes, but only temporary reductions in smoking. Participants' relatively low posttreatment smoking levels increased by the follow-up assessment, although not to baseline levels. Treatment component order did not appear to affect treatment outcomes, but those who were assigned to the exposure-focused writing prior to affect management training condition appeared more likely to discontinue treatment before beginning exposure. These preliminary data support the safety, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the STOP IT program. Future investigation of the STOP IT program should include testing the incremental efficacy of increasing the dose of smoking-focused intervention, as well as randomized controlled tests of the treatment that employ gold standards for treatment outcome research.

740,Normative and counter-normative stress messages and symptom reporting: Implications for health promotion and a methodological artefact for stress research,"Objectives There is increasing use of counter-normative health messages (i.e., evidence-based health information about cause-effect relationships that run counter to shared normative beliefs, e.g., stress can lead to personal growth). The current studies examine the effect of normative and counter-normative messages about stress on levels of symptom reporting. Predictions are derived from reactance, social comparison, and self-enhancement theories. Method and design Two studies focus on the development of the messages, and two experimental studies examine the effect of manipulating normative and counter-normative messages on symptom reports. The final study controls for mere-measurement effects and explores the role of stress process variables (appraisals and coping). Results Exposure to a normative message (stress causes ill health) results in reduced symptom reporting compared to a counter-normative message (stress provides challenge, growth, and development) and control groups. The results suggest that people may use symptom reporting strategically to indicate coping. Based on the argument that beliefs about stress and health are stored as mental models, the theoretical associations derived from stress theory are only observed when a normative message is presented. Conclusions Counter-normative stress messages may carry no tangible benefits compared to normative messages. Some stress research may suffer from inherent methodological bias when normative information is provided in information and consent sheets. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? At present, nothing is known about counter-normative health messages, despite the fact that they are becoming widely used as a public intervention. What does this study add? A clear operational definition of counter-normative messages. A test of three competing theories for counter-normative messages that focus of the stress-symptom link. Demonstrating for the first time, that in the domain of stress and health, counter-normative messages are at best ineffective. Demonstrating for the first time that only when the stress-coping-symptom links are made explicit do the theoretical associations observed in the literature emerge.

Yet, it is by no means immune to some of the vagaries of client participation. Special concerns arise when clients drop out from treatment. Objective: The aim of this study was to answer questions about the rate and timing of dropout from CBT, with specific reference to pretreatment versus during treatment phases. Also explored were several moderators of dropout. Method: A meta-analysis was performed on dropout data from 115 primary empirical studies involving 20,995 participants receiving CBT for a range of mental health disorders. Results: Average weighted dropout rate was 15.9% at pretreatment, and 26.2% during treatment. Dropout was significantly associated with (a) diagnosis, with depression having the highest attrition rate; (b) format of treatment delivery, with e-therapy having the highest rates; (c) treatment setting, with fewer inpatient than outpatient dropouts; and (d) number of sessions, with treatment starters showing significantly reduced dropout as number of sessions increased. Dropout was not significantly associated with client type (adults or adolescents), therapist licensure status, study design (randomized control trial [RCT] vs. non-RCT), or publication recency. Conclusions: Findings are interpreted with reference to other reviews. Possible clinical applications include careful choice and supplementing of treatment setting/delivery according to the diagnosis, and use of preparatory strategies. Suggestions for future research include standardization of operational definitions of dropout, specification of timing of dropout, and exploration of additional moderator variables.

743,Students and teachers benefit from mindfulness-based stress reduction in a school-embedded pilot study,"Objective: There is a research gap in studies that evaluate the effectiveness of a school-embedded mindfulness-based intervention for both students and teachers. To address this gap, the present pilot study reviews relevant literature and investigates whether students and teachers who participate in separate Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) courses show improvements across a variety of psychological variables including areas of mental health and creativity. Methods: The study applied a controlled waitlist design with three measurement points. A total of 29 students (n = 15 in the intervention and n = 14 in the waitlist group) and 29 teachers (n = 14 in the intervention and n = 15 in the waitlist group) completed questionnaires before and after the MBSR course. The intervention group was also assessed after a 4-month follow-up period. Results: Relative to the control group, significant improvements in self-reported stress, self-regulation, school-specific self-efficacy and interpersonal problems were found among the students who participated in the MBSR course (p < 0.05, Cohens' d ranges from 0.62 to 0.68). Medium effect sizes on mindfulness, anxiety and creativity indicate a realistic potential in those areas. By contrast, teachers in the intervention group showed significantly higher self-reported mindfulness levels and reduced interpersonal problems compared to the control group(p < 0.05, Cohens' d = 0.66 and 0.42, respectively), with medium effect sizes on anxiety and emotion regulation. Conclusion: The present findings contribute to a growing body of studies investigating mindfulness in schools by discussing the similarities and differences in the effects of MBSR on students and teachers as well as stressing the importance of investigating interpersonal effects.

744,Preterm newborn pain research review,"This narrative review is based on a literature search of PubMed and PsycINFO for research on preterm newborn pain published during the last ten years. The high prevalence of painful procedures being performed with preterm newborns without analgesia (79%), with a median of 75 painful procedures being received during hospitalization and as many as 51 painful procedures per day highlights the importance of this problem. This review covers the pain assessments that have been developed, the short-term effects of the painful procedures, the longer-term developmental outcomes and the pharmacological and alternative therapies that have been researched. The most immediate effects reported for repeated painful procedures include increased heart rate, oxidative stress and cortisol as well as decreased vagal activity. Lower body weight and head circumference have been noted at 32 weeks gestation. Blunted cortisol reactivity to stressors has been reported for three-month-olds and thinner gray matter in 21 of 66 cerebral regions and motor and cognitive developmental delays have been noted as early as eight months. Longer-term outcomes have been reported at school age including less cortical thickness, lower vagal activity, delayed visualâ€“ perceptual development, lower IQs and internalizing behavior. Pharmacological interventions and their side effects and non-pharmacological therapies are also reviewed including sucrose, milk and nonnutritive sucking which have been effective but thought to negatively affect breast-feeding. Full-body interventions have included tucking, swaddling, kangaroo care and massage therapy. Although these have been effective for alleviating immediate pain during invasive procedures, research is lacking on the routine use of these therapies for reducing long-term pain effects. Further, additional randomized controlled replication studies are needed. Â© 2017",Field T.,0,10.1016/j.infbeh.2017.09.002,565

746,Patient Navigation for Breast and Colorectal Cancer Treatment: A Randomized Trial,"Background: There is limited high-quality evidence about the impact of patient navigation (PN) on outcomes for patients with diagnosed cancer.Methods: We pooled data from two sites from the national Patient Navigation Research Program. Patients (n = 438) with newly diagnosed breast (n = 353) or colorectal cancer (n = 85) were randomized to PN or usual care. Trained lay navigators met with patients randomized to PN to help them assess treatment barriers and identify resources to overcome barriers. We used intent-to-treat analysis to assess time to completion of primary treatment, psychologic distress (impact of events scale), and satisfaction (patient satisfaction with cancer-related care) within 3 months after initiation of cancer treatment.Results: The sample was predominantly middle-aged (mean age - 57) and female (90%); 44% were race-ethnic minorities (44%), 46% reported lower education levels, 18% were uninsured, and 9% reported a non-English primary language. The randomized groups were comparable in baseline characteristics. Primary analysis showed no statistically significant group differences in time to completion of primary cancer treatment, satisfaction with cancer-related care, or psychologic distress. Subgroup analysis showed that socially disadvantaged patients (i.e., uninsured, low English proficiency, and non-English primary language) who received PN reported higher satisfaction than those receiving usual care (all P < 0.05). Navigated patients living alone reported greater distress than those receiving usual care.Conclusions: Although the primary analysis showed no overall benefit, the subgroup analysis suggests that PN may improve satisfaction with care for certain disadvantaged individuals.Impact: PN for cancer patients may not necessarily reduce treatment time nor distress.

747,Mindfulness-based Cancer Stress Management: Impact of a mindfulness-based programme on psychological distress and quality of life,"Within the area of cancer care, mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions have been found to be efficacious in reducing psychological distress related to a cancer diagnosis; however, the impact of mindfulness-based interventions on quality of life is unclear. This study explores the impact of a Mindfulness-Based Cancer Stress Management programme on psychological distress and quality of life. Research methodology included a single-group quasi-experimental study of 26 participants experiencing distress related to a cancer diagnosis, including carers, who completed an MBCSM programme and all assessments. Participants completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General version 4 (FACT-G) and its associated spirituality index (FACIT-Sp-Ex), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI), and the Distress Thermometer at baseline, post-intervention, and three months after programme completion. Significant improvements were observed on all measures (ranges: P â‰¤ 0.001 to 0.008, r = -0.53 to -0.79) following the intervention, which were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Mindfulness was significantly correlated with all main outcome measures at post-intervention (range: r = -0.41 to 0.67) and 3-month follow-up (range: r = -0.49 to 0.73), providing evidence for the internal validity of the study. Our findings indicate that the MBCSM programme is effective in reducing psychological distress and improving quality of life, including spiritual well-being.

748,"Cognitive functioning, aging, and work: A review and recommendations for research and practice","There is a larger proportion and number of older adults in the labor force than ever before. Furthermore, older adults in the workforce are working until later ages. Although a great deal of research has examined physical health and well-being of working older adults, less research has focused on cognitive functioning. The purpose of this article is to provide a broad contemporary and multidisciplinary review of the intersection between cognitive functioning, aging, and work as a follow-up to a paper previously written by Fisher et al. (2014). We begin by providing definitions and background about cognitive functioning and how it changes over the life span. Next we discuss theories relevant to the intersection of cognitive functioning and work, including the use-it-or-lose-it hypothesis, the cognitive reserve hypothesis, hypotheses regarding environmental influences on intellectual functioning, and the job-demandsresources model. Then we summarize recent research about the effects of work on cognitive functioning, as well as ways that cognitive functioning may influence work motivation, learning, development, training, and safety. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of person-environment fit, suggesting avenues for future research, and discussing practical implications for the field of occupational health psychology.

749,Widening the circle of security: A quasi-experimental evaluation of attachment-based professional development for family child care providers,"This pilot program evaluation was undertaken to examine the effectiveness of an attachment-based, group professional-development experience, Circle of Security-Parenting, on family childcare (FCC) providers' psychological resources and self-efficacy in managing children's challenging behaviors and supporting children's socioemotional development. Licensed FCC providers with children actively in their care (n = 34) self-selected into the program, offered in English and Spanish through a regional support network for FCC providers; a comparison group of providers was recruited from the state database of licensed providers (n = 17). A significant Time Ã— Group interaction was observed for self-efficacy in managing challenging behaviors, F(1, 46) = 30.59, p = 000, partial Î·2 = 40, with participating providers' mean self-efficacy scores increasing, p = .000, d = .78, while comparison providers' decreased, p = .003, d = 1.40. Mean depressive symptoms decreased over time for both groups whereas job stress-related resources were stable over time in both groups. Patterns of association were found between providers' self-report of difficulties considering children's mental states and depressive symptoms, job stress resources, and self-efficacy. Limitations and implications for future research are reviewed, including the impact of conducting this work within an organized support network for FCC providers.

751,The need for more effective father involvement in early autism intervention: A systematic review and recommendations,"Fathers of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are underrepresented in both early intervention and research. However, fathers have unique interaction styles that make important contributions to the language and symbolic play development of typically developing children. Fathers may make similar contributions to the development of their children with ASD, who struggle with social-communicative deficits, particularly in the areas of language and symbolic play. This article provides a theoretical rationale for enhancing father-child involvement in early autism intervention that may lead to improved outcomes in child communication and symbolic play and have cascading benefits for families in reducing stress and enhancing coping mechanisms. To support this rationale, systematic reviews of the literature were conducted to (a) identify the extent of father involvement in parent training programs for children with autism, (b) identify the contributions of parents to the symbolic play outcomes of their children with ASD and other disabilities, and (c) examine differences in stress and coping experienced by mothers and fathers of children with ASD. Finally, possible barriers to father participation in early autism intervention are discussed and recommendations are offered for making parent-implemented early intervention for children with ASD more amenable to fathers.

752,Challenges and successes in dissemination of evidence-based treatments for posttraumatic stress: Lessons learned from prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) poses monumental public health challenges because of its contribution to mental health, physical health, and both interpersonal and social problems. Recent military engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan and the multitude of resulting cases of PTSD have highlighted the public health significance of these conditions. There are now psychological treatments that can effectively treat most individuals with PTSD, including active duty military personnel, veterans, and civilians. We begin by reviewing the effectiveness of these treatments, with a focus on prolonged exposure (PE), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD. Many studies conducted in independent research labs have demonstrated that PE is highly efficacious in treating PTSD across a wide range of trauma types, survivor characteristics, and cultures. Furthermore, therapists without prior CBT experience can readily learn and implement the treatment successfully. Despite the existence of highly effective treatments like PE, the majority of individuals with PTSD receive treatments of unknown efficacy. Thus, it is crucial to identify the barriers and challenges that must be addressed in order to promote the widespread dissemination of effective treatments for PTSD. In this review, we first discuss some of the major challenges, such as a professional culture that often is antagonistic to evidence-based treatments (EBTs), a lack of clinician training in EBTs, limited effectiveness of commonly used dissemination techniques, and the significant cost associated with effective dissemination models. Next, we review local, national, and international efforts to disseminate PE and similar treatments and illustrate the challenges and successes involved in promoting the adoption of EBTs in mental health systems. We then consider ways in which the barriers discussed earlier can be overcome, as well as the difficulties involved in effecting sustained organizational change in mental health systems. We also present examples of efforts to disseminate PE in developing countries and the attendant challenges when mental health systems are severely underdeveloped. Finally, we present future directions for the dissemination of EBTs for PTSD, including the use of newer technologies such as web-based therapy and telemedicine. We conclude by discussing the need for concerted action among multiple interacting systems in order to overcome existing barriers to dissemination and promote widespread access to effective treatment for PTSD. These systems include graduate training programs, government agencies, health insurers, professional organizations, healthcare delivery systems, clinical researchers, and public education systems like the media. Each of these entities can play a major role in reducing the personal suffering and public health burden associated with posttraumatic stress.

753,Psychodynamic psychotherapies: Evidence-based practice and clinical wisdom,"This article is based on an exhaustive review of the psychotherapy outcomes literature, undertaken originally at the instigation of the UK Department of Health by Roth and Fonagy (Department of Health, 1995). We have recently updated this review (Fonagy, Target, Cottrell, Phillips, & Kurtz, 2002; Roth & Fonagy, 2004) and extended it to identify all studies of psychoanalytic psychotherapy. The usual methods for identifying studies were employed (Fonagy, Target, et al., 2002; Roth & Fonagy, in press). The key questions that should be asked of this literature given the current state of research in this area (also see Westen, Morrison, & Thompson-Brenner, 2004) are: Are there any disorders for which short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) can be considered evidence-based, Are there any disorders for which STPP is uniquely effective as either the only evidence-based treatment or as a treatment that is more effective than alternatives, and Is there any evidence base for long-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (LTPP) either in terms of achieving effects not normally associated with short-term treatment or addressing problems that have not been addressed by STPP? In this context, short-term therapy is conceived of as a treatment of around 20 sessions delivered usually once weekly.

754,Soldiers' perceptions of resilience training and postdeployment adjustment: Validation of a measure of resilience training content and training process,"Group randomized trials of a resilience training program (formerly Battlemind training) demonstrated effectiveness of the program in reducing postdeployment adjustment problems among military personnel. These results are promising, but program evaluation is a dynamic, multifaceted task, and many questions remain. This article is designed to address one component of resilience training program evaluation: soldiers' perceptions of the training. Specifically, a self-report measure assessing attitudes and satisfaction in domains theorized to be important to resilience training was developed. This measure was administered to 782 soldiers who participated in a 1-hr resilience training session at 4-months postdeployment. Several mental health outcomes (e.g., alcohol problems, posttraumatic stress symptoms, physical health symptoms, unit morale) were assessed before training and 6 months later. Structural validity, internal consistency, concurrent validity, and predictive validity of the measure were examined. Analyses identified two factors reflecting attitudes toward Training Content and Training Process. The factors demonstrated good internal consistency, and both correlated with overall training satisfaction and mental health-related attitudes. In addition, both factors predicted significant positive change in a set of mental health outcomes at 6-month follow-up. Implications for postdeployment resilience training are discussed.

755,Traumatic victimization in childhood and persistent problems with oppositional-defiance,"A number of studies suggest similarities between the psychosocial impairment caused by traumatic victimization and the ""cascade"" (Patterson, 1993) of problems experienced by youths with severe and persistent problems with oppositional-defiance. Evidence indicating that traumatic victimization may be a factor in disruptive behavior disorders is reviewed. A preliminary conceptual model is proposed as a basis for clinical and research hypothesis testing concerning the potential relationship between traumatic victimization and problematic oppositional-defiance. The model postulates a chronological sequence from (a) victimization in childhood, to (b) escalating dysregulation of emotion and social information processing (""survival coping""), to (c) severe and persistent problems with oppositional-defiance and overt or covert aggression which are compounded by post-traumatic symptoms (""victim coping"").

757,Computerized cognitive behavioural therapy at work: a randomized controlled trial in employees with recent stress-related absenteeism,"Background Emotional distress has major implications for employees and employers. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a recommended treatment, but demand outstrips supply. CBT is well suited to computerization. Most employee assistance programmes have not been systematically evaluated and computerized CBT has not previously been studied in the workplace.Aims To evaluate the effect of an 8 week computerized cognitive behavioural therapy programme, 'Beating The Blues', on emotional distress in employees with recent stress-related absenteeism, and to explore the reasons for non-participation.Methods An open, randomized trial in a London NHS occupational health department. Forty-eight public sector employees, with 10 or more cumulative days stress-related absenteeism in the last 6 months, randomized equally to 'Beating The Blues' plus conventional care, or conventional care alone. Main outcome measures were Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Attributional Style Questionnaire scores at end of treatment and 1, 3 and 6 months later; and reasons for non-participation.Results At end of treatment and 1 month later, adjusted mean depression scores and adjusted mean negative attributional style scores were significantly lower in the intervention group. One month post-treatment, adjusted mean anxiety scores were also significantly lower in the intervention group. The differences were not statistically significant at 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Non-participation was common and related to access problems, preference for other treatments, time commitment, scepticism about the intervention and the employer connection.Conclusions Beating The Blues may accelerate psychological recovery in employees with recent stress-related absenteeism. Greater flexibility and accessibility might improve uptake.","Grime, PR",1,10.1093/occmed/kqh077,576
758,Groups for Trauma/Disaster,"Group interventions for survivors of trauma were first used following World War II with combat veterans struggling with the psychological consequences of their war experiences. Early groups were conducted months or years after combat, while the ensuing evolution of groups for trauma has diversified so that single-session groups are now often used to provide support for disaster survivors within the first few days or weeks after the event. From children in communities ravaged by hurricanes to female survivors of intimate partner violence, the types of trauma addressed by groups have also expanded. Reviews of studies on treatment outcome for group interventions for trauma/disaster reveal generally positive effects for group participation, regardless of the specific theoretical basis used by developers.

Many risk factors, gait related and biomechanical, have been identified, although little conclusive evidence has been found in terms of injury prevention to date.Hypothesis: Orthoses, as produced by proprietary software interpretation of plantar pressures, are able to reduce injury rates in an ""at risk'' military population.Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.Methods: Four hundred military officer trainees were assessed by means of pressure plate recording of their contact foot pressures during walking. Participants were risk assessed and randomized to receive or not receive customized orthoses using the D3D system. Both cohorts were followed up for injury through their basic training at the 7-week point.Results: The orthotic intervention group sustained 21 injuries in total (1 injury per 4666 hours of training), whereas the control group sustained 61 injuries in total (1 injury per 1600 hours of training) (P < .0001), thereby demonstrating an absolute risk reduction of 0.49 from use of the orthoses (P < .0001, chi square; confidence interval, 1.7, 2.4).Conclusion: In this military trainee population, orthoses were effective in the prevention of overuse lower limb injury. This is the first study to identify a positive preventive role of orthoses.","Franklyn-Miller, Andrew; Wilson, Cassie; Bilzon, James; McCrory, Paul",0,10.1177/0363546510382852,579
764,Fatigue in patients with diabetes: A review,"Objective: Fatigue is a common and distressing complaint among people with diabetes and likely to hinder the ability to perform daily diabetes self-management tasks. A review of the literature about diabetes-related fatigue was conducted with an eye toward creating a framework for beginning to conduct more focused studies on this subject. Methods: A literature search containing the terms diabetes, fatigue, tiredness, and symptoms was conducted to search for literature that addressed diabetes-related fatigue. Results: Diabetes presents many potential pathways for fatigue, but focused studies on this symptom are rare. Furthermore, research on diabetes-related fatigue is limited by fatigue's nonspecific symptoms and because fatigue researchers have yet to agree on standardized definition, measurement, or diagnostic criteria. Additionally, few diabetes randomized clinical trials included measurement of patient-reported outcomes, such as symptoms or health-related quality of life in their study designs, although one that did provided some meaningful finding that symptom-focused education improved self-management practices, HbA1c levels, quality of life, and symptom distress. Conclusion: There is a need to standardize the definition, measurement, and diagnostic criteria of fatigue in diabetes. We present a model that can guide focused studies on fatigue in diabetes. The model capitalizes on the multidimensional phenomena (physiological, psychological, and lifestyle) associated with fatigue in diabetes.

A recovery time of 1 week was allowed between trials. The first session was performed by subjects wearing only shorts (i.e. no fire jacket, J0). A similar protocol was applied subsequently to test the physiological effects associated with the wearing of one of five different fire jackets: one leather (J1) and four textile-type jackets: VTN(TM) with membrane (J2), VTN(TM) without membrane (J3), Vidal(TM) with Kermel(R) HTA (Haute Teneur en Aramide i.e. high density in Aramide) (J4); and Rolland(TM) with Kermel(R) HTA (J5). All sessions were performed in a randomized order and in laboratory conditions. Exercise with the fireproof jackets resulted in higher tympanic temperature (Tty), heart rate (HR) and body mass loss (BML) changes compared to J0 (p <0.001). The magnitudes of these changes depended on the type of the jacket. Exercise in the leather jacket (J1) resulted in the highest Tty and HR, which differed significantly from values in all other conditions (p <0.001). The exercise-induced increases in Tty wearing jackets J3 and J5 were also significantly (p <0.05) higher than those observed with jackets J2 and J4. In conclusion, textile jackets induced less HR and Tty stresses than the leather one. The magnitude of the physiological responses induced by textile jackets were correlated to jacket weight. J2 and J4 jackets were more effective in limiting hyperthermia and any potential detrimental effect on the exercise capacity.","Ftaiti, F; Duflot, JC; Nicol, C; Grelot, L",0,10.1080/00140130110034499,581
768,A meta-review of school-based disaster interventions for child and adolescent survivors,"Background: Children and adolescents are among the most vulnerable groups affected by natural and man-made disaster. To better understand research and practice concerning mental health and psychosocial support efforts in humanitarian settings, the authors conducted a comprehensive review of all intervention programmes within the past decade that universally targeted children and adolescents who were exposed to a natural and/or man-made disaster. Methods: We searched PubMed, PsychINFO, Cochrane Library and CINAHL for mental health and psychosocial interventions (MHPSS) involving children and adolescents. A total of 11 studies, 4 from natural disasters and 7 from conflict-affected areas met the inclusion criteria. Effect sizes were calculated using a random effects model for studies in post-natural disaster and war/terrorist-affected settings separately. Results: The weighted mean effect sizes for interventions in both settings were statistically significant: -0.308, 95% CI=-0.54- -0.07, z=-2.58, p=0.010 after a natural disaster, and -0.514, 95% CI=-0.80 to -0.23, z=-3.57, p<0.001 in conflict areas. This indicates that MHPSS interventions in both disaster settings resulted in a reduction in PTSD symptoms compared to the control. Conclusions: This review suggests that school-based, universal programmes that are conducted by teachers or local paraprofessionals are effective in reducing PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents. The few studies meeting the inclusion criteria of this study demonstrate the need for further expansion of statistical methods and study designs to test for the effects of interventions in challenging humanitarian settings.

770,Effect of communication skills training on nurses' detection of patients' distress and related factors after cancer diagnosis: A randomized study,"Background: A randomized study was performed to investigate whether a communication skill (CS) training program can improve nurse's ability to detect the distress of patients who have just been informed of cancer diagnosis. Methods: Nurses were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group, and those in the former group had undergone CS training program. Nurses in both groups were then requested to support patients informed of their cancer diagnosis. Intervention consisted of one-on-one nurse interviews 3 times (on the day, 1 week, and 1 month after diagnosis). Patient's self-reported distress according to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and nurse's ratings of patient distress by Visual Analog Scale were assessed 3 times (1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after diagnosis). These two scales were compared between the nurses of the two groups to assess the impact of CS training. Results: The nurses in the experimental and control groups supported 42 and 47 patients, respectively. The analysis using mixed-effects modeling revealed no significant differences in the nurse's ability to detect patient's distress between the two groups. However, when the nurse's ratings of patient's distress and patient's self-reported distress were compared, these two scores were significantly correlated only with the nurses in the experimental group, suggesting that the nurse's ability to become aware of patient's distress had been improved in that group.

771,Functional somatic syndromes and childhood physical abuse in women: Data from a representative community-based sample,"This study investigated whether childhood physical abuse was associated with functional somatic syndromes (FSS) in women while controlling for age, race, and four clusters of potentially confounding factors: (a) Other childhood adversities, (b) adult health behaviors, (c) socioeconomic status and stressors, and (d) mental health. A regional subsample of the 2005 Canadian Community Health Survey of 7,342 women was used. Women reported whether they had been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), fibromyalgia (Fm), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), or multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS). Fully 749 reported having been physically abused by someone close to them during their youth. When controlling for potentially confounding factors, childhood physical abuse was significantly associated with CFS (OR = 2.11; 95% CI = 1.22, 3.65), Fm (OR = 1.65; 95% CI = 1.08, 2.52), and MCS (OR = 2.82; 95% = CI 1.90, 4.17). Clinicians using reattribution and stepped care approaches in the management of FSS should assess for a history of abuse.

773,"Specialist palliative care services for adults with advanced, incurable illness in hospital, hospice, or community settings--protocol for a systematic review.","BACKGROUND: Specialist palliative care (SPC) interventions aim to relieve and prevent suffering in the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domain. Therefore, SPC is carried out by a multi-professional team with different occupations (e.g., physician, nurse, psychologist, and social worker). Remaining skepticism concerning the need for SPC may be based on the scarcity of high-quality evaluations about the external evidence for SPC. Therefore, we will conduct a systematic review according to Cochrane standards to examine the effects of SPC for adults with advanced illness.METHODS/DESIGN: The comprehensive systematic literature search will include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs. We will search the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and PsycINFO. Patients must be adults suffering from life-limiting diseases. Proxy and caregiver outcomes will not be assessed in order to ensure a clear and well-defined research question for this review. Interventions may be in an in- or outpatient setting, e.g., consulting service, palliative care ward, and palliative outpatient clinic. In line with the multi-dimensional scope of palliative care, the primary outcome is quality of life (QoL). Key secondary outcomes are patients' symptom burden, place of death and survival, and health economic aspects. Subgroup analysis will assess results according to cancer type, age, early vs not early SPC, site of care, and setting. Analysis will be performed with the current RevMan software. We will use the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias assessment tool. The quality of evidence will be judged according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.DISCUSSION: The available evidence will be summarized and discussed to provide a basis for decision-making among health care professionals and policy makers. For SPC, we believe that multi-professional care is of utmost importance. Therefore, single-profession interventions such as physician consultations will not be included. Based on the multi-dimensional scope of palliative care, we chose QoL as the primary outcome, despite an expected heterogeneity among the QoL outcomes. We consider unidimensional endpoints such as ""pain"" for the physical domain to be inadequate for capturing the true scope of (S)PC (i.e., QoL) as defined by the World Health Organization.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42015020674.","Gaertner, Jan; Siemens, Waldemar; Antes, Gerd; Meerpohl, Joerg J; Xander, Carola; Schwarzer, Guido; Stock, Stephanie; Becker, Gerhild",0,10.1186/s13643-015-0121-4,585
774,Circadian rhythms as a basis for work organization: A study with live line electricians,"Objective: With the assumption that circadian rhythms influence human performance, the work of live line electricians was reorganized and evaluated. The hypothesis was that in highly physical and attentiondemanding work, the organization of tasks, according to the ideal period of day and day of week, should diminish stress and consequent work risks. Background: There are only a few studies reporting the work of electricians and even fewer approaching work organization. Moreover, these investigations often do not consider human physiological limitations and capabilities as well as task demands. Method: A new work system was proposed with consideration of (a) the circadian cycles and homeostatic processes; (b) the effect of heat, which is a zeitgeber (synchronizer) for the biological clocks; and (c) the degree of physical and mental demands of the different performed tasks, which was assessed on the basis of opinions of the electricians and physiological markers of stress that are controlled by circadian rhythms. The traditional and new systems were compared on the basis of two cognitive indices (the arrangement of matchsticks and the perception of a minute) and three physiological markers of mental-to-physical loads (heart frequency and the level of adrenaline and noradrenaline). Results: Both physical and mental loads were reduced in the new system. Conclusion: Work organization should include consideration of human circadian rhythms, mainly when stressful and high-risk tasks are involved. Application: The findings can be applied in any work design, but they are especially suited for highly demanding work carried out outdoors.

775,Experiential Virtual Scenarios With Real-Time Monitoring (Interreality) for the Management of Psychological Stress: A Block Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: The recent convergence between technology and medicine is offering innovative methods and tools for behavioral health care. Among these, an emerging approach is the use of virtual reality (VR) within exposure-based protocols for anxiety disorders, and in particular posttraumatic stress disorder. However, no systematically tested VR protocols are available for the management of psychological stress.Objective: Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of a new technological paradigm, Interreality, for the management and prevention of psychological stress. The main feature of Interreality is a twofold link between the virtual and the real world achieved through experiential virtual scenarios (fully controlled by the therapist, used to learn coping skills and improve self-efficacy) with real-time monitoring and support (identifying critical situations and assessing clinical change) using advanced technologies (virtual worlds, wearable biosensors, and smartphones).Methods: The study was designed as a block randomized controlled trial involving 121 participants recruited from two different worker populations-teachers and nurses-that are highly exposed to psychological stress. Participants were a sample of teachers recruited in Milan (Block 1: n=61) and a sample of nurses recruited in Messina, Italy (Block 2: n=60). Participants within each block were randomly assigned to the (1) Experimental Group (EG): n=40; B1=20, B2=20, which received a 5-week treatment based on the Interreality paradigm; (2) Control Group (CG): n=42; B1=22, B2=20, which received a 5-week traditional stress management training based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); and (3) the Wait-List group (WL): n=39, B1=19, B2=20, which was reassessed and compared with the two other groups 5 weeks after the initial evaluation.Results: Although both treatments were able to significantly reduce perceived stress better than WL, only EG participants reported a significant reduction (EG=12% vs CG=0.5%) in chronic ""trait"" anxiety. A similar pattern was found for coping skills: both treatments were able to significantly increase most coping skills, but only EG participants reported a significant increase (EG=14% vs CG=0.3%) in the Emotional Support skill.Conclusions: Our findings provide initial evidence that the Interreality protocol yields better outcomes than the traditionally accepted gold standard for psychological stress treatment: CBT. Consequently, these findings constitute a sound foundation and rationale for the importance of continuing future research in technology-enhanced protocols for psychological stress management.","Gaggioli, Andrea; Pallavicini, Federica; Morganti, Luca; Serino, Silvia; Scaratti, Chiara; Briguglio, Marilena; Crifaci, Giulia; Vetrano, Noemi; Giulintano, Annunziata; Bernava, Giuseppe; Tartarisco, Gennaro; Pioggia, Giovanni; Raspelli, Simona; Cipresso, Pietro; Vigna, Cinzia; Grassi, Alessandra; Baruffi, Margherita; Wiederhold, Brenda; Riva, Giuseppe",0,10.2196/jmir.3235,587
776,Perception of breast cancer risk and psychological distress in women attending a surveillance program,"Women at high risk of developing breast cancer who attend surveillance programs (SP) overestimate their risk and are highly anxious; those who are anxious are less likely to perform breast self-examination (BSE). We attempted to determine if counseling by a breast surgeon could increase women's accuracy of risk perception and hence decrease their anxiety and increase their likelihood of performing BSE. We also tested the efficacy of a series of four informative newsletters in reducing anxiety. All 145 women who scheduled an initial appointment during one year for our SP were asked to participate; 94 women completed a self-report questionnaire containing validated instruments before their first SP visit. Of these, 41 women were randomly selected to receive the newsletter. Women were mailed follow-up questionnaires at 2 and 4 months after their initial visit. Of the sample, 76% overestimated their risk of developing breast cancer by at least doubling their actual risk as measured with empiric risk tables. Their psychological distress was between 0.5 to 1 standard deviation above normative scores. Being older and having greater confidence in the ability to perform BSE were the only variables that predicted performance of BSE. A follow-up assessment performed 4 months after the initial visit showed a significant improvement in the accuracy of perception of risk (p < 0.01) and a reduction of cancer anxiety (p < 0.05), but no significant change in performance of BSE. The newsletters produced no significant effect. Women attending a breast surveillance program showed a significant improvement in their ability to estimate the risk of developing breast cancer and a reduction in their anxiety after counseling, but no significant change in performance of BSE. The possibility that improvement in risk perception and reduction of cancer anxiety can lead to greater adherence to screening behaviors needs to be tested with a larger number of women and over a longer time period.","Gagnon P., Massie M.J., Kash K.M., Gronert M., Heerdt A.S., Brown K., Sullivan M.D., Borgen P.",0,10.1002/(SICI)1099-1611(199609)5:3<259::AID-PON204>3.0.CO;2-O,588
778,Yoga for stress reduction and injury prevention at work,"At work employees face numerous psychological stressors that can undermine their work performance. These stressors, stemming from a variety of possible causes, have enormous health and financial impacts on employees as well as employers. Stress has been shown to be one of the factors leading to musculo-skeletal disorders (MSDs) such as: include back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, shoulder or neck tension, eye strain, or headaches. Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that can reduce stress and relieve muscular tension or pain. Practicing yoga at the workplace teaches employees to use relaxation techniques to reduce stress and risks of injury on the job. Yoga at the workplace is a convenient and practical outlet that improves work performance by relieving tension and job stress.",Gura Taylor S.,1,,589
780,A stress management programme for Crohn's disease,"The present study was designed to assess the effectiveness of techniques of behavioural assessment and treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). On the assumption that stress events have a pronounced influence on the life of Crohn's patients, we proposed stress management treatment. This is intended to control stress and improve patients' personal and social competence. Forty-five patients with Crohn's disease were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, two experimental groups: stress management and self-directed stress management, and a control group: conventional medical treatment. The subjects underwent eight individual sessions which were specific to each condition. All subjects completed symptom monitoring diaries. The subjects who received training in stress management experienced a significant post-treatment reduction of tiredness (P<0.1), constipation (P<0.1), abdominal pain (P<0.5) and distended abdomen (P<0.5). The subjects who received training in self-directed stress management experienced a significant reduction in tiredness (P<0.1) and abdominal pain (P<0.5). No significant changes were observed in symptomatology in the conventional medical treatment group. Similar results were obtained in the 12 month follow-up. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors randomly assigned 71 employees to a training group (n = 35) or a waiting-list control group (n = 36). As hypothesized, time management training led to an increase in perceived control of time and a decrease in perceived stress. Time management training had no impact on different performance indicators. In particular, the authors explored the use and the perceived usefulness of the techniques taught. Participants judged the taught techniques as useful, but there were large differences concerning the actual use of the various techniques.

Applications of 2-D and 3-D biomechanical models to estimate compressive force on the low back, the strength requirements of jobs, application of guidelines for overhead work and application of strain index and threshold limit value to address distal upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders are presented. Several case studies applied in the railroad industry, manufacturing, healthcare and warehousing are presented. Finally, future developments needed for improved biomechanical applications in industry are discussed. The information presented will be of value to practising ergonomists to recognise how biomechanics has played a significant role in identifying causes of musculoskeletal disorders and controlling them in the workplace. In particular, the information presented will help practising ergonomists with how physical stresses can be objectively quantified.","Garg, Arun; Kapellusch, Jay M.",0,10.1080/00140130802480794,592
784,Long-Term Efficacy of an Ergonomics Program That Includes Patient-Handling Devices on Reducing Musculoskeletal Injuries to Nursing Personnel,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term efficacy of an ergonomics program that included patient-handling devices in six long-term care facilities (LTC) and one chronic care hospital (CCH).Background: Patient handling is recognized as a major source of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among nursing personnel, and several studies have demonstrated effectiveness of patient-handling devices in reducing those MSDs. However, most studies have been conducted in a single facility, for a short period, and/or without a comprehensive ergonomics program.Method: Patient-handling devices along with a comprehensive ergonomics program was implemented in six LTC facilities and one CCH. Pre- and post-intervention injury data were collected for 38.9 months (range = 29 to 54 months) and 51.2 months (range = 36 to 60 months), respectively.Results: Postintervention patient-handling injuries decreased by 59.8% (rate ratio [RR] = 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.28, 0.49], p < .001), lost workdays by 86.7% (RR = 0.16, 95% CI [0.13, 0.18], p < .001), modified-duty days by 78.8% (RR = 0.25, 95% CI [0.22, 0.28], p < .001), and workers' compensation costs by 90.6% (RR = 0.12, 95% CI [0.09, 0.15], p < .001). Perceived stresses to low back and shoulders among nursing staff were fairly low. A vast majority of patients found the devices comfortable and safe. Longer transfer times with the use of devices was not an issue.Conclusion: Implementation of patient-handling devices along with a comprehensive program can be effective in reducing MSDs among nursing personnel. Strategies to expand usage of patient-handling devices in most health care settings should be explored.","Garg, Arun; Kapellusch, Jay M.",0,10.1177/0018720812438614,593
785,Mindfulness Research in Social Work: Conceptual and Methodological Recommendations,"Mindfulness refers to a set of practices as well as the psychological state and trait produced by such practices. The state, trait, and practice of mindfulness may be broadly characterized by a present-oriented, nonjudgmental awareness of cognitions, emotions, sensations, and perceptions without fixation on thoughts of past or future. Research on mindfulness has proliferated over the past decade. Given the explosion of scientific interest in this topic, mindfulness-based therapies are attracting the attention of clinical social workers, who seek to implement these interventions in numerous practice settings. Concomitantly, research on mindfulness is now falling within the scope and purview of social work scholars. In response to the growing interest in mindfulness within academic social work, the present article outlines six conceptual and methodological recommendations for the conduct of future empirical studies on mindfulness. These recommendations have practical importance for advancing mindfulness research within and beyond social work.","Garland, Eric L.",0,10.1093/swr/svt038,594
789,"Posttraumatic stress disorder in veterans and military personnel: Epidemiology, screening, and case recognition","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that affects 7-8% of the general U.S. population at some point during their lifetime; however, the prevalence is much higher among certain subgroups, including active duty military personnel and veterans. In this article, we review the empirical literature on the epidemiology and screening of PTSD in military and veteran populations, including the availability of sensitive and reliable screening tools. Although estimates vary across studies, evidence suggests that the prevalence of PTSD in deployed U.S. military personnel may be as high as 14-16%. Prior studies have identified trauma characteristics and pre- and posttrauma factors that increase risk of PTSD among veterans and military personnel. This information may help to inform prevention and screening efforts, as screening programs could be targeted to high-risk populations. Large-scale screening efforts have recently been implemented by the U.S. Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs. Given the prevalence and potential consequences of PTSD among veterans and active duty military personnel, development and continued evaluation of effective screening methods is an important public health need.

790,Effects of a process-based cognitive training intervention for patients with stress-related exhaustion,"Stress-related exhaustion has been linked to a pattern of selective cognitive impairments, mainly affecting executive functioning, attention and episodic memory. Little is known about potential treatments of these cognitive deficits. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a process-based cognitive training intervention, designed to target the specific cognitive impairments associated with stress-related exhaustion. To this end, patients diagnosed with exhaustion disorder (ED) were randomized to either a multimodal stress rehabilitation program with the addition of a process-based cognitive training intervention (training group, n = 27) or a treatment-as-usual control condition, consisting of multimodal stress rehabilitation with no additional training (control group, n = 32). Treatment effects were evaluated through an extensive cognitive test battery, assessing both near and far transfer effects, as well as self-report forms regarding subjective cognitive complaints and burnout levels. Results showed pronounced training-related improvements on the criterion updating task (p < 0.001). Further, evidence was found of selective near transfer effects to updating (p = 0.01) and episodic memory (p = 0.04). Also, the trained group reported less subjective memory complaints (p = 0.02) and levels of burnout decreased for both groups, but more so for the trained group (p = 0.04), following the intervention. These findings suggest that process-based cognitive training may be a viable method to address the cognitive impairments associated with ED.

791,Suppressor effects in coping research with african american adolescents from low-income communities,"Objective: The purpose of the current study was to demonstrate the replicable nature of statistical suppressor effects in coping research through 2 examples with African American adolescents from low-income communities. Method: Participants in the 1st example included 497 African American adolescents (mean age = 12.61 years, SD = 0.99; 57 female) reporting on dispositional coping, and participants in the 2nd example included 268 African American adolescents (mean age = 12.90 years, SD = 1.27; 56 female) reporting on situation-based coping. Participants in both samples completed self-report measures of coping strategies (Children's Coping Strategies Checklist and How I Coped Under Pressure Scale) and internalizing symptoms (Youth Self-Report, Children's Depression Inventory, and Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale). Results: The results of structural equation modeling revealed significant suppressor effects, with active coping and support-seeking coping enhancing the association between avoidant coping and internalizing symptoms. Conclusions: The demonstration of replicable suppressor effects helps to advance coping research and intervention by providing evidence of the interdependence of coping strategies, thus increasing understanding of how coping strategies work together to predict outcomes. The current study offers recommendations for understanding associations among coping strategies within the context of suppression effects.

792,Does military service damage females? An analysis of medical discharge data in the British armed forces,"There is anecdotal and some scientific evidence that females in military service experience an excess of work-related injuries, compared with males. To investigate this more fully, we analysed data collected routinely by the Defence Analytical Services Agency on medical discharges in male and female personnel in the British armed forces. We found that for all disease and injury categories of medical discharge there is a statistically significant excess in females; this disparity is particularly marked for discharges on account of injury [relative risk (RR) = 1.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.30-2.10] and musculoskeletal disease (RR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.75-4.06). Royal Navy females are eight times more likely (RR = 7.92, 95% CI = 3.03-20.66) and Army females seven times more likely (RR = 6.53, 95% CI = 2.60-16.42) than Royal Air Force females to be medically discharged on account of injury. Over the period 1993-1996, there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of medical discharge for both musculoskeletal disease and injury in female personnel in the British armed forces. During the period 1996-2000, a marked gender differential was maintained, but the rate of increase in females reached a plateau. We concur with previous investigators that mixed-sex training imposes particular ergonomic stresses on females and that it is a major risk factor for overuse injury. We discuss other possible explanations for the marked gender differential in medical discharge rates in the military. Some changes to training programmes are now being introduced to correct this health inequality, but further interventions are needed. Modifications to training programmes must be audited systematically and candidate interventions tested through randomized controlled trials.","Geary, KG; Irvine, D; Croft, AM",0,10.1093/occmed/52.2.85,598
793,Placebo-controlled comparison of prazosin and cognitive-behavioral treatments for sleep disturbances in US Military Veterans,"Objective: Pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments targeting insomnia and nightmares have been shown to be effective in the treatment of military veterans with sleep complaints comorbid with symptoms of stress-related disorders, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), but the two approaches have not been directly compared. This randomized controlled trial compared the effects of prazosin vs. a behavioral sleep intervention (BSI), targeting nightmares and insomnia against a placebo pill control condition on sleep and daytime symptoms. Methods: Fifty United States military veterans (mean age 40.9. years, SD = 13.2. years) with chronic sleep disturbances were randomized to prazosin (n= 18), BSI (n= 17), or placebo (n= 15). Each intervention lasted 8. weeks. Participants completed self-report measures of insomnia severity, sleep quality, and sleep disturbances. All kept a sleep diary throughout the intervention period. Polysomnographic studies were conducted pre- and post-intervention. Results: Both active treatment groups showed greater reductions in insomnia severity and daytime PTSD symptom severity. Sleep improvements were found in 61.9% of those who completed the active treatments and 25% of those randomized to placebo. Conclusion: BSI and prazosin were both associated with significant sleep improvements and reductions in daytime PTSD symptoms in this sample of military veterans. Sleep-focused treatments may enhance the benefits of first-line PTSD treatments.

794,Treatment for insomnia in combat-exposed OEF/OIF/OND Military Veterans: Preliminary randomized controlled trial,"Chronic insomnia is highly prevalent among military personnel returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. We evaluated the effects of a military version of a brief behavioral treatment of insomnia (BBTI-MV) compared to an information only control (IC) condition in combat-exposed Veterans of Operations Enduring/Iraqi Freedom or Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND) on insomnia, sleep quality, and daytime symptoms of anxiety and depression. Forty OEF/OIF/OND Veterans (Mean age=38.4 years old, s.d.=11.69; 85% men; 77.5% white) were randomized to one of two conditions. BBTI-MV consisted of two in-person sessions and two telephone contacts delivered over four weeks, and included personalized recommendations to reduce insomnia. The IC condition also consisted of 2 in-person sessions two telephone contacts delivered over four weeks, and Veterans were encouraged to read written information about sleep-promoting behaviors. The Insomnia Severity Index, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PTSD Checklist, and Beck Depression and Anxiety Inventories were completed at baseline, post-treatment, and at the six-month follow-up. Both interventions were associated with clinically significant improvements in insomnia, although the magnitude of improvements in sleep and rates of treatment response and remission were greater for BBTI-MV compared to IC from pre- to post-treatment. Both BBTI-MV and the provision of information were associated with clinically significant improvements in insomnia among Veterans. Despite the preliminary nature of the findings and limitations inherent to small controlled trials, the findings suggest that both approaches may provide viable options in a stepped-care approach to the treatment of insomnia in retuning combat-exposed Veterans.

796,Neuroendocrine responses of healthy volunteers to 'techno-music': Relationships with personality traits and emotional state,"A variety of studies reported psychological and physiological effects of music. Different types of music have been found to induce different neuroendocrine changes. The aim of the present experiment was to investigate the possible combination of emotional and endocrine changes in response to techno-music and to define personality variables as predictors of respective changes. Sixteen psychosomatically healthy subjects (18- to 19-year-olds, eight males and eight females) were exposed, in random order, to techno-music or to classical music (30 min each). Plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EPI), growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) cortisol (CORT), Î²-endorphin (Î²-EP) concentrations and changes of emotional state were measured in basal conditions and after the experimental trials with two different types of music. Techno-music was associated with a significant increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure and significant changes in self-rated emotional states. A significant increase was observed in Î²-EP, ACTH, NE, GH and CORT after listening to techno-music. Classical music induced an improvement in emotional state, but no significant changes in hormonal concentrations. No differences between male and female subjects' responses to music have been found. Plasma levels of PRL and EPI were unaffected by techno- and classical music. Changes in emotional state and NE, Î²-EP and GH responses to techno-music correlated negatively with harm avoidance scores and positively with the novelty-seeking temperament score on the Cloninger scale. Listening to techno-music induces changes in neurotransmitters, peptides and hormonal reactions, related to mental state and emotional involvement: personality traits and temperament may influence the wide inter-individual variability in response to music.","Gerra G., Zaimovic A., Franchini D., Palladino M., Giucastro G., Reali N., Maestri D., Caccavari R., Delsignore R., Brambilla F.",0,10.1016/S0167-8760(97)00071-8,602

Assessments of PTSD and comorbid conditions were made 1 week before treatment, after treatment session 4, upon termination of treatment (16 sessions), and at follow-up 3 months later. As expected, no significant differences between groups were observed at pretest or at session 4. At posttest and at follow-up, BEP had produced significant improvement in PTSD, in work resumption, and in some comorbid conditions.","Gersons B.P.R., Carlier I.V.E., Lamberts R.D., Van Der Kolk B.A.",0,10.1023/A:1007793803627,604
799,"The differential role of pain, work characteristics and pain-related fear in explaining back pain and sick leave in occupational settings","This cross-sectional questionnaire study investigated the role of pain (pain severity, radiating pain), work characteristics (physical workload, job stressors, job satisfaction), negative affect and pain-related fear in accounting for low back pain (LBP) and sick leave (SL) in 1294 employees from 10 companies in Belgium and the Netherlands. An increased risk for short-term LBP (1-30 days during the last year) was observed for workers reporting high physical workload (OR=2.39), high task exertion (OR=1.63) and high negative affect (OR=1.03). For prolonged LBP (>30 days during the last year) severe pain (OR=13.03), radiating pain (OR=2.37) and fear of work-related activities (OR=3.17) were significant risk factors. A lack of decision latitude decreased the risk of long-term LBP (OR=0.39). Short-term SL (1-30 days during the last year) was associated with severe pain (OR=2.83), high physical workload (OR=2.99) and high fear of movement/(re)injury (OR=1.88). A lack of decision latitude increased the risk of short-term SL (OR=1.92). Long-term SL (>30 days during the last year) was associated with radiating pain (OR=3.80) and high fear of movement/(re)injury (OR=6.35). A lack of co-worker support reduced the risk of long-term SL (OR=0.27). These results suggest that physical load factors are relatively more important in the process leading to short-term LBP and short-term SL, whereas job stressors, severe pain, radiation, and pain-related fear are more important in determining the further course and maintenance of the inability to work. The potential implications of these findings for primary and secondary prevention, and occupational rehabilitation are discussed. Â© 2004 International Association for the Study of Pain.

800,Dialectical behaviour therapy-informed skills training for deliberate self-harm: A controlled trial with 3-month follow-up data,"Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment for deliberate self-harm (DSH) and emerging evidence suggests DBT skills training alone may be a useful adaptation of the treatment. DBT skills are presumed to reduce maladaptive efforts to regulate emotional distress, such as DSH, by teaching adaptive methods of emotion regulation. However, the impact of DBT skills training on DSH and emotion regulation remains unclear.This study examined the Living Through Distress (LTD) programme, a DBT-informed skills group provided in an inpatient setting. Eighty-two adults presenting with DSH or Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) were offered places in LTD, in addition to their usual care. A further 21 clients on the waiting list for LTD were recruited as a treatment-as-usual (TAU) group. DSH, anxiety, depression, and emotion regulation were assessed at baseline and either post-intervention or 6 week follow-up.Greater reductions in the frequency of DSH and improvements in some aspects of emotion regulation were associated with completion of LTD, as compared with TAU. Improvements in DSH were maintained at 3 month follow-up. This suggests providin. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Gibson J., Booth R., Davenport J., Keogh K., Owens T.",0,10.1016/j.brat.2014.06.007,606
802,"Sleep disturbances, TBI and PTSD: Implications for treatment and recovery","Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), and sleep problems significantly affect recovery and functional status in military personnel and Veterans returning from combat. Despite recent attention, sleep is understudied in the Veteran population. Few treatments and rehabilitation protocols target sleep, although poor sleep remains at clinical levels and continues to adversely impact functioning even after the resolution of PTSD or mild TBI symptoms. Recent developments in non-pharmacologic sleep treatments have proven efficacious as stand-alone interventions and have potential to improve treatment outcomes by augmenting traditional behavioral and cognitive therapies. This review discusses the extensive scope of work in the area of sleep as it relates to TBI and PTSD, including pathophysiology and neurobiology of sleep; existing and emerging treatment options; as well as methodological issues in sleep measurements for TBI and PTSD. Understanding sleep problems and their role in the development and maintenance of PTSD and TBI symptoms may lead to improvement in overall treatment outcomes while offering a non-stigmatizing entry in mental health services and make current treatments more comprehensive by helping to address a broader spectrum of difficulties.

804,Women in recovery from PTSD have similar inflammation and quality of life as non-traumatized controls,"Objective: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with greater concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers as well as substantial medical burden; however, it is not clear if these morbidity risks change following recovery from PTSD. In this study we compare women who have recovered from PTSD, to those with current PTSD, and healthy controls on their perceived health and inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers. Methods: We studied 3 groups of women: those with current PTSD, those who reported recovery from PTSD, and healthy non-traumatized controls, which were determined using standard diagnostic instruments. We obtained a morning blood sample and examined concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers of: interleukin 6 (IL-6) and c-reactive protein (CRP), and lipid concentrations. Lastly, we evaluated health related quality of life (HRQOL). Results: Women who had recovered from PTSD had a similar HRQOL and inflammatory biomarkers as non-traumatized controls. Their concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers were lower than women with current PTSD, and similar to non-traumatized controls. Conclusion: Health perception as well as biological indicators of health significantly differ in women in recovery from PTSD, compared to those who remain symptomatic. These findings suggest that the psychological recovery is associated with normal levels of inflammatory biomarkers and HRQOL.

805,Interventions for prevention of bullying in the workplace,"BackgroundBullying has been identified as one of the leading workplace stressors, with adverse consequences for the individual employee, groups of employees, and whole organisations. Employees who have been bullied have lower levels of job satisfaction, higher levels of anxiety and depression, and are more likely to leave their place of work. Organisations face increased risk of skill depletion and absenteeism, leading to loss of profit, potential legal fees, and tribunal cases. It is unclear to what extent these risks can be addressed through interventions to prevent bullying.ObjectivesTo explore the effectiveness of workplace interventions to prevent bullying in the workplace.Search methodsWe searched: the Cochrane Work Group Trials Register (August 2014); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; TheCochrane Library 2016, issue 1); PUBMED(1946 to January 2016); EMBASE (1980 to January 2016); PsycINFO(1967 to January 2016); Cumulative Index to Nursing and AlliedHealth Literature (CINAHL Plus; 1937 to January 2016); International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS; 1951 to January 2016); Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA; 1987 to January 2016); ABI Global (earliest record to January 2016); Business Source Premier (BSP; earliest record to January 2016); OpenGrey (previously known as OpenSIGLE-System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe; 1980 to December 2014); and reference lists of articles.Selection criteriaRandomised and cluster-randomised controlled trials of employee-directed interventions, controlled before and after studies, and interrupted time-series studies of interventions of any type, aimed at preventing bullying in the workplace, targeted at an individual employee, a group of employees, or an organisation.Data collection and analysisThree authors independently screened and selected studies. We extracted data from included studies on victimisation, perpetration, and absenteeism associated with workplace bullying. We contacted study authors to gather additional data. We used the internal validity items from the Downs and Black quality assessment tool to evaluate included studies' risk of bias.Main resultsFive studies met the inclusion criteria. They had altogether 4116 participants. They were underpinned by theory and measured behaviour change in relation to bullying and related absenteeism. The included studies measured the effectiveness of interventions on the number of cases of self-reported bullying either as perpetrator or victim or both. Some studies referred to bullying using common synonyms such as mobbing and incivility and antonyms such as civility.Organisational/employer level interventionsTwo studies with 2969 participants found that the Civility, Respect, and Engagement in the Workforce (CREW) intervention produced a small increase in civility that translates to a 5% increase from baseline to follow-up, measured at 6 to 12 months (mean difference (MD) 0.17; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.28).One of the two studies reported that the CREW intervention produced a small decrease in supervisor incivility victimisation (MD -0.17; 95% CI -0.33 to -0.01) but not in co-worker incivility victimisation (MD -0.08; 95% CI -0.22 to 0.08) or in self-reported incivility perpetration (MD -0.05 95% CI -0.15 to 0.05). The study did find a decrease in the number of days absent during the previous month (MD -0.63; 95% CI -0.92 to -0.34) at 6-month follow-up.Individual/job interface level interventionsOne controlled before-after study with 49 participants compared expressive writing with a control writing exercise at two weeks followup. Participants in the intervention arm scored significantly lower on bullying measured as incivility perpetration (MD -3.52; 95% CI -6.24 to -0.80). There was no difference in bullying measured as incivility victimisation (MD -3.30 95% CI -6.89 to 0.29).One controlled before-after study with 60 employees who had learning disabilities compared a cognitive-behavioural intervention with no intervention. There was no significant difference in bullying victimisation after the intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.55; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.25), or at the three-month follow-up (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.15), nor was there a significant difference in bullying perpetration following the intervention (RR 0.64; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.54), or at the three-month follow-up (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.81).Multilevel InterventionsA five-site cluster-RCT with 1041 participants compared the effectiveness of combinations of policy communication, stress management training, and negative behaviours awareness training. The authors reported that bullying victimisation did not change (13.6% before intervention and 14.3% following intervention). The authors reported insufficient data for us to conduct our own analysis.Due to high risk of bias and imprecision, we graded the evidence for all outcomes as very low quality.Authors' conclusionsThere is very low quality evidence that organisational and individual interventions may prevent bullying behaviours in the workplace. We need large well-designed controlled trials of bullying prevention interventions operating on the levels of society/policy, organisation/employer, job/task and individual/job interface. Future studies should employ validated and reliable outcome measures of bullying and a minimum of 6 months follow-up.","Gillen, Patricia A.; Sinclair, Marlene; Kernohan, W.

806,"Using prophylactic antioxidants to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in young adults: a protocol for a double-blind, randomized controlled trial","Background: During leisure activities young people are often exposed to excessive noise levels resulting in an increase of noise-induced symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus and hyperacusis. Noise-induced tinnitus is often perceived after loud music exposure and provides an important marker for overexposure as a temporary threshold shift that is often not experienced by the individual itself. As oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of noise-induced hearing loss, the use of antioxidants to prevent hearing damage has recently become the subject of research.Methods: This study proposes a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial to assess the effects of a prophylactic combination of N-acetylcysteine (600 mg) and magnesium (200 mg) prior to leisure noise exposure in young adults. The primary outcome measure is the tinnitus loudness scored by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures are the differences in audiological measurements for the antioxidant treatments compared to placebo intake. Audiological testing comprising of pure tone audiometry including frequencies up to 16 kHz, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions and speech-in-noise testing will be performed prior to and within 7 hours after noise exposure. By use of a mixed effects statistical model, the effects of antioxidants compared to placebo intake will be assessed.Discussion: As adolescents and young adults often do not use hearing protection while being exposed to loud music, the use of preventive antioxidant intake may provide a useful and harmless way to prevent noise-induced hearing damage in this population. Furthermore, when exposed to hazardous noise levels the protection provided by hearing protectors might not be sufficient to prevent hearing damage and antioxidants may provide additive otoprotective effects. Previous research mainly focused on occupational noise exposure. The present study provides a protocol to assess the usefulness of antioxidants during leisure noise activities.","Gilles, Annick; Ihtijarevic, Berina; Wouters, Kristien; Van de Heyning, Paul",0,10.1186/1745-6215-15-110,610
808,Promoting Stress Management and Wellbeing in Educators: Feasibility and Efficacy of a School-Based Yoga and Mindfulness Intervention,"We evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of the Community Approach to Learning Mindfully (CALM) program for educators. CALM is a brief daily school-based intervention to promote educator social-emotional competencies, stress management, and wellbeing. Two middle schools were randomly assigned to waitlist control condition or the CALM program. Participants included 64 educators. Intervention sessions included gentle yoga and mindfulness practices and were offered 4Â days per week for 16Â weeks. Pre- and posttest measurements included self-report surveys of social-emotional functioning and wellbeing, blood pressure readings, and diurnal assays of cortisol. Compared to the control condition, CALM had significant benefits for educatorsâ€™ mindfulness, positive affect, classroom management, distress tolerance, physical symptoms, blood pressure, and cortisol awakening response. There were trend-level effects for two measures related to stress and burnout. No impacts were observed for relational trust, perceived stress, or sleep. Effect sizes for significant impacts ranged from 0.52 to 0.80. Educators found the intervention feasible and beneficial as a method for managing stress and promoting wellbeing. Initial evidence suggests that CALM has potential as a strategy to improve educatorsâ€™ social-emotional competence and wellbeing, prevent stress-related problems, and support classroom functioning.

809,The difficult lives of individuals with bipolar disorder: A review of functional outcomes and their implications for treatment,"Background Most longitudinal or treatment studies in bipolar disorder have used symptomatic or syndromal status as the primary outcome variable. More recently, psychosocial functioning has been highlighted as a key domain of outcome. Patients with bipolar disorder appear to be impaired in all functional domains, although the factors that cause impairment have not been clearly specified. Methods This paper reviews cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on functional impairment and its relationship to symptomatic, neurocognitive, personality, and stress variables in bipolar disorder; and the implications of these relationships for defining treatment targets. 93 articles were located through comprehensive MEDLINE, SCOPUS and Web of Science searches. Results and discussion Functional recovery following a mood episode consistently lags behind symptomatic and syndromal recovery. Longer term functional impairment is only partly explained by the number of manic/hypomanic episodes. Depression (including subsyndromal states) and persistent neurocognitive impairment are the strongest correlates of functional impairment in bipolar disorder, with personality and psychosocial stressors playing secondary roles. Possible treatment options include: more aggressive treatment of subthreshold depressive states, pharmacotherapies that target cognition (e.g., stimulants), and adjunctive psychotherapies including cognitive remediation.

810,Yoga for reducing perceived stress and back pain at work,"Background Stress and back pain are two key factors leading to sickness absence at work. Recent research indicates that yoga can be effective for reducing perceived stress, alleviating back pain, and improving psychological well-being.Aims To determine the effectiveness of a yoga-based intervention for reducing perceived stress and back pain at work.Methods Participants were recruited from a British local government authority and randomized into a yoga group who received one 50 min Dru Yoga session each week for 8 weeks and a 20 min DVD for home practice and a control group who received no intervention. Baseline and end-programme measurements of self-reported stress, back pain and psychological well-being were assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale.Results There were 37 participants in each group. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression showed that in comparison to the control group, the yoga group reported significant reductions in perceived stress and back pain, and a substantial improvement in psychological well-being. When compared with the control group at the end of the programme, the yoga group scores were significantly lower for perceived stress, back pain, sadness and hostility, and substantially higher for feeling self-assured, attentive and serene.Conclusions The results indicate that a workplace yoga intervention can reduce perceived stress and back pain and improve psychological well-being. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the broader efficacy of yoga for improving workplace productivity and reducing sickness absence.","Hartfiel, N.; Burton, C.; Rycroft-Malone, J.; Clarke, G.; Havenhand, J.; Khalsa, S.

811,The effectiveness of yoga for the improvement of well-being and resilience to stress in the workplace,"Objectives Recent research has indicated concern for the degree of stress and emotional well-being among university staff. This study examined the effectiveness of yoga in enhancing emotional well-being and resilience to stress among university employees.Methods In a randomized controlled trial at a British university, we recruited 48 employees and randomized them into either a yoga or a wait-list control group. The yoga group was offered six weeks of Dru Yoga, comprising one 60-minute class per week. These classes were offered by a certified Dru Yoga instructor at lunchtime from January March 2008. The wait-list control group received no intervention during this six-week study. Baseline and end-program measurements of self-reported mood and well-being were self-assessed with the Profile of Mood States Bipolar (POMS-Bi) and the Inventory of Positive Psychological Attitudes (IPPA).Results This six-week yoga intervention resulted in significantly improved POMS-Bi and IPPA scores for the yoga compared to the wait-list control group for seven of eight measures of mood and well-being. In comparison to the wait-list control group at baseline and the end of the program, the yoga group reported marked improvements in feelings of clear-mindedness, composure, elation, energy, and confidence. In addition, the yoga group reported increased life purpose and satisfaction, and feelings of greater self-confidence during stressful situations.Conclusion These results show that even a short program of yoga is effective for enhancing emotional wellbeing and resilience to stress in the workplace. We suggest that employers should consider offering yoga classes to their employees.","Hartfiel, Ned; Havenhand, Jon; Khalsa, Sat Bir; Clarke, Graham; Krayer, Anne",1,10.5271/sjweh.2916,614
813,A community-integrated home based depression intervention for older African Americans: descripton of the Beat the Blues randomized trial and intervention costs,"Background: Primary care is the principle setting for depression treatment; yet many older African Americans in the United States fail to report depressive symptoms or receive the recommended standard of care. Older African Americans are at high risk for depression due to elevated rates of chronic illness, disability and socioeconomic distress. There is an urgent need to develop and test new depression treatments that resonate with minority populations that are hard-to-reach and underserved and to evaluate their cost and cost-effectiveness.Methods/Design: Beat the Blues (BTB) is a single-blind parallel randomized trial to assess efficacy of a non-pharmacological intervention to reduce depressive symptoms and improve quality of life in 208 African Americans 55+ years old. It involves a collaboration with a senior center whose care management staff screen for depressive symptoms (telephone or in-person) using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Individuals screened positive (PHQ-9 >= 5) on two separate occasions over 2 weeks are referred to local mental health resources and BTB. Interested and eligible participants who consent receive a baseline home interview and then are randomly assigned to receive BTB immediately or 4 months later (wait-list control). All participants are interviewed at 4 (main study endpoint) and 8 months at home by assessors masked to study assignment. Licensed senior center social workers trained in BTB meet with participants at home for up to 10 sessions over 4 months to assess care needs, make referrals/linkages, provide depression education, instruct in stress reduction techniques, and use behavioral activation to identify goals and steps to achieve them. Key outcomes include reduced depressive symptoms (primary), reduced anxiety and functional disability, improved quality of life, and enhanced depression knowledge and behavioral activation (secondary). Fidelity is enhanced through procedure manuals and staff training and monitored by face-to-face supervision and review of taped sessions. Cost and cost effectiveness is being evaluated.Discussion: BTB is designed to bridge gaps in mental health service access and treatments for older African Americans. Treatment components are tailored to specific care needs, depression knowledge, preference for stress reduction techniques, and personal activity goals. Total costs are $584.64/4 months; or $146.16 per participant/per month.

814,Factors Mediating the Effects of a Depression Intervention on Functional Disability in Older African Americans,"ObjectivesTo determine factors mediating the effects of a depression intervention for older African Americans on functional disability and, secondarily, whether functional improvements mediate intervention effects on depressive symptoms.DesignStructural equation modeling to examine mediators in a secondary analysis of a randomized trial with 4-month follow-up.SettingPhiladelphia region.ParticipantsCommunity-dwelling African Americans (55) with depressive symptoms living in an urban area (N=208).InterventionUp to 10 one-hour sessions over 4months conducted by licensed social workers who provided care management, referrals and linkages, stress reduction techniques, depression knowledge and symptom recognition, and behavioral activation techniques.MeasurementsMain outcome was self-reported functional difficulty level for 18 basic activities. Mediators included depression severity (Patient Health Questionnaire), depression knowledge and symptom recognition, behavioral activation, and anxiety.ResultsAt 4months, the intervention had positive effects on functional difficulty and all mediators (P<.001). Separate structural equation models indicated that two factors (reduced depressive symptoms (23.5% mediated) and improved depression knowledge and symptom recognition (52.9% mediated)) significantly mediated the intervention's effect on functional disability. Enhancing behavioral activation and decreasing anxiety were not found to mediate improvements in functional disability. The two significant mediators jointly explained 62.5% of the intervention's total effect on functional disability. Functional improvement was not found to mediate the intervention's effect on depressive symptoms.ConclusionThis multicomponent depression intervention for African Americans has an effect on functional disability that is driven primarily by enhancing symptom recognition and decreasing depressive symptoms. Reduction of functional difficulties did not account for improvements in depressive symptoms. Nonpharmacological treatments for depressive symptoms that enhance symptom recognition in older African Americans can also reduce their functional difficulties with daily living activities.","Gitlin, Laura N.; Szanton, Sarah L.; Huang, Jin; Roth, David L.",0,10.1111/jgs.13156,616
815,Tailored activities to manage neuropsychiatric behaviors in persons with dementia and reduce caregiver burden: A randomized pilot study,"Objective: To test whether the Tailored Activity Program (TAP) reduces dementia-related neuropsychiatric behaviors, promotes activity engagement, and enhances caregiver wellbeing. Design: Prospective, two-group (treatment, wait-list control), randomized, controlled pilot study with 4 months as main trial endpoint. At 4 months, controls received the TAP intervention and were reassessed 4 months later. Setting: Patients' homes. Participants: Sixty dementia patients and family caregivers. Intervention: The eight-session occupational therapy intervention involved neuropsychological and functional testing, selection, and customization of activities to match capabilities identified in testing, and instruction to caregivers in use of activities. Measurements: Behavioral occurrences, activity engagement, and quality of life in dementia patients; objective and subjective burden and skill enhancement in caregivers. Results: At 4 months, compared with controls, intervention caregivers reported reduced frequency of problem behaviors, and specifically for shadowing and repetitive questioning, and greater activity engagement including the ability to keep busy. Fewer intervention caregivers reported agitation or argumentation. Caregiver benefits included fewer hours doing things and being on duty, greater mastery, self-efficacy, and skill enhancement. Wait-list control participants following intervention showed similar benefits for reductions in behavioral frequency and caregiver hours doing things for the patient and mastery. Caregivers with depressed symptoms derived treatment benefits similar to nondepressed caregivers. Conclusions: Tailoring activities to the capabilities of dementia patients and training families in activity use resulted in clinically relevant benefits for patients and caregivers. Treatment minimized trigger behaviors for nursing home placement and reduced objective caregiver burden. Noteworthy is that depressed caregivers effectively engaged in and benefited from the intervention.","Gitlin, Laura N.; Winter, Laraine; Burke, Janice; Chernett, Nancy; Dennis, Marie P.; Hauck, Walter W.",0,10.1097/JGP.0b013e318160da72,617

The study targets 272 stressed racially diverse family caregivers providing in-home care to persons with moderate stage dementia with one or more behavioral disturbances. All participants are interviewed at baseline, 4-months (main trial endpoint), and 6-months (maintenance). The four-month intervention involves up to 13 visits from an occupational therapist who works with families to problem-solve potential triggers (communication style, environmental clutter) contributing to behaviors, and instruct in strategies to reduce caregiver stress and manage targeted behaviors. To rule out infection or other potential medical contributors to behaviors, a nurse obtains blood and urine samples from the dementia patient, and conducts a medication review. Participants in the no-treatment control group are offered the nurse arm and one in-home session following trial completion at 6-months. This paper describes the research methods, theoretical and clinical aspects of this multi-component, targeted psycho-social treatment approach, and the measures used to evaluate quality of life improvements for persons with dementia and their families.","Gitlin, Laura N.; Winter, Laraine; Dennis, Marie P.; Hauck, Walter W.",0,10.2147/CIA.S1337,618

Between 16 and 24 weeks, three telephone contacts reinforced strategy use.MEASUREMENTSPrimary outcomes were frequency of targeted problem behavior and caregiver upset with and confidence managing it at 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes were caregiver well-being and management skills at 16 and 24 weeks and caregiver perceived benefits. Prevalence of medical conditions for intervention patients were also examined.RESULTSAt 16 weeks, 67.5% of intervention caregivers reported improvement in targeted problem behavior, compared with 45.8% of caregivers in a no-treatment control group (P=.002), and reduced upset with (P=.03) and enhanced confidence managing (P=.01) the behavior. Additionally, intervention caregivers reported less upset with all problem behaviors (P=.001), less negative communication (P=.02), less burden (P=.05), and better well-being (P=.001) than controls. Fewer intervention caregivers had depressive symptoms (53.0%) than control group caregivers (67.8%, P=.02). Similar caregiver outcomes occurred at 24 weeks. Intervention caregivers perceived more study benefits (P <.05), including ability to keep family members home, than controls.

They also determined if treatment effect varied by caregiver gender, race, and relationship to patient. Design and Methods: Families (N = 171) of dementia patients were randomized to intervention or usual care control group. The intervention involved 5 90-min home visits by occupational therapists who provided education and physical and social environmental modifications. Results: Compared with controls, intervention caregivers reported fewer declines in patients' instrumental activities of daily living (p = .030) and less decline in self-care and fewer behavior problems in patients at 3 months post-test. Also, intervention spouses reported reduced upset (p = .049), women reported enhanced self-efficacy in managing behaviors (p = .038), and women (p = .049) and minorities (p = .037) reported enhanced self-efficacy in managing functional dependency. Implications: The environmental program appears to have a modest effect on dementia patients' IADL dependence. Also, among certain subgroups of caregivers the program improves self-efficacy and reduces upset in specific areas of caregiving.","Gitlin, LN; Corcoran, M; Winter, L; Boyce, A; Hauck, WW",0,10.1093/geront/41.1.4,620
819,Effects of the home Environmental Skill-Building Program on the caregiver-care recipient dyad: 6-month outcomes from the Philadelphia REACH initiative,"Purpose: We examine 6-month effects of the Environmental Skill-Building Program on caregiver wellbeing and care recipient functioning and whether effects vary by caregiver gender, race (White or non-White), and relationship (spouse or nonspouse). Design and Methods: We enrolled 255 family caregivers of community-residing persons with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders, of whom 190 participated in a follow-up interview. Caregivers were randomized to a usual care control group or intervention group that received five home contacts and one telephone contact by occupational therapists, who provided education, problem-solving training, and adaptive equipment. Baseline and 6-month follow-up included self-report measures of caregiver objective and subjective burden, caregiver well-being, and care recipient problem behaviors and physical function. Results: Compared with controls (n = 101), intervention caregivers (n = 89) reported less upset with memory-related behaviors, less need for assistance from others, and better affect. Intervention spouses reported less upset with disruptive behaviors; men reported spending less time in daily oversight; and women reported less need for help from others, better affect, and enhanced management ability, overall well-being, and mastery relative to control group counterparts. Statistically significant treatment differences were not found for hours helping with instrumental activities of daily living, upset with providing assistance with instrumental activities of daily living and activities of daily living, perceived change in somatic symptoms, White versus non-White caregivers, or care recipient outcomes. Implications: The Environmental Skill-Building Program reduces burden and enhances caregiver wellbeing in select domains and has added benefit for women and spouses.","Gitlin, LN; Winter, L; Corcoran, M; Dennis, MP; Schinfeld, S; Hauck, WW",0,10.1093/geront/43.4.532,621
820,Reducing Work and Family Conflict in Teachers: A Randomised Controlled Trial of Workplace Triple P,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a workplace parenting intervention aimed at reducing work-family conflict and improving work and family functioning in teachers. One hundred and seven teachers (who were also parents) were randomly allocated to either a Workplace Triple P intervention condition or a waitlist control condition. Analyses indicated the intervention had a positive effect on a range of occupational variables including work-to-family conflict, family-to-work conflict, occupational stress and teaching efficacy. Intervention effects were also found for family- and personal adjustment-related variables including dysfunctional parenting styles, child behaviour, parenting efficacy, and depression and anxiety. Small to large effect sizes were obtained (Cohen's d=.34-.85), and all intervention effects were maintained at 4-month follow-up. The results indicate that a parenting intervention can reduce work-family conflict and occupational stress and improve family functioning in teachers balancing work and family. The implications for supporting teachers with family interventions delivered in the workplace are discussed.

821,"Psychophysiological effects of a web-based stress management system: A prospective, randomized controlled intervention study of IT and media workers [ISRCTN54254861]","Background: The aim of the present study was to assess possible effects on mental and physical well-being and stress-related biological markers of a web-based health promotion tool. Methods: A randomized, prospectively controlled study was conducted with before and after measurements, involving 303 employees (187 men and 116 women, age 23-64) from four information technology and two media companies. Half of the participants were offered web-based health promotion and stress management training (intervention) lasting for six months. All other participants constituted the reference group. Different biological markers were measured to detect possible physiological changes. Results: After six months the intervention group had improved statistically significantly compared to the reference group on ratings of ability to manage stress, sleep quality, mental energy, concentration ability and social support. The anabolic hormone dehydroepiandosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) decreased significantly in the reference group as compared to unchanged levels in the intervention group. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) increased significantly in the intervention group compared to the reference group. Chromogranin A (CgA) decreased significantly in the intervention group as compared to the reference group. Tumour necrosis factor Î± (TNFÎ±) decreased significantly in the reference group compared to the intervention group. Logistic regression analysis revealed that group (intervention vs. reference) remained a significant factor in five out of nine predictive models. Conclusion: The results indicate that an automatic web-based system might have short-term beneficial physiological and psychological effects and thus might be an opportunity in counteracting some clinically relevant and common stress and health issues of today.

822,"Women Using a Web-based Digital Health Coaching Programme for Stress Management: Stress Sources, Symptoms and Coping Strategies","Researchers have proposed and tested many theories to understand gender differences in stress experiences. However, little research has identified differences between subgroups of women in terms of stress sources, symptoms, coping strategies and help-seeking behaviour. The purpose of this study was to examine these characteristics of women seeking help for stress management through a digital health coaching programme. We examined cross-sectional data from 63,690 women between the ages of 18 and 59 years who participated in the stress management programme from 2001 to 2008. We divided the sample into age groups to identify developmental patterns in their stress characteristics. Work, time demands and psychological reactions to stress were consistent concerns, whereas between-group comparisons indicated diverse stress characteristics by age group. Importantly, women at all ages reported being uncomfortable asking for help. The findings suggest that technology-based solutions like digital health coaching may reach women who may not otherwise seek or receive help for stress management. The results also emphasize the importance of considering the unique characteristics of women when providing them stress management interventions.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term effects of a low-intensity work-site heart disease risk reduction program using a matched pair design with work site as the unit of analysis. Methods. Twenty-six heterogeneous work sites with between 125 and 750 employees were matched on key organization characteristics and then randomly assigned to early or delayed intervention conditions. Early intervention consisted of an 18-month multifaceted program that featured an employee steering committee and a menu approach to conducting key intervention activities tailored to each site. Results. Cross-sectional and cohort analyses produced consistent results. At the conclusion of the intervention, early and delayed intervention conditions did not differ on changes in stocking rates, dietary intake, or cholesterol levels. There was considerable variability in outcomes among work sites within each condition. Conclusions. Despite documented implementation of key intervention activities and organization-level changes in terms of perceived support for health promotion, this intervention did not produce short-term improvements beyond secular trends observed in control work sites. Research is needed to understand determinants of variability between work sites.","Glasgow R.E., Terborg J.R., Hollis J.F., Severson H.H., Boles S.M.",0,10.2105/AJPH.85.2.209,625

827,Assessing the Organizational Social Context (OSC) of child welfare systems: Implications for research and practice,"Objective: The study: (1) provides the first assessment of the a priori measurement model and psychometric properties of the Organizational Social Context (OSC) measurement system in a US nationwide probability sample of child welfare systems; (2) illustrates the use of the OSC in constructing norm-based organizational culture and climate profiles for child welfare systems; and (3) estimates the association of child welfare system-level organizational culture and climate profiles with individual caseworker-level job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Methods: The study applies confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and hierarchical linear models (HLM) analysis to a US nationwide sample of 1,740 caseworkers from 81 child welfare systems participating in the second National Survey of Child and Adolescent Wellbeing (NSCAW II). The participating child welfare systems were selected using a national probability procedure reflecting the number of children served by child welfare systems nationwide. Results: The a priori OSC measurement model is confirmed in this nationwide sample of child welfare systems. In addition, caseworker responses to the OSC scales generate acceptable to high scale reliabilities, moderate to high within-system agreement, and significant between-system differences. Caseworkers in the child welfare systems with the best organizational culture and climate profiles report higher levels of job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Organizational climates characterized by high engagement and functionality, and organizational cultures characterized by low rigidity are associated with the most positive work attitudes. Conclusions: The OSC is the first valid and reliable measure of organizational culture and climate with US national norms for child welfare systems. The OSC provides a useful measure of Organizational Social Context for child welfare service improvement and implementation research efforts which include a focus on child welfare system culture and climate.

828,Lifecourse social conditions and racial and ethnic patterns of cognitive aging,"A lifecourse perspective is key for understanding and interpreting racial and ethnic patterns in neuropsychological test performance. In this article, we discuss contextual factors that shape the environmental conditions encountered by racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, in particular African-Americans. These conditions include geographic segregation at the level of regions, metropolitan areas, and neighborhoods; intra- and inter-national migration patterns; socioeconomic position, including financial resources, and occupational and educational opportunities; discrimination; and group resources. Each of these exposures sets in course a cascade of individual mediators that ultimately manifest in neuropsychological outcomes. The physiological and behavioral consequences of these pathways likely accumulate across the lifecourse. We focus on cognitive aging, although the processes discussed here begin in infancy and likely influence cognitive outcomes throughout life from childhood into old age. A lifecourse framework can help inform clinical encounters, neuropsychological research, and surveillance regarding the population prevalence of cognitive impairments.

830,The effect of heart rate variability biofeedback training on stress and anxiety: A meta-analysis,"Background Some evidence suggests that heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback might be an effective way to treat anxiety and stress symptoms. To examine the effect of HRV biofeedback on symptoms of anxiety and stress, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies extracted from PubMed, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library. Methods The search identified 24 studies totaling 484 participants who received HRV biofeedback training for stress and anxiety. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis. Results The pre-post within-group effect size (Hedges' g) was 0.81. The between-groups analysis comparing biofeedback to a control condition yielded Hedges' g = 0.83. Moderator analyses revealed that treatment efficacy was not moderated by study year, risk of study bias, percentage of females, number of sessions, or presence of an anxiety disorder. Conclusions HRV biofeedback training is associated with a large reduction in self-reported stress and anxiety. Although more well-controlled studies are needed, this intervention offers a promising approach for treating stress and anxiety with wearable devices.

831,The long-term impact of Johnson & Johnson's health & Wellness Program on employee health risks,"To be viewed as successful, corporate health promotion and disease prevention programs must demonstrate that they can improve the risk profile of employees as a whole, and, in particular, those employees at highest risk. This study reports the effectiveness of Johnson & Johnson's newly configured Health & Wellness Program in reducing the health risks of 4586 employees who participated in two serial health screening programs, with a minimum of 1 year between screenings. The study also examines the impact of participation. in a high-risk intervention program called Pathways to Change(R) on health risk factors. McNemar chi-squared and z-test statistics were used to evaluate changes in health risks overtime. Results indicate significant risk reduction in 8 of 13 risk categories examined for all employees who participated in two health risk assessments over an average of 2 14 years. When comparing pathways to Change participants with non-participants, participants outperformed their non-participant counterparts in six categories but performed worse in five other categories that were not specifically targeted by the high-risk program. In two categories, no differences were found.

832,Benefits of a contextual approach to understanding and treating complex trauma,"The conceptual framework and treatment rationale of contextual therapy are described. Contextual therapy was specifically fashioned for survivors of prolonged child abuse (PCA). It is grounded in the observation that contexts beyond abuse trauma, especially restrictions in psychological development stemming from growing up in an ineffective family environment, appreciably impact the adjustment of many PCA survivors. Contextual therapy proposes that remediation of developmental gaps commonly manifested by PCA survivors is essential to equip them to (a) benefit from rather than be debilitated by trauma processing and (b) move beyond symptom reduction to the attainment of adequate social and occupational functioning.

834,Web-Based and Mobile Stress Management Intervention for Employees: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Work-related stress is highly prevalent among employees and is associated with adverse mental health consequences. Web-based interventions offer the opportunity to deliver effective solutions on a large scale; however, the evidence is limited and the results conflicting.OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of guided Web- and mobile-based stress management training for employees.METHODS: A total of 264 employees with elevated symptoms of stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10, PSS-10â‰¥22) were recruited from the general working population and randomly assigned to an Internet-based stress management intervention (iSMI) or waitlist control group. The intervention (GET.ON Stress) was based on Lazarus's transactional model of stress, consisted of seven sessions, and applied both well-established problem solving and more recently developed emotion regulation strategies. Participants also had the opportunity to request automatic text messages on their mobile phone along with the iSMI. Participants received written feedback on every completed session from an e-coach. The primary outcome was perceived stress (PSS-10). Web-based self-report assessments for both groups were scheduled at baseline, 7 weeks, and 6 months. At 12 months, an extended follow-up was carried out for the iSMI group only.RESULTS: An intention-to-treat analysis of covariance revealed significantly large effect differences between iSMI and waitlist control groups for perceived stress at posttest (F1,261=58.08, P<.001; Cohen's d=0.83) and at the 6-month follow-up (F1,261=80.17, P<.001; Cohen's d=1.02). The effects in the iSMI group were maintained at 12-month follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: This Web- and mobile-based intervention has proven effective in reducing stress in employees in the long term.

Given the potential of school environments to affect student well-being, the Louisiana Tobacco Control Program developed and tested a pilot program, Schools Putting Prevention to Work. The objective was to assist school districts in developing a comprehensive school wellness policy and engaging their school community to generate environments that support healthful choices and behaviors. Community Context The pilot was implemented in 27 school districts, reaching an estimated 325,000 people across the state. Demographics of participating students were similar to all Louisiana's public school students. Methods A school wellness project state team advised project development. A subgroup that included contractors and partners implemented and modified the pilot. Sites were selected though an application process. Site representatives received trainings, technical assistance, and funding to organize school-based support-building activities and coordinate a school health advisory council to develop policy and sustain healthy school environments. Project sites reported progress monthly; evaluation included data from sites and project administrators. Outcome Twenty-five comprehensive school wellness policies (covering mo% tobacco-free schools and daily physical activity and healthier cafeteria items) were approved by school boards. Environmental changes such as physical activity breaks, healthier vending options, and tobacco-free campuses were adopted. Interpretation This pilot demonstrated a successful approach to achieving policy and environmental change. The state team engaged and guided school districts to motivate students, parents, faculty/staff/administration, and businesses to establish and maintain opportunities to improve lifestyle health.","Gollub, EA; Kennedy, BM; Bourgeois, BF; Broyles, ST; Katzmarzyk, PT",0,10.5888/pcd11.130149,633
837,Three City Feasibility Study of a Body Empowerment and HIV Prevention Intervention Among Women with Drug Use Histories: Women FIT,"Background: New intervention models are needed for HIV prevention among drug-using women.Methods: The Women Fighting Infection Together (Women FIT) feasibility study enrolled 189 women in three U. S. cities (Providence, New York, Philadelphia) with drug-using histories, who also reported risky sexual behavior. Eligible women had participated previously in a yearlong study of HIV Counseling and Testing (HIV-CT) and limited case management. Two thirds of the sample were black, most were unemployed, and about two thirds reported prior or current crack use. Women were randomized into two groups. In one group, women participated in a manualized, four-session, peer-led, interactive group intervention that stressed body knowledge, woman-initiated HIV/sexually transmitted infection (HIV/STI) prevention, including a focus on women's health (reproductive health screening, sexual violence, self-breast examination, STI signs, symptoms), which aimed to increase comfort with and pride in their bodies. Control group women received HIV-CT enriched by female condom counseling. Outcomes included study retention, session attendance and ratings, changes in knowledge, and use of protection methods.Results: The study successfully retained 95% of the participants for a 2-month follow-up. Positive assessments from participants and peer leaders exceeded preset thresholds for success. Pre-post changes in body knowledge (p < 0.0001) and protection methods knowledge (p < 0.01) was greater among the intervention women than the control women.Conclusions: The body empowerment model deserves further elaboration in interventions focusing on women at high risk of HIV/STI acquisition.","Gollub, Erica L.; Morrow, Kathleen M.; Mayer, Kenneth H.; Koblin, Beryl A.; Peterside, Pamela Brown; Husnik, Marla J.; Metzger, David S.",0,10.1089/jwh.2009.1778,634

Method: In all, 196 male prisoners from Aberdeen prison completed the Symptom Checklistâ€“90, which examines various clinical symptoms and emotional distress. Current adult symptoms were assessed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) criteria for ADHD. Results: Emotional distress and ADHD explained the variance in prison records of behavioral disturbance above and beyond antisocial personality (ASP) traits; however, much of the effect of emotional distress was mediated by ADHD symptoms. Only ADHD symptoms were significantly associated to history of violent offending, whereas ASP and age mostly explained nonviolent offenses and overall recidivism. Conclusion: Our results provide support for the conceptual association between ADHD and its related emotional dimension with behavioral disturbance in prison, suggesting a link to reactive violence.

839,Latinos and HIV/AIDS: Examining factors related to disparity and identifying opportunities for psychosocial intervention research,"Latinos maintain an AIDS case rate more than 3 times higher than whites, a greater rate of progression to AIDS, and a higher rate of HIV/AIDS-related deaths. Three broad areas are reviewed related to these disparities: (1) relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and socio-cultural factors among Latinos; (2) drug abuse and mental health problems in Latinos relevant to HIV/AIDS outcomes; and (3) opportunities for psychosocial intervention. Latinos living with HIV are a rapidly growing group, are more severely impacted by HIV than whites, and confront unique challenges in coping with HIV/AIDS. A body of research suggests that depression, substance abuse, treatment adherence, health literacy, and access to healthcare may be fruitful targets for intervention research in this population. Though limited, the current literature suggests that psychosocial interventions that target these factors could help reduce HIV/AIDS disparities between Latinos and whites and could have important public health value.

841,Childhood exposure to emotional abuse and later life stress among Kenyan women: a mediation analysis of cross-sectional data,"Background and objective: We explore whether perceived stress among Kenyan mothers is predicted by childhood exposure to emotional abuseâ€“both witnessed among parents and experienced directly. Further, we explore whether this association is mediated by social support, family functioning and polygynous marriage. Design: We used cross-sectional data from a systematic random sample (n = 1974) of mothers in semi-rural Kenya. Methods: Data were collected using validated scales and trained interviewers. Analyses were conducted using bootstrapped structural equation models and fixed-effects linear regression models, controlling for age and household wealth. Results: Reported experience of emotional abuseâ€“both directly experienced and observed among household adultsâ€“was high in the present population (72.5% and 69%, respectively). Perceived stress among women was significantly higher if they were exposed to more emotional abuse during childhood (p <.001). Lower social support, worse family functioning and higher rates of polygynous marriage mediated pathways between emotional abuse exposure during childhood and adult perceived stress. Conclusion: Future research should investigate whether social integration, identity formation and self-esteem underlie observed dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa. Efforts to promote social integration and support should target children currently experiencing emotional abuse, and may include child-targeted high quality television programing and adult-targeted media and celebrity campaigns.

845,The Age-Related Eye Disease 2 Study: Micronutrients in the Treatment of Macular Degeneration,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of vision loss in the elderly. With an increasingly aged population worldwide, the need for the prevention of AMD is rising. Multiple studies investigating AMD with the use of animal models and cell culture have identified oxidative stress-related retinal damage as an important contributing factor. In general, diet is an excellent source of the antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals necessary for healthy living; moreover, the general public is often receptive to recommendations made by physicians and health care workers regarding diet and supplements as a means of empowering themselves to avoid common and worrisome ailments such as AMD, which has made epidemiologists and clinicians enthusiastic about dietary intervention studies. A wide variety of nutrients, such as minerals, vitamins, v-3 (n-3) fatty acids, and various carotenoids, have been associated with reducing the risk of AMD. Initial results from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) indicated that supplementation with antioxidants (beta-carotene and vitamins C and E) and zinc was associated with a reduced risk of AMD progression. The AREDS2 follow-up study, designed to improve upon the earlier formulation, tested the addition of lutein, zeaxanthin, and v-3 fatty acids.

These studies are reviewed and their limitations are discussed with regard to definitions (including the concepts of stress and anxiety), stress measurements, samples, and control for confounds such as depression. It appears necessary to assess individual stress reactivity prospectively and separately at each trimester of pregnancy, to discriminate chronic from acute stress, and to take into consideration moderator variables such as past life events, sociocultural factors, predictability, social support and coping strategies. Furthermore, it might be useful to examine simultaneously, during but also after pregnancy, stress, anxiety and depression in order to understand better their relationships and to evaluate their specific effects on pregnancy and child development. Finally, further research could benefit from an integrated psychological and biological approach studying together subjective perceived stress and objective physiological stress responses in pregnant women, and their effects on fetal and child development as well as on mother-infant interactions.

850,Reducing nurses' stress: A randomized controlled trial of a web-based stress management program for nurses,"Background: Nursing is a notoriously high-stress occupation - emotionally taxing and physically draining, with a high incidence of burnout. In addition to the damaging effects of stress on nurses' health and well being, stress is also a major contributor to attrition and widespread shortages in the nursing profession. Although there exist promising in-person interventions for addressing the problem of stress among nurses, the experience of our group across multiple projects in hospitals has indicated that the schedules and workloads of nurses can pose problems for implementing in-person interventions, and that web-based interventions might be ideally suited to addressing the high levels of stress among nurses. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the web-based BREATHE: Stress Management for Nurses program. Methods: The randomized controlled trial was conducted with 104 nurses in five hospitals in Virginia and one hospital in New York. The primary outcome measure was perceived nursing-related stress. Secondary measures included symptoms of distress, coping, work limitations, job satisfaction, use of substances to relieve stress, alcohol consumption, and understanding depression and anxiety. Results: Program group participants experienced significantly greater reductions than the control group on the full Nursing Stress Scale, and six of the seven subscales. No other significant results were found. Moderator analysis found that nurses with greater experience benefitted more. Conclusion: Using a web-based program holds tremendous promise for providing nurses with the tools they need to address nursing related stress.

Reducing levels of stress could support overall functioning and mental condition in those at risk.Methods: The Jorvi Early Psychosis Recognition and Intervention (JERI) project at Helsinki University Central Hospital, Jorvi Hospital, Finland, is an early intervention team for adolescents at risk of developing first-episode psychosis. The project is based on the idea of multiprofessional, community, home, family and network-oriented, stress-reducing, overall functioning-supporting, low-threshold care. The JERI team meets multiprofessionally with adolescents in their natural surroundings, for example, at school or at home, together with their parents, network and community co-worker, who has originally contacted the JERI team because of unclear mental health problems. Subjects were assessed with the PROD-prodromal screen to identify those at risk of developing first-episode psychosis.Results: Statistically significant difference between baseline and follow-up measures was found in at risk subjects (n=28) in scales of overall functioning (P=0.000), depression (P=0.001), anxiety (P=0.001), quality of life (QOL) and pre-psychotic symptoms.Conclusions: JERI-type intervention may improve level of overall functioning and support mental condition in adolescents at risk of developing first- episode psychosis, even though further study with larger numbers of subjects, with a control group and with a longer follow-up time, is needed.","Grano, Niklas; Karjalainen, Marjaana; Anto, Jukka; Itkonen, Arja; Edlund, Virve; Roine, Mikko",0,10.1111/j.1751-7893.2009.00114.x,645
853,A cluster randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of Trauma Risk Management (TRiM) in a military population,"Trauma Risk Management is a peer-support program that aims to promote help-seeking in the aftermath of traumatic events. Prior to its implementation, the British military conducted a randomized controlled trial of Trauma Risk Management against standard care in 12 warships; 6 were randomized to use Trauma Risk Management after collecting baseline measurements. Follow up after 12-18 months found no significant change in psychological health or stigma scores in either group; however, the studied vessels only encountered low numbers of critical incidents. Additionally, measurements of organizational functioning were modestly better in the Trauma Risk Management ships. The authors conclude that within organizations using Trauma Risk Management may be beneficial and may, in time, lead to a valuable cultural shift.

856,Symptoms of post-traumatic stress: Intrusion and avoidance 6 and 12 months after TBI,"Primary objectives: (1) To examine survivors with traumatic brain injury (TBI) for symptoms of avoidance and intrusion, two dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS) at 6 and 12 months post-injury. (2) To identify risk factors associated with these symptoms. Research design: Prospective follow-up study. Methods and procedures: Georgia and North Carolina Model Brain Injury Systems participants (n=198) with mild (19%), moderate (21%) and severe (60%) TBI were interviewed by telephone at 6 and 12 months post-injury. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to identify intrusion and avoidance symptoms. Results: Symptoms consistent with severe PTS increased from 11% at 6 months to 16% 12 months post-injury (p<0.003). African-Americans (p<0.01) and women (p<0.05) reported greater symptomatology at 12 months compared to their counterparts. TBI severity and memory of the event were not associated with PTS-like symptoms. Symptoms increased over time when examined by race, injury intent, gender and age (p<0.05). Conclusions: Regardless of severity, survivors with TBI are at risk for developing symptoms consistent with PTS. Amnesia for the injury event was not protective against developing these symptoms. African-Americans appear to be at greatest risk. Â© 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Greenspan A.I., Stringer A.Y., Phillips V.L., Hammond F.M., Goldstein F.C.",0,10.1080/02699050600773276,647
858,Assessment of anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders,"Anxiety disorders are among the most common comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), although assessment presents unique challenges. Many symptoms of anxiety appear to overlap with common presentations of autism. Furthermore, deficits in language and cognitive functioning make it difficult for such children to convey their emotional states accurately. A comprehensive review of the recent literature was conducted to assay the types and rates of use of tools for evaluating anxiety symptoms in children and adolescents with ASDs. We identified strengths and weaknesses in existing scales, identified instruments that (although imperfect) seem to have a good coverage for youngsters with ASDs, recommended strategies for studying anxiety in these youth, and offered suggestions for future scale development.

859,Application of a flow stress function in programmes for computer simulation of plastic working processes,"Computer simulation of plastic working processes enables, unavailable so far, getting closer of process model to real conditions. One of elements of computer simulation programme, that decide on accuracy of obtained analysis results, is a flow stress function which should take into account the effect of deformation history as well as current conditions of deformation of a particle surroundings corresponding with finite elements of the analysed area (Fig. 1). Obtaining of correct description of a flow stress function is related both to the mathematical structure of this function as well as to the methodology of experimental determination of flow stresses values. A mathematical form of the function should take into account the physical phenomena occurring in the material that decide about instantaneous value of the flow stress. These phenomena depend on the material and forming conditions as well as on the of history material's technological processes preceding the moment of starting the simulation of plastic working. Experimental determination of flow stress value for defined deformation conditions requires taking into account the phenomena occurring in a studied sample, that cause deviations from the assumed ideal conditions. They depend both on the test type (tension, compression, torsion) and on technical solutions for the test stand. Solutions related to the methodology of flow stress determination will be discussed in further part of the report on the basis of a plastometric torsion test. The types of flow stress functions and problems related to experimental determination of now stress will be discussed. Moreover, plastic working processes will be classified from the point of view of the choice of the most appropriate description of the flow stress for computer simulation requirements.","Grosman, F",0,10.1016/S0924-0136(96)02565-4,649
860,Abbreviated Resonant Frequency Training to Augment Heart Rate Variability and Enhance On-Demand Emotional Regulation in Elite Sport Support Staff,"Support and management staff in elite sport experience work-related stress and emotional disturbance to a similar extent as athletes (Fletcher and Wagstaff 2009). The resonant frequency breathing technique (Lehrer et al. 2000) can inhibit autonomic changes associated with stressful situations or events and as such provides a potential emotional regulation tool. The present study utilised five practitioner-led heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback sessions and home practice via mobile applications to train support and management staff (nÂ =Â 9) in resonant frequency breathing techniques. Although baseline HRV did not change from pre to post training, participants increased total HRV (i.e., SDNN; pÂ =Â .006), parasympathetic HRV (i.e., RMSSD; pÂ =Â .028) and HRV reflective of baroreflex function (i.e., low frequency power; pÂ =Â .018) while accurately performing resonant frequency breathing without a breath pacer. Post-intervention questionnaire data revealed an increase (pÂ =Â .032) in habitual use of somatic strategies for emotional regulation, and social validation data suggested that the technique enhanced emotional regulation at home, work and during international competition. HRV biofeedback and the resonant frequency technique provided an on-demand emotional regulation technique for elite sport support and management staff.

861,"Web-based stress management for newly diagnosed cancer patients (STREAM-1): A randomized, wait-list controlled intervention study","Background: Being diagnosed with cancer causes major psychological distress, yet the majority of newly diagnosed cancer patients lack psychological support. Internet interventions overcome many barriers for seeking face-to-face support and allow for independence in time and place. We assess efficacy and feasibility of the first web-based stress management intervention (STREAM: STREss-Aktiv-Mindern) for newly diagnosed, German-speaking cancer patients. Methods/design: In a prospective, wait-list controlled trial 120 newly diagnosed cancer patients will be included within 12 weeks of starting anti-cancer treatment and randomized between an immediate (intervention group) or delayed (control group) 8-week, web-based intervention. The intervention consists of eight modules with weekly written feedback by a psychologist (""minimal-contact"") based on well-established stress management manuals including downloadable audio-files and exercises. The aim of this study is to evaluate efficacy in terms of improvement in quality of life (FACT-F), as well as decrease in anxiety and depression (HADS), as compared to patients in the wait-list control group. A sample size of 120 patients allows demonstrating a clinically relevant difference of nine points in the FACT score after the intervention (T2) with a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and 80 % power. As this is the first online stress management intervention for German-speaking cancer patients, more descriptive outcomes are equally important to further refine the group of patients with the largest potential for benefit who then will be targeted more specifically in future trials. These descriptive endpoints include: patients' characteristics (type of cancer, type of treatment, socio-demographic factors), dropout rate and dropout reasons, adherence and satisfaction with the program. Discussion: New technologies open new opportunities: minimal-contact psychological interventions are becoming standard of care in several psychological disorders, where their efficacy is often comparable to face-to-face interventions. With our study we open this field to the population of newly diagnosed cancer patients. We will not only assess clinical efficacy but also further refine the target population who has the most potential to benefit. An internet-based minimal-contact stress management program might be an attractive, time- and cost-effective way to effectively deliver psychological support to newly diagnosed cancer patients and an opportunity to include those who currently are not reached by conventional support.

862,When Prolonged Exposure Fails: Adding an Imagery-Based Cognitive Restructuring Component in the Treatment of Industrial Accident Victims Suffering from PTSD,"Prolonged exposure (PE) is a widely promulgated treatment modality for PTSD. While successful with many subjects, PE also has a significant failure rate (i.e., dropouts, nonimprovement, symptom exacerbation). To date, outcome research has not examined why PE at times appears to be the treatment of choice for PTSD and why it sometimes needs to be combined with cognitive restructuring interventions to be effective. This study presents a detailed cognitive-behavioral analysis of two industrial victims suffering from PTSD who failed to benefit from PE alone, but who subsequently made a quick and lasting recovery when an imagery-based, cognitive restructuring component was added to their exposure treatment. A comparative analysis is presented of the theoretical underpinnings and treatment components of the behavioral and cognitive treatments used with the subjects in this study-PE and imagery rescripting and reprocessing therapy (IRRT). PE is a behavioral treatment based upon theories of classical conditioning that relies on exposure, habituation, desensitization, and extinction to facilitate emotional processing of fear. By contrast, IRRT is cognitive therapy applied in the context of imagery modification. In IRRT, exposure is employed not for habituation, but for activating the trauma memory so that the distressing cognitions (i.e., the trauma-related images and beliefs) can be identified, challenged, modified, and processed.","Grunert B.K., Smucker M.R., Weis J.M., Rusch M.D.",0,10.1016/S1077-7229(03)80051-2,652
864,Prevalence and psychometric screening for the detection of major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder in adults injured in a motor vehicle crash who are engaged in compensation,"Background: Physical injury and psychological disorder following a motor vehicle crash (MVC) is a public health concern. The objective of this research was to determine rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults with MVC-related injury engaged in compensation, and to determine the capacity (e.g. sensitivity and specificity) of two psychometric scales for estimating the presence of MDD and PTSD. Methods: Participants included 109 adults with MVC-related injury engaged in compensation during 2015 to 2017, in Sydney, Australia. The mean time from MVC to baseline assessment was 11 weeks. Comprehensive assessment was conducted at baseline, and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) were administered to determine probable MDD and PTSD. An online psychiatric interview, based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-5), was used to diagnose actual MDD and PTSD, acknowledged as gold standard diagnostic criteria. One-way multivariate analyses of variance established criterion validity of the DASS-21 and IES-R, and sensitivity and specificity analyses were conducted to determine the most sensitive cut-off points for detecting probable MDD and PTSD. Results: Substantial rates of MDD (53.2%) and PTSD (19.3%) were found. The DASS-21 and IES-R were shown to have excellent criterion validity for detecting MDD and PTSD in injured participants. A range of cut-off points were investigated and shown to have acceptable sensitivity and specificity for detecting MDD and PTSD in an injured population engaged in compensation. The preferred cut-off points based on this study are: to detect MDD, a DASS-21 total score of 30 and/or a DASS-21 depression score of 10; to detect PTSD, IES-R scores of 33-40 and/or a DASS-21 anxiety score of 7-8. Conclusions: Major psychological disorder is prevalent following a MVC. Results suggest the DASS-21 and IES-R are suitable for use in clinical/compensation settings to detect probable MDD and PTSD soon after a MVC in physically injured people engaged in compensation. These results provide positive direction in the public health arena for improving mental health outcomes.

This study examined the effect of a fermented dairy product containing the probiotic Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 (verum) on the incidence of respiratory and gastrointestinal common infectious diseases (CIDs) and on immune functions in healthy shift workers.Methods: The study was single-center, randomized, double-blind, and controlled. Volunteers received 200 g/day of verum (n = 500) or control product (n = 500) for 3 months; 1-month follow-up was carried out..Results: The cumulated number of CIDs (primary outcome) was not significantly different between groups. Because the Poisson distribution of the primary parameter did not fully lit the observed data, a post hoc categorical analysis was applied and showed a significantly lower cumulated number of CIDs in the verum group during the product consumption phase (odds ratio [OR] = 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.95, p = 0.017). Verum also reduced the proportion of volunteers experiencing at least I CID (43% vs. 51%, p = 0.005), increased the time to the first occurrence of CID (p = 0.017) in the whole population, and reduced the cumulated number of CIDs in the subgroup of smokers (p = 0.033). In the course of CID, cumulated duration of fever was lower in the verum group (in the whole study phase) (p = 0.022), and an increase in leukocyte, neutrophil, and natural killer (NK) cell counts and activity (p = 0.047 to p < 0.001) was observed compared with control group. Verum was safe and well tolerated.Conclusion: The results indicate that daily consumption of a fermented dairy product containing Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 could reduce the risk of common infections in stressed individuals such as shift workers.","Guillemard, Eric; Tanguy, Jerome; Flavigny, Ann'Laure; de la Motte, Stephan; Schrezenmeir, Juergen",0,10.1080/07315724.2010.10719882,654
867,Cliniciansâ€™ perceptions of delivering new models of high intensity aphasia treatment,"Background: While evidence suggests that intensive aphasia therapy is associated with positive patient outcomes, speech language pathologists continue to report delivering therapy at low intensity schedules. Investigation of the barriers and enablers of delivering intensive therapy in hospital settings is needed to help address this evidenceâ€“practice gap. Aims: To explore cliniciansâ€™ perceptions of delivering high intensity aphasia treatment through three different service models and their recommendations for future directions in implementing high intensity aphasia clinics in a public health setting. Methods & Procedures: A sequential mixed methods design was employed. Thirteen speech language pathologists who provided intensive aphasia therapy to 31 patients across three facilities as part of a larger study consented to participate. Participants contributed to a log of barriers and facilitators while delivering treatment and completed a questionnaire in the last week of treatment. Findings were used to inform the question guide for a focus group interview conducted with nine of the clinicians post-treatment. Outcomes & Results: Most clinicians found the increased intensity of treatment more difficult to deliver than standard treatment, and reported barriers included patient fatigue, patient personal factors, locating resources, scheduling and coordination issues, and clinician workload and potential burn-out. Emotional challenges were less expected and were potentially intensified by the frequency of contact with patients. Despite this, clinicians remained dedicated, and were motivated by patient progress, peer support and the opportunity to prove the worth of speech language pathology. They were positive about the perceived benefits of patient confidence, clinician development, teamwork, and the relationships that formed between patients, carers and clinicians. Conclusions: Clinicians agreed that delivering the treatment brought great rewards and benefits, but also challenges. Communicating the benefits and finding ways to address the barriers identified by the participants of this study may be instrumental in assisting future implementation of high intensity models of aphasia treatment in existing services.

Although treatments might draw on elements from validated therapies, questions regarding the incremental efficacy of new approaches persist. Three novel therapies that might warrant further examination include energy psychology, yoga, and brainspotting. The emergence of novel, trauma-related therapies is examined, and the history, theory, practice, and evidence base of these 3 specific therapies are outlined.

869,Work-related stress in Australia: The effects of legislative interventions and the cost of treatment,"The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data published in 2002 shows a continued rise in health care costs to the Australian community due to the growing number of people diagnosed with mental health disorders. Those mental health disorders may originate from a number of sources, including work and non-work-related factors. The so called work-related stress claims in all Australian jurisdictions are the most expensive form of workers compensation claim. In the most part this is due to the lengthy period of absence (duration) and complicated medical care which are characteristic of these claims. In Australia, in the last decade, attempts have been made to reduce the costs of compensable stress-related claims by imposing special legislative thresholds on such claims. This 'back end' approach to cost reduction has resulted in an array of legislative formula designed to exclude work-related stress claims. This article surveys the various legislative provisions dealing with work-related stress claims in Australia and provides an analysis of their effectiveness. A range of options are presented as alternatives to the exclusion of particular forms of work-related stress claims. The use of a corporate citizenship approach to the prevention and management of stress claims is also discussed as a proactive alternative to occupational safety and health legislative provisions and the workers compensation legislative exclusions.

870,"Active multimodal psychotherapy in children and adolescents with suicidality: Description, evaluation and clinical profile","The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the clinical pattern of 14 youths with presenting suicidality, to describe an integrative treatment approach, and to estimate therapy effectiveness. Fourteen patients aged 10 to 18 years from a child and adolescent outpatient clinic in Stockholm were followed in a case series. The patients were treated with active multimodal psychotherapy. This consisted of mood charting by mood-maps, psycho-education, wellbeing practice and trauma resolution. Active techniques were psychodrama and body-mind focused techniques including eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. The patients were assessed before treatment, immediately after treatment and at 22 months post treatment with the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. The clinical pattern of the group was observed. After treatment there was a significant change towards normality in the Global Assessment of Functioning scale both immediately post-treatment and at 22 months. A clinical pattern, post trauma suicidal reaction, was observed with a combination of suicidality, insomnia, bodily symptoms and disturbed mood regulation. We conclude that in the post trauma reaction suicidality might be a presenting symptom in young people. Despite the shortcomings of a case series the results of this study suggest that a mood-map-based multimodal treatment approach with active techniques might be of value in the treatment of children and youth with suicidality.

871,Neurocognitive Correlates of Successful Treatment of PTSD in Female Veterans,"Background: The influence of psychotherapy on neurocognition in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has not been examined methodically. This is despite evidence that pre-treatment learning and memory has been associated with treatment success and that executive function theories emphasize weak executive functions (especially inhibition/switching) are associated with PTSD. Objectives: To determine (1) if higher pre-treatment learning/memory, inhibition/switching, or both predict treatment success; and (2) if treatment success is associated with specific improvement in inhibition/switching and not learning/memory or working memory, another aspect of executive function. Methods: Pre-treatment neurocognition and neurocognitive changes (inhibition/switching, learning/memory, working memory) were examined in female veterans with PTSD. They were evaluated before and after 16-weeks of group psychotherapy for PTSD that included three counterbalanced modules (cognitive restructuring therapy, exposure therapy, skills training) with fidelity checks for therapist adherence. Results: Only pre-treatment learning/memory predicted better treatment outcome. Treatment success was associated with improvement in inhibition/switching only, even after controlling for mild traumatic brain injury, and changes in depressive symptoms, working memory, and learning/memory. Conclusions: Our finding that learning/memory predicted treatment success is consistent with previous studies. We extended these studies by showing that the effect was restricted to learning/memory, which is contrary to the executive function theory of PTSD. In contrast, the fact that only inhibition/switching significantly improved with better treatment success is consistent with its potential importance in maintaining PTSD symptoms. Future research should determine whether inhibition/switching abilities are a risk for development and maintenance of PTSD or whether such abilities have a broader reciprocal relationship with PTSD symptom change.

872,Acceptance and commitment therapy - Do we know enough? Cumulative and sequential meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials,"Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has accrued a substantial evidence base. Recent systematic and meta-analytic reviews suggest that ACT is effective compared to control conditions. However, these reviews appraise the efficacy of ACT across a broad range of presenting problems, rather than addressing specific common mental health difficulties. Focussing on depression and anxiety we performed a meta-analysis of trials of ACT. We incorporated sequential meta-analysis (SMA) techniques to critically appraise the sufficiency of the existing evidence base. Findings suggest that ACT demonstrates at least moderate group and pre-post effects for symptom reductions for both anxiety and depression. However using SMA findings are more qualified. There is currently insufficient evidence to confidently conclude that ACT for anxiety is efficacious when compared to active control conditions or as primary treatment for anxiety. Similarly, using SMA, there is currently insufficient evidence to suggest a moderate efficacy of ACT for depression compared to active control conditions. To stimulate further research we offer specific estimates of additional numbers of participants required to reach sufficiency to help inform future studies. We also discuss the appropriate strategies for future research into ACT for anxiety given the current evidence suggests no differential efficacy of ACT in the treatment of anxiety compared to active control conditions.

873,Stress Prevention@Work: A study protocol for the evaluation of a multifaceted integral stress prevention strategy to prevent employee stress in a healthcare organization: A cluster controlled trial,"Background: Adequate implementation of work-related stress management interventions can reduce or prevent work-related stress and sick leave in organizations. We developed a multifaceted integral stress-prevention strategy for organizations from several sectors that includes a digital platform and collaborative learning network. The digital platform contains a stepwise protocol to implement work-related stress-management interventions. It includes stress screeners, interventions and intervention providers to facilitate access to and the selection of matching work-related stress-management interventions. The collaborative learning network, including stakeholders from various organizations, plans meetings focussing on an exchange of experiences and good practices among organizations for the implementation of stress prevention measures. This paper describes the design of an integral stress-prevention strategy, Stress Prevention@Work, and the protocol for the evaluation of: 1) the effects of the strategy on perceived stress and work-related outcomes, and 2) the barriers and facilitators for implementation of the strategy. Methods: The effectiveness of Stress Prevention@Work will be evaluated in a cluster controlled trial, in a large healthcare organization in the Netherlands, at six and 12 months. An independent researcher will match teams on working conditions and size and allocate the teams to the intervention or control group. Teams in the intervention group will be offered Stress Prevention@Work. For each intervention team, one employee is responsible for applying the strategy within his/her team using the digital platform and visiting the collaborative learning network. Using a waiting list design, the control group will be given access to the strategy after 12 months. The primary outcome is the employees' perceived stress measured by the stress subscale of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Secondary outcome measures are job demands, job resources and the number of preventive stress measures implemented at the team level. Alongside the trial, a process evaluation, including barriers and facilitators of the implementation of Stress Prevention@Work, will be conducted in one healthcare organisation. Discussion: If Stress Prevention@Work is found to be effective in one healthcare organisation, further implementation on a broader scale might lead to increased productivity and decreased stress and sick leave in other organizations.

874,Self-help for stress and burnout without therapist contact: An online randomised controlled trial,"Interventions designed to reduce stress and burnout may be costly and access is limited. This study examined the effectiveness of a self-help book, using Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) to target stress and burnout in a randomised controlled online trial without any therapist contact. Participants were recruited through a newsletter of a health insurance company. Participants (N = 119) who reported at least moderate levels of stress were randomly assigned to an immediate intervention (n = 61) or a waitlist group (n = 58). Measures before and after the intervention assessed stress, burnout (primary outcomes), depression, well-being, emotion regulation (secondary outcomes) and ACT-specific constructs. Compared to the waitlist group, participants in the immediate intervention group reported lower stress and burnout and higher psychological flexibility at post-assessment. Effects between groups were large for stress (d = 0.9), moderate to large for burnout (d = 0.5â€“0.8) and large for psychological flexibility (d = 0.8). All primary and most secondary outcomes and ACT processes continued to improve in the 3-month-follow-up period. Results suggest that an ACT self-help book without any therapist contact is effective in reducing stress and burnout for various occupations. Thus, it may provide a cost-effective public health intervention for reducing stress and burnout.

We used a ""non-equivalent dependent variable design"" (Cook and Campbell, Quasi-experimentation: design and analysis for field settings, p. 118, 1979) with perceived stress and perceived control of time as dependent variables, which should be influenced by the training, and demands as control variable, which should not be changed. As expected, perceived stress decreased and perceived control of time increased after training, whereas demands did not change. Therefore, time management training might be beneficial for undergraduate students' well-being. Nevertheless, more intervention studies in this field are necessary, especially with lager samples, to contribute to more robust results and conclusions.","Hafner, A; Stock, A; Oberst, V",0,10.1007/s10212-014-0229-2,663
876,Distress in Couples Coping With Cancer: A Meta-Analysis and Critical Review of Role and Gender Effects,"Research concerning distress in couples coping with cancer was integrated using meta-analysis and narrative critical appraisal. Individual levels of distress were determined more by gender than by the role of being the person with cancer versus that person's partner. That is, women reported consistently more distress than men regardless of their role (standardized mean difference = 0.31). The association between patient and partner distress within couples was only moderate (r = .29) but is sufficient to warrant further consideration of the notion that these couples react as an emotional system rather than as individuals. It is noteworthy that this association is not moderated by gender. With a general lack of comparison groups, the question of how much distress can be ascribed to the cancer experience cannot be answered decisively; elevations in distress are probably modest. We critically discuss these results, identify important unanswered questions, and indicate directions for future research. Attention needs to be directed toward factors other than cancer as direct influences of distress in these couples and to mediators and moderators of the cancer experience.

877,Effects of a wearable type lumbosacral support for low back pain among hospital workers: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: To examine the effects of a new wearable type of lumbosacral support on low back pain. Methods: A total of 121 healthcare workers participated in this study. They were randomly allocated into the experimental and control groups and the former wore the support with signals of compression on the back by poor posture for the first 3 months. The control group remained on a waiting list for the first 3 months. Medical history, musculoskeletal symptoms, feeling in good posture, sleep habits, psychological distress, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, and Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SSAS) were evaluated. The range of motion (ROM) in the shoulder and hip joints as well as spinal alignment were evaluated. Our primary concern was the difference in the change of low back pain measured by visual analog scale (VAS) between the two groups. Results: A total of 54 participants in the experimental and 53 participants in the control groups were analyzed. VAS and SSAS scores as well as lumbar spinal ROM in the experimental group significantly decreased. Low back pain (OR=0.401, 95% CI=0.168-0.954) and neck pain in the experimental group (OR=0.198, 95% CI=0.052-0.748) significantly decreased. Conclusions: The new lumbar support reduced VAS and SSAS scores, lumbar spinal ROM, low back pain, and neck pain. This new type of lumbar support reduced low back pain among healthcare workers.","Hagiwara, Yoshihiro; Yabe, Yutaka; Yamada, Hiroyuki; Watanabe, Takashi; Kanazawa, Kenji; Koide, Masashi; Sekiguchi, Takuya; Hatano, Hirokazu; Itoi, Eiji",0,10.1539/joh.16-0203-OA,665
878,"Learning How To Recover From Job Stress: Effects of a Recovery Training Program on Recovery, Recovery-Related Self-Efficacy, and Well-Being","This quasi-experimental study evaluated the effects of a recovery training program on recovery experiences (psychological detachment from work, relaxation, mastery experiences, and control during off-job time), recovery-related self-efficacy, and well-being outcomes. The training comprised two sessions held one week apart. Recovery experiences, recovery-related self-efficacy, and well-being outcomes were measured before the training (T1) and one week (T2) and three weeks (T3) after the training. A training group consisting of 48 individuals and a waitlist control group of 47 individuals were compared (N = 95). Analyses of covariance revealed an increase in recovery experiences at T2 and T3 (for mastery only at T2). Recovery-related self-efficacy and sleep quality increased at T2 and T3, perceived stress and state negative affect decreased at T3. No training effects were found for emotional exhaustion.

880,Reducing occupational psychological distress: a randomized controlled trial of a mailed intervention,"There are increasing levels of psychological distress among general practitioners (GPs). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a mailed intervention to reduce distress among 'at-risk' GPs. A questionnaire was sent to 1356 GPs from eight Divisions of General Practice. Out of 819 (60%) who responded, 233 GPs were recruited with scores indicative of psychological distress. These GPs were randomized to intervention (n = 120) or control (n = 113). The intervention consisted of a simple letter feeding back and interpreting the psychological score together with a self-help sheet. During the study, an educational program was offered to GPs by Divisions of General Practice. The main outcome measure used was changes in psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire 12) score after 3 months. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Initial analysis of the data showed borderline significance (P = 0.05). However, analysis of the data post hoc excluding GPs who participated in the educational program showed a significant reduction in psychological distress (P = 0.03). It appears that there may have been a dilution of the intervention effect. Mailed interventions are a cost-effective way of reaching at-risk GPs and may contribute to a reduction in psychological morbidity.","Holt, Jackie; Del Mar, Chris",1,10.1093/her/cyh076,667
881,A stress management intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes,"PURPOSE The purpose of this project was to examine the effectiveness of a stress management training program in helping adolescents with diabetes cope with stress. METHODS Youths who displayed evidence of metabolic control problems received training in the use of both cognitive-restructuring and problem-solving strategies. Treatment impact was assessed on measures of coping, anxiety level, diabetes-specific stress, and metabolic control. RESULTS Analyses of covariance showed no differences between the training group and a control group at posttest and follow-up. However, the small sample sire and within-group variability may have precluded finding significant results. Therefore, within-group comparisons were conducted, and improvements were found in the training group on pretest to posttest and pretest to follow-up comparisons for anxiety, stress, and coping measures. No differences were found in the control group. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest that the intervention had some positive impact, although this interpretation must be considered preliminary. Future research should replicate this study and explore the applicability and effectiveness of this intervention in specific populations.","Hains, AA; Davies, WH; Parton, E; Totka, J; Amoroso-Camarata, J",0,10.1177/014572170002600309,668
883,Predicting return to work following treatment of chronic pain disorder,"Background The care of injured workers with chronic pain remains an important public health issue given its increasing prevalence. The consequences often include loss of self-esteem and stress in family relationships.Aims To report our interdisciplinary approach to the care of chronic pain disorder (CPD) and describe the predictors associated with a successful return to work (RTW).Methods Relevant covariates, including demographic data, time from injury, and functional scores were recorded for clients injured at work in Ontario, Canada. Our primary outcome, RTW, was assessed at 3 months post-discharge. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to identify those factors predicting a successful RTW.Results Of the injured workers who participated in the interdisciplinary CPD treatment programme, 1002 clients met our inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Fifty-five per cent were male with a mean age of 46 years. Median time from injury to treatment was 720 days. At 3 months post-treatment, 136 (14%) of the participants were working. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that earlier time since injury (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.92) and presence of an RTW coordinator (RTWC) (OR = 3.42, 95% CI 2.08-5.63) were significant predictors of successful RTW. There was also a significant interaction between RTWC involvement and time since injury. The latter did not appear to influence the likelihood of RTW when an RTWC was present.Conclusions Workers compensation boards should refer injured workers with CPD to treatment programmes as early as possible to achieve a successful RTW. Additionally, RTWCs play an important role in improving work outcomes.","Hamer, H.; Gandhi, R.; Wong, S.; Mahomed, N. N.",0,10.1093/occmed/kqt019,669
884,Multimodal patient education program with stress management for childhood and adolescent asthma,"The present study aimed to evaluate a multimodal patient education program carried out during inpatient rehabilitation. The program included cognitive-behavioral stress management training as a main component. The efficacy was examined in comparison to an education program without stress management. In total N = 68 patients aged between 8 and 16 years were included in the post-treatment and N = 46 patients in the 6 months follow-up assessment. Short- and long-term intervention effects of the multimodal education program were observed in relation to patients' age. The experimental treatment elicited significant improvements in adaptive coping in adolescents aged from 14 to 16 years. In contrast, substantial effects were not yielded for the control treatment. The results suggest that the multimodal patient education training has beneficial effects on stress management in adolescents with asthma. Results are discussed with regard to predictive factors for rehabilitation outcome. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

886,Effects of social supports on burden in caregivers of people with dementia,"Background: Social support programs for dementia caregivers were widely used in order to reduce care burden. We investigated which types of social supports can reduce psychological and non-psychological burdens of dementia caregivers, and explored the mechanism of those social supports. Methods: We evaluated 731 community-dwelling dementia patients and their caregivers from the National Survey of Dementia Care in South Korea. We investigated the five types of social supports (emotional support, informational support, tangible support, positive social interaction, affectionate support) using the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey in each caregiver. The mechanisms of specific types of social support on psychological/non-psychological burden were examined using path analysis. Results: Positive social interaction and affectionate support reduced psychological burden via direct and indirect paths. Tangible support reduced the non-psychological burden via direct and indirect paths. Informational support and emotional support were not helpful for reducing psychological or non-psychological burden. A maximum of 20% of psychological burden could be relieved by positive social interaction and 10.3% of that could be reduced by affectionate support. Tangible support was associated with a 15.1% maximal improvement in non-psychological burden. Conclusions: In order to reduce caregiver burden in dementia effectively, psychosocial interventions should be tailored to target type of caregiver burden.

887,The effect of an integrated stress management program on the psychologic and physiologic stress reactions of peptic ulcer in Korea,"The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of an integrated stress management program on symptoms of stress and ulcer healing in a sample of Koreans at a major medical center in Seoul, Korea. The study employed an experimental design with two treatment groups. One treatment group (n = 23) participated in an integrated stress management program that consisted of seven 1 h sessions over a 4-week period. A second treatment group (n = 24) was only given a tape on progressive muscle relaxation. Data were collected over a 4-month period on 47 subjects. Participants were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups. Symptoms of stress were measured by the symptoms of stress scale (Kogan, Self-regulation on Stress Reaction by Biofeedback, Korean Psychiatric Academic Society, Korea) translated into Korean. Stage of ulcer healing was evaluated by a physician using an endoscope. Physiologic stress reactions were measured by biofeedback equipment. The integrated stress management program treatment group reported significantly lower stress symptom scores than the progressive muscle relaxation-only group (t = 3.66, P<0.001). The integrated stress management group also demonstrated a greater improvement in ulcer healing than the progressive muscle relaxation group (t = 1.95, P<0.05). The integrated stress management program was more effective in decreasing self-reported stress symptoms and resulted in a more significant ulcer healing than the progressive muscle relaxation treatment.

888,A controlled clinical evaluation of the Parents Plus Children's Programme for parents of children aged 6-12 with mild intellectual disability in a school setting,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the parent training, Parents Plus Children's Programme (PPCP) as an intervention for parents of children with mild intellectual disabilities. Participants were parents of children, aged six to 12, attending a special school for children with mild general learning disability (n = 29). Minor programme adaptations were made. Pre and post-assessment included the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Parenting Stress Index, the Kansas Parent Satisfaction Scale and parent identified personal and child-related goals. A significant reduction in clinical range scores for treatment group participants (n = 16) was observed. Conversely, clinical range scores for control group participants (n = 13) increased, or remained elevated. These preliminary results suggest that PPCP may be successfully delivered as a routine community-based intervention and aid to prevent and reduce behavioural problems, reduce parent stress and increase parent confidence and satisfaction. Further investigation of programme effectiveness for parents of children with developmental disability is warranted.

A general self-efficacy questionnaire, trait anxiety inventory, and coping inventory were administered prior to the start of the training, at post treatment, and at 2-month follow-up. Both treatments significantly reduced trait anxiety and increased self-efficacy at post treatment. These changes were maintained at follow-up. As expected, adaptive coping strategies increased at posttreatement for both groups. Maladaptive coping strategy means were reduced in the expected direction for the cognitive group only from pre-test to follow-up. Limitations of this study and future implications are discussed.","Haney, CJ",0,,674

893,Brief report on the psychophysiological effects of a yoga intervention for chronic stress: Preliminary findings,"This paper evaluates the results of a longitudinal investigation of the potential benefits of yoga in a nonclinical sample of chronically stressed women (N = 116). Women undertook a twice weekly, hour-long yoga class for a period of 2 months, measuring psychological and physical indicators of health periodically. Changes in both areas were compared against a wait-list control group. The reported energy expenditure between groups was estimated to be similar, which suggests that the control group engaged in physical activities other than yoga. Of the six psychological outcomes measured, we found improvements in three. Specifically, those in the practicing yoga group experienced increases in positive affect, decreases in levels of distress and stress, as well as a decrease in waist circumference and increased flexibility. No between-group differences were found in mindfulness, well-being, and negative affect. These findings are generally consistent with an emerging literature, suggesting that yoga may provide both psychological and physiological effects that extend beyond its more obvious physical benefits, and are discussed in terms of the bodyâ€™s allostatic load. These results should be considered in light of this studyâ€™s limitations, which include its small sample size, lack of an â€œactiveâ€ control group, and female-only participants.

894,In the best interests of society,"Each year, exposure to violent trauma takes its toll on the development of millions of children. When their trauma goes unaddressed, children are at greater risk for school failure; anxiety and depression and other post-traumatic disorders; alcohol and drug abuse, and, later in life, engaging in violence similar to that to which they were originally exposed. In spite of the serious psychiatric/developmental sequelae of violence exposure, the majority of severely and chronically traumatized children and youth are not found in mental health clinics. Instead, they typically are seen as the 'trouble-children' in schools or emerge in the child protective, law enforcement, substance abuse treatment, and criminal justice systems, where the root of their problems in exposure to violence and abuse is typically not identified or addressed. Usually, providers in all of these diverse service systems have not been sufficiently trained to know and identify the traumatic origins of the children's presenting difficulties and are not sufficiently equipped to assist with their remediation. This multiplicity of traumatic manifestations outside the mental health setting leads to the inescapable conclusion that we are dealing with a supra-clinical problem that can only be resolved by going beyond the child's individual clinical needs to enlist a range of coordinated services for the child and the family. This paper will focus on domestic violence as a paradigmatic source of violent traumatization and will (a) describe the impact and consequences of exposure to violence on children's immediate and long-term development; (b) examine the opportunities for, as well as the barriers to, bridging the clinical phenomena of children's violent trauma and the existing systems of care that might best meet their needs; and (c) critique current national policies that militate against a more rational and coherent approach to addressing these needs.

Rehabilitation goals have changed to include improving patients' tolerance for work and activity and avoiding illness behaviors and chronicity in addition to reducing pain. Treatment recommendations for acute and subacute patients are based on results from prospective, randomized controlled trials, and comparison studies. For patients with short-term disabilities, maintenance of activity and work status and prevention of deconditioning is stressed. For subacute patients, quota-based exercise with behavioral management is prescribed. These methods produce superior outcomes compared with more passive interventions.","Hartigan, C; Miller, L; Liewehr, SC",0,,678
896,Stress reduction at the work-family interface: Positive parenting and self-efficacy as mechanisms of change in workplace Triple P,"Workplace Triple P (WPTP) is a group-based parenting skills training specifically designed to meet the needs of employed parents. Several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the training's efficacy. This study examined possible mechanisms of change that account for the stress reduction effects of this parenting skills training at the work-family interface. It was hypothesized that reductions in dysfunctional parenting (DP) behavior and increases in parental self-efficacy would mediate the stress-reducing effects of WPTP. The mediator effects were analyzed in a German pre- and postcompleter sample (N = 97 parents; 74 mothers and 23 fathers; treatment condition: n = 42 parents; waitlist-control condition n = 55 parents). The results indicate that individual stress- (IS) level reductions were mediated by decreased levels of DP. In addition, changes in IS levels mediated the effects of the training on work-related stress. The discussion focuses on the importance of understanding mechanisms of change to effectively implement interventions at the work-family interface.

898,Effects of a Support Program on Nurses' Communication with Hospitalized Children's Families,"More than a few pediatric nurses experience difficulty in communicating with children's family members. However, effective means of providing communication support for pediatric nurses have not been examined sufficiently. This study aimed to develop and implement a communication support program for nurses to facilitate improved communication with families of hospitalized children, and to clarify changes in nurses' recognition and behavior toward communication with families in clinical settings. The program lasted 6 months and consisted of lectures, role-play, 4 communication models in which nurses experienced difficulty communicating with family members, and continued individual support. The effects of the program were evaluated qualitatively and descriptively using semi-structured interviews. A total of 7 nurses with less than 5 years of pediatric nursing experience completed the program. Subsequent to program completion, nurses' awareness of careful communication with families increased, and they began to approach families actively using thoughtful words. Furthermore, as nurses received favorable reactions from families, they realized that communication was interactive and recognized that their perception of their communication skills as poor had changed. This program could contribute in reducing nurses' difficulty in communicating with families and encourage them to improve their communication.","Hashimoto, Hiroko",0,10.1080/24694193.2017.1307473,680
900,Relationship Between Meditation Depth and Waking Salivary Alpha-Amylase Secretion Among Long-Term MBSR Instructors,"The purpose of this study was to characterize sympathetic activity by using waking salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) concentrations in a group of long-term meditation instructors and to examine the association between meditation (depth, dose and duration) and the waking alpha-amylase response. Salivary alpha-amylase samples were collected (immediately upon waking and at 15-min, 30-min and 45-min intervals after waking) from mindfulness-based stress reduction instructors to determine both the area under the curve and the awakening slope (difference in alpha-amylase concentrations between waking and 30-min post-waking). It was determined through general linear models that neither years of meditation nor meditation dose were associated with the awakening sAA slope, but higher scores for meditation depth (greater depth) was associated with a more negative (or steeper) awakening slope [Quartile (Q)1: âˆ’7 versus Q4: âˆ’21 U/mL; p = 0.06], in fully adjusted models. Older age (p = 0.04) and a later time of waking (p < 0.01) also were associated with less negative awakening slope values. Smoking was associated with lower area under the curve values (smokers: 1716 U/mL versus nonsmokers: 2107 U/mL; p = 0.05) in fully adjusted models. The results suggest a â€˜healthyâ€™ sAA waking slope among individuals who meditate more deeply. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

901,Practitioner review: Stress intervention for parents of children with intellectual disabilities,"Background: Parents of children with intellectual disabilities are at increased risk for stress and other mental health problems. The purpose of the present review is to consider the evidence base for psychological intervention to remediate stress in these parents. Methods: A selective review of interventions designed to reduce stress in parents of children with intellectual disabilities, with a focus on group interventions that incorporate various cognitive behavioural techniques. Results: Research evidence suggests that standard service models (e.g., respite care, case management) probably help to reduce parental stress. The strongest evidence base is for cognitive behavioural group interventions, especially for the reduction of stress in mothers. Some data also indicate the potential value of parent-led support networks. Conclusions: More research and clinical development are needed to establish a firmer evidence base for stress interventions with parents of children with intellectual disabilities. There are also a number of potential practical implications of reducing parental stress for maximising the efficacy of general parent training interventions and also behavioural programmes for children's challenging behaviours.

902,The Potential for Mindfulness-Based Intervention in Workplace Mental Health Promotion: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial,"ObjectivesThis study aims to intensively evaluate the effectiveness of mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) on mental illness risks (including psychological distress, prolonged fatigue, and perceived stress) and job strain (job control and job demands) for employees with poor mental health.MethodsA longitudinal research design was adopted. In total, 144 participants were randomized to the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group participated in MBI for eight weeks. Measurements were collected for both groups at five time points: at pre-intervention (T1), at mid-intervention (T2), at the completion of intervention (T3), four weeks after intervention (T4), and eight weeks after intervention (T5). Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. A linear mixed model with two levels was employed to analyze the repeated measurement data.ResultsCompared with the control group, the intercepts (means at T3) for the intervention group were significantly lower on psychological distress, prolonged fatigue, and perceived stress when MBI was completed. Even with the demographic variables controlled, the positive effects remained. For growth rates of prolonged fatigue and perceived stress, participants in the intervention group showed a steeper decrease than did the participants in the control group. Regarding job strain, although the intercept (mean at T3) of job demands showed a significant decline when BMI was completed, the significance disappeared when the demographic variables were controlled. Moreover, the other results for job control and job demands did not show promising findings.ConclusionAs a workplace health promotion program, the MBI seems to have potential in improving mental illness risks for employees with poor mental health. However, there was insufficient evidence to support its effect on mitigating job strain. Further research on maintaining the positive effects on mental health for the long term and on developing innovative MBI to suit job strain are recommended.","Huang, Shu-Ling; Li, Ren-Hau; Huang, Feng-Ying; Tang, Feng-Cheng",1,10.1371/journal.pone.0138089,683

904,To debrief or not to debrief our heroes: That is the question,"Psychological debriefing was developed in the 1980s as an approach for use with people whose work exposes them to stressful incidents. It aims to help them to process the thoughts and emotions arising from their work. Subsequently, several randomized controlled trials tested truncated forms of debriefing in a different population: primary victims of unexpected trauma. These trials, and particularly two in which debriefing appeared to be harmful, led two major reviews to warn practitioners not to offer debriefing. Consequently, many organizations have stopped providing debriefing to employees who face trauma in their routine work. This paper argues that there are at least three reasons for the apparent failure of 'debriefing' in the two studies that reported adverse effects. First, the 'debriefing' did not follow protocol in terms of timing, length, and training and independence of the debriefer. Second, the patients who were 'debriefed' reported more severe initial symptoms than those who were not. Third, 'debriefing' was used with individuals for whom it was not originally intended. Psychological debriefing is intended to be used with groups of people who have been briefed together before going on to work together in stressful situations. Such groups have reported that they find psychological debriefing helpful, and research is emerging indicating that appropriate debriefing may indeed benefit these groups. We call for reviewers to recognize the limitations of debriefing research and not to overgeneralize their conclusions.

906,Levels of trauma among women inmates with HIV risk and alcohol use disorders: Behavioral and emotional impacts,"An increasing number of women are involved in the criminal justice system. Women in corrections are often of low socioeconomic status, medically underserved and exposed to a variety of traumatic events. Programs and services provided in correctional settings should be informed by the unique profiles and needs of these women. This study sought to identify distinct sub-groups (classes) of incarcerated women based on differences in their qualitative (types of trauma) and quantitative (number of) trauma experiences. Demographics, psychosocial and behavioral characteristics were measured in 149 women entering jail, who reported recent hazardous drinking and HIV sexual risk behavior. Two classes based on trauma exposure of women were identified through latent class analysis. The classes did not differ with respect to qualitative differences in trauma exposure (both classes reported all forms of trauma), but did differ with respect to quantitative differences (Class 2 reported more exposure to trauma in all categories than Class 1). The classes also differed significantly on current psychological functioning, alcohol treatment, problems, and consequences, drug histories, sexual risk, medical conditions, and social group characteristics. In all areas, members of Class 2 were significantly more likely to report higher levels of measured variables. Nearly all women in our sample reported levels of trauma exposure, suggesting a need for intervention and attention. Through identifying these separate classes, limited resources for trauma survivors in the correctional setting could be most appropriately allocated. Â© 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Few studies have examined the effectiveness of meditation programs offered to Veterans within Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mental health services. The current study addresses this gap using data from a multisite VA demonstration project. Method: Evaluation data collected at 6 VA sites (N = 391 Veterans) before and after a meditation program, and a treatment-as-usual (TAU) program, were examined here using random effects meta-analyses. Site-specific and aggregate between group effect sizes comparing meditation programs to TAU were determined for PTSD severity measured by clinical interview and self-report. Additional outcomes included experiential avoidance and mindfulness. Results: In aggregate, analyses showed medium effect sizes for meditation programs compared to TAU for PTSD severity (clinical interview: effect size (ES) =-0.32; self-report: ES =-0.39). Similarly sized effects of meditation programs were found for overall mindfulness (ES = 0.41) and 1 specific aspect of mindfulness, nonreactivity to inner experience (ES = .37). Additional findings suggested meditation type and program completion differences each moderated program effects. Conclusions: VA-sponsored meditation programs show promise for reducing PTSD severity in Veterans receiving mental health services. Where meditation training fits within mental health services, and for whom programs will be of interest and effective, require further clarification.

908,Oxidative genome damage and its repair in neurodegenerative diseases: Function of transition metals as a double-edged sword,"The neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) with high O2 consumption and prolonged life span are chronically exposed to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accumulation of ROS-induced genome damage in the form of oxidized bases and single-strand breaks (SSBs) as well as their defective or reduced repair in the brain has been implicated in the etiology of various neurological disorders including Alzheimer's/Parkinson's diseases (AD/PD). Although inactivating mutations in some DNA repair genes have been linked to hereditary neurodegenerative diseases, the underlying mechanisms of repair deficiencies for the sporadic diseases is not understood. The ROS-induced DNA damage is predominantly repaired via the highly conserved and regulated base excision/SSB repair (BER/SSBR) pathway. We recently made an interesting discovery that the transition metals iron and copper, which accumulate excessively in the brains of AD, PD, and other neurodegenerative diseases, act as a 'double-edged sword' by inducing genotoxic ROS and inhibiting DNA damage repair at the same time. These metals inhibit the base excision activity of NEIL family DNA glycosylases by oxidizing them, changing their structure, and inhibiting their binding to downstream repair proteins. Metal chelators and reducing agents partially reverse the inhibition, while curcumin with both chelating and reducing activities reverses the inhibition nearly completely. In this review, we have discussed the possible etiological linkage of BER/SSBR defects to neurodegenerative diseases and the therapeutic potential of metal chelators in restoring DNA repair capacity.

909,Childhood maltreatment and the response to cognitive behavior therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome,"Objective: To examine the relationship between a history of childhood maltreatment and the treatment response to cognitive behavior therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Methods: A cohort study in a tertiary care clinic with a referred sample of 216 adult patients meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for CFS, and starting cognitive behavior therapy. Main outcome measures changes between pre- and post therapy in fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength fatigue subscale), disabilities (Sickness Impact Profile total score), physical functioning (short form 36 health survey subscale) and psychological distress (Symptom checklist 90 total score). Results: At baseline, patients with a history of childhood maltreatment had significantly more limitations and a higher level of psychological distress, but were not more severely fatigued. Change scores on the outcome measures after cognitive behavior therapy did not differ significantly between patients with or without a history of childhood maltreatment, or between the different types of childhood maltreatment. However, patients with a history of childhood maltreatment still experienced more limitations and a higher level of psychological distress after CBT. Conclusions: A history of childhood maltreatment was not related to the treatment response of cognitive behavior therapy for CFS. In patients with a history of childhood maltreatment CFS symptoms can be treated with CBT just as well as those without.

911,Exercise training for adults with chronic kidney disease,"BackgroundChronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. In the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines it is stressed that lifestyle issues such as physical activity should be seen as cornerstones of the therapy. The physical fitness in adults with CKD is so reduced that it impinges on ability and capacity to perform activities in everyday life and occupational tasks. An increasing number of studies have been published regarding health effects of various regular exercise programmes in adults with CKD and in renal transplant patients.ObjectivesWe aimed to: 1) assess the effects of regular exercise in adults with CKD and kidney transplant patients; and 2) determine how the exercise programme should be designed (e.g. type, duration, intensity, frequency of exercise) to be able to affect physical fitness and functioning, level of physical activity, cardiovascular dimensions, nutrition, lipids, glucose metabolism, systemic inflammation, muscle morphology and morphometrics, dropout rates, compliance, adverse events and mortality.Search strategyWe searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Biosis, Pedro, Amed, AgeLine, PsycINFO and KoreaMed. We also handsearched reference lists of review articles and included studies, conference proceeding's abstracts. There were no language restrictions.Date of last search: May 2010.Selection criteriaWe included any randomised controlled trial (RCT) enrolling adults with CKD or kidney transplant recipients undergoing any type of physical exercise intervention undertaken for eight weeks or more. Studies using less than eight weeks exercise, those only recommending an increase in physical activity, and studies in which co-interventions are not applied or given to both groups were excluded.Data collection and analysisData extraction and assessment of study and data quality were performed independently by the two authors. Continuous outcome data are presented as standardised mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Main resultsForty-five studies, randomising 1863 participants were included in this review. Thirty two studies presented data that could be meta-analysed. Types of exercise training included cardiovascular training, mixed cardiovascular and resistance training, resistance-only training and yoga. Some studies used supervised exercise interventions and others used unsupervised interventions. Exercise intensity was classed as 'high' or 'low', duration of individual exercise sessions ranged from 20 minutes/session to 110 minutes/session, and study duration was from two to 18 months. Seventeen per cent of studies were classed as having an overall low risk of bias, 33% as moderate, and 49% as having a high risk of bias.The results shows that regular exercise significantly improved: 1) physical fitness (aerobic capacity, 24 studies, 847 participants: SMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.42; walking capacity, 7 studies, 191 participants: SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.06); 2) cardiovascular dimensions (resting diastolic blood pressure, 11 studies, 419 participants: MD 2.32 mm Hg, 95% CI 0.59 to 4.05; resting systolic blood pressure, 9 studies, 347 participants: MD 6.08 mm Hg, 95% CI 2.15 to 10.12; heart rate, 11 studies, 229 participants: MD 6 bpm, 95% CI 10 to 2); 3) some nutritional parameters (albumin, 3 studies, 111 participants: MD -2.28 g/L, 95% CI -4.25 to -0.32; pre-albumin, 3 studies, 111 participants: MD -44.02 mg/L, 95% CI -71.52 to -16.53; energy intake, 4 studies, 97 participants: SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.05); and 4) health-related quality of life. Results also showed how exercise should be designed in order to optimise the effect. Other outcomes had insufficient evidence.Authors' conclusionsThere is evidence for significant beneficial effects of regular exercise on physical fitness, walking capacity, cardiovascular dimensions (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate), health-related quality of life and some nutritional parameters in adults with CKD. Other outcomes had insufficient evidence due to the lack of data from RCTs. The design of the exercise intervention causes difference in effect size and should be considered when prescribing exercise with the aim of affecting a certain outcome. Future RCTs should focus more on the effects of resistance training interventions or mixed cardiovascular- and resistance training as these exercise types have not been studied as much as cardiovascular exercise.","Heiwe, Susanne; Jacobson, Stefan H.",0,10.1002/14651858.CD003236.pub2,690
912,Happiness and its relation to psychological well-being of adolescents,"In the present decade, adolescents' mental problems are known as critical problems which have many destructive consequences. This study aimed to measure students' happiness and psychological well-being status in a sample of high school students. The cross sectional study consisted of 403 randomly selected high school students in Tabriz, Iran. Numerous variables including general health status, happiness, self-efficacy, perceived stress, hopefulness and life satisfaction were measured by using self-reported written questionnaires. Significant relation observed between happiness and psychological well-being (r= 0.48). Those students with good relationship and those who had reported to enjoy attending social events indicated better mental health status. No causal inferences were investigated due to the non-experimental nature of the study. The findings also revealed that students with higher happiness score have a better school performance. Integration of happiness promotion initiatives into the comprehensive school health programs is recommended to have pleasant environments for a healthy population of adolescents.

914,"Lack of effectiveness of a multidisciplinary fall-prevention program in elderly people at risk: A randomized, controlled trial","OBJECTIVES: To assess whether a pragmatic multidisciplinary fall-prevention program was more effective than usual care in preventing new falls and functional decline in elderly people.DESIGN: A two-group, randomized, controlled trial with 12 months of follow-up.SETTING: University hospital and home-based intervention, the Netherlands.PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred thirty-three community-dwelling Dutch people aged 65 and over who were seen in an emergency department after a fall.INTERVENTION: Participants in the intervention group underwent a detailed medical and occupational-therapy assessment to evaluate and address risk factors for recurrent falls, followed by recommendations and referral if indicated. People in the control group received usual care.MEASUREMENTS: Number of people sustaining a fall (fall calendar) and daily functioning (Frenchay Activity Index).RESULTS: Results showed no statistically significantly favorable effects on falls (odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-1.49) or daily functioning (regression coefficient = 0.37, CI = -0.90 to 1.63) after 12 months of follow-up.CONCLUSION: The multidisciplinary fail-prevention program was not effective in preventing falls and functional decline in this Dutch healthcare setting. Implementing the program in its present form in the Netherlands is not recommended. This trial shows that there can be considerable discrepancy between the ""ideal"" (expert mental) version of a program and the implemented version of the same program. The importance of research in assessing feasibility and effectiveness of such a program in a specific healthcare setting is therefore stressed.","Hendriks, Marike R. C.; Bleijlevens, Michel H.

915,Early attachment-figure separation and increased risk for later depression: Potential mediation by proinflammatory processes,Early maternal separation and other disruptions of attachment relations are known to increase risk for the later onset of depressive illness in vulnerable individuals. It is suggested here that sensitization involving proinflammatory processes may contribute to this effect. This argument is based on: (1) current notions of the role of proinflammatory cytokines in depressive illness; (2) evidence that proinflammatory cytokines mediate depressive-like behavior during separation in a rodent model of infant attachment; and (3) comparisons of the effects of early proinflammatory activation versus maternal separation on later proinflammatory activity and biobehavioral processes related to depression. The possible interaction of proinflammatory processes and corticotropin-releasing factor in the sensitization process is discussed.

This study examines the impact of two group therapy interventions on reduction of unprotected sexual occasions (USO) among women with substance use disorders (SUD) and PTSD. Participants were 346 women recruited from and receiving treatment at six community-based drug treatment programs participating in NIDA's Clinical Trials Network. Participants were randomized to receive 12-sessions of either seeking safety (SS), a cognitive behavioral intervention for women with PTSD and SUD, or women's health education (WHE), an attention control psychoeducational group. Participants receiving SS who were at higher sexual risk (i.e., at least 12 USO per month) significantly reduced the number of USO over 12-month follow up compared to WHE. High risk women with co-occurring PTSD and addiction may benefit from treatment addressing coping skills and trauma to reduce HIV risk.

Its importance as a complement of traditional academic education, as well as its potential for Pharmaceutical Care is also discussed. Materials and methods A total of 27 students and 26 professionals took part in a program of 10 sessions, aimed at improving stress management. Ten of the students and 10 professionals were randomly assigned to control groups. Salivary cortisol levels and anxiety level tests before and after the program were used to assess efficacy. Results Both the cortisol and the anxiety levels significantly decreased among students and professionals after the program, whereas it significantly increased in the student control group. Anxiety levels significantly decreased in both students and professionals. Conclusions This type of pilot program proved effective for students. In the case of health professionals, the sample size needs to be increased in order to achieve an acceptable level of statistical power. Considering the shift of the pharmaceutical profession towards Pharmaceutical Care, the training of competences and attitudes like those described in this work could be of value. Â© 2013 SECA.

922,Predictors of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in people with chronic aphasia,"Background: In recent years, quality of life measures have been used increasingly to evaluate the effectiveness of services or interventions. For people with chronic disabilities, research has focused on identifying the main predictors of their health-related quality of life (HRQL), in order to address the issue of how to meet their needs in rehabilitation in a more holistic way. Aims: This study assessed the main predictors of HRQL in people with chronic aphasia following stroke. We investigated the relationship between HRQL and various demographic and stroke-related variables and other variables that have been associated with HRQL in stroke survivors (e.g., emotional distress, daily activities, social support). Methods: A cross-sectional design was adopted. A cluster sampling framework was used to recruit participants with chronic aphasia (> 1 year) from three different sites. Questionnaires and assessments on the different variables were administered to all participants by a speech and language therapist, in an interview format. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess what were the main predictors of HRQL in people with aphasia. Results: Of 95 participants, 83 (87%) were able to self-report on all the assessments. Emotional distress, involvement in home and outdoors activities, extent of communication disability, and number of comorbid conditions explained 52% of the variance in HRQL (adjusted R2 = .52). Stroke type (infarct vs haemorrhage), time post-onset, and demographic variables (gender, ethnicity, marital status, employment status, and socioeconomic status) were not significantly associated with HRQL in these participants. Conclusions: Increased distress, reduced involvement in activities, increased communication disability, and comorbidity predict poorer HRQL in people with chronic aphasia after stroke. Service providers need to take these factors into account when designing intervention programmes.","Hilari K., Wiggins R.D., Roy P., Byng S., Smith S.C.",0,10.1080/02687030244000725,697
924,Effects of web-based stress and depression literacy intervention on improving symptoms and knowledge of depression among workers: A randomized controlled trial,"Background The present randomized controlled trial aimed to examine whether a newly developed psychoeducational information website on stress and depression was effective in improving depressive symptoms at one- and four-month follow-ups among workers in Japan. Methods Participants were recruited from registered members of a web survey site in Japan. Participants who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were randomly allocated to intervention or control groups. Immediately after the baseline survey, the intervention group was invited to access a psychoeducational website named the ""UTSMed"" within 4 months after the baseline survey. Depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory II; BDI-II) were assessed as a primary outcome, at baseline, and one- and four-month follow-ups for both intervention and control groups. The analyses were conducted separately by the three subgroups (high-risk, moderate-risk, and low-risk). Results A total of 1236 workers completed the baseline survey. Participants were randomly allocated to an intervention or control group (N=618 for each), with the subgroups of high-risk (7-8%), moderate-risk (47%) and low-risk (45-46%) in each group. A significant intervention effect on improving depressive symptoms (t=-2.35, P =0.02, d=-0.57) was observed at 1-month follow-up only in the high-risk subgroup. Limitations The present study did not use a stratified permuted-block randomization. Conclusions A web-based psychoeducation approach may not be effective enough in improving depressive symptoms in a general population of workers, while it may be effective for workers who had recently sought help for mental health.

925,Aligning over the child: Parenting alliance mediates the association of autism spectrum disorder atypicality with parenting stress,"Children's symptoms of autism are robustly linked to diminished parent well-being and relationship distress, however they are less clearly linked to other aspects of family development. We focused on child atypical symptoms (i.e., behavioral stereotypies) and investigated relations to parental stress and the parenting alliance. We verified that relations between atypicality and parenting stress were partially mediated by a child-focused aspect of the parenting alliance. These results suggested that parents of highly atypical children reported less stress than parents of children with low levels of these behaviors, an effect that acted through an assessment of the parenting partner as highly involved with the child. However, parents with highly atypical children did not report a similarly better self-focused parenting alliance, indicating that direct emotional support from the partner did not differ between the groups. We discuss the possibility that, among parents who stay together in the face of severe child disability, enhanced perceptions of parenting are not uncommon.

The suffering of afflicted persons motivates development and evaluation of effective handling and treatments. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of cognitive behavioural therapy in patients with electric sensitivity. Methods: Cognitive behavioural treatment, as part of a multidisciplinary treatment package for patients with electric sensitivity, was evaluated in a controlled trial. Ten patients who received treatment were compared to 12 controls. Outcome measures included different dimensions such as symptoms, beliefs, behaviour, and biochemical measurements of stress-related variables. All outcome measures were collected prior to the study, post-treatment, and after an additional 6-month follow-up. Results: The therapy group rated their electric sensitivity as significantly lower than did the control group at the 6-month follow-up, and reduction of self-rated discomforts from triggering factors was significant in the therapy group. There were no systematic changes in the biochemical variables, The symptom indices were significantly reduced over time, and ability to work continued to be good in both groups. Conclusion: The prognosis for this syndrome is good with early intervention and cognitive therapy may further reduce the perceived hypersensitivity.

930,A randomized controlled trial of mindfulness to reduce stress and burnout among intern medical practitioners. [References].,"Introduction: Stress and burnout are highly prevalent among medical doctors, and are associated with negative consequences for doctors, patients, and organizations. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effectiveness of a mindfulness training intervention in reducing stress and burnout among medical practitioners, by means of a Randomised Controlled Trial design.
Methods: Participants were 44 intern doctors completing an emergency department rotation in a major Australian hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to either an active control (one hour extra break per week) or the 10-week mindfulness training intervention. Measures of stress and burnout were taken pre-, mid- and post intervention.
Results: Participants undergoing the 10-week mindfulness training program reported greater improvements in stress and burnout relative to participants in the control condition. Significant reduction in stress and burnout was observed for participants in the mindfulness condition. No such reductions were observed for participants in the control condition.
Conclusions: Mindfulness interventions may provide medical practitioners with skills to effectively manage stress and burnout, thereby reducing their experience of these symptoms. It is likely that doctors would benefit from the inclusion of such a training program as a part of their general medical education.

931,"A review of research on the prevalence, antecedents, consequences and prevention of workplace aggression in clinical medical practice","A broad-ranging review of the published research literature was undertaken on workplace aggression in clinical medical practice. Prevalence studies have found that 15-75% of survey respondents reported verbal aggression and 2-29% reported physical aggression in medical practice settings in the previous 6-24. months. In comparison, there was limited published research on the antecedents and consequences of clinician exposure to workplace aggression, and a dearth of published research on the prevention and minimization of workplace aggression in medical practice settings. Future research efforts need to investigate workplace aggression from all sources and across all medical clinician sub-populations in the diverse settings in which they work. Specific attention needs to be given to identifying key risk and protective factors for workplace aggression exposure, including in relation to clinician profiles, the settings and conditions of medical work, and the presence of key aggression prevention and minimization efforts, both individually and in combination. The impact of workplace aggression on clinician health, well-being, performance and work participation remains under-researched. Overall, a more extensive and robust evidence base is required to enable informed decision-making on reducing the likelihood and consequences of workplace aggression in clinical medical practice.

Methods: 8 sedentary smokers (mean Â± SD age: 20.1 Â± 1.7 y; height: 171.6 Â± 10.8. cm; body mass: 70.4 Â± 12.0. kg; smoking history: 2.9 Â± 0.8. y) completed a 24-hour ad libitum smoking trial (SMO) followed by two 24-hour smoking abstinence trials. During abstinence trials, participants performed six whole body resistance exercises (EX) or a control condition (CON) in the morning, followed by mental challenge tasks in the afternoon. Plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), and salivary and serum cortisol were measured during each visit at rest (REST), and then before (PRE-EX), immediately after (IP-EX), and 30. min after exercise (30-EX); and before (PRE-MC), immediately after (IP-MC), and 30. min after mental challenge (30-MC). Results: Resistance exercise significantly (p. â‰¤. 0.05) elevated plasma ACTH and serum cortisol at IP-EX during EX compared with SMO and CON trials. Resting ACTH, salivary and serum cortisol concentrations at Pre-MC did not differ between EX and CON trials. The HPA axis response to mental challenge was similar after EX and CON trials. Finally, resistance exercise did not reduce withdrawal symptoms, urge to smoke, or stress.

Method: Studies were included if they focused on children from birth to 18 years of age with specific or general psychiatric conditions, employed randomized designs, and examined intervention effects with a six-month or longer post-treatment assessment in treatment studies or a 6-month or longer post-baseline assessment for services studies. Two hundred (n=200) studies met criteria. Reported outcome measures were coded into conceptual categories drawn from the 1980-1995 review. Results: There was a five-fold increase in the total number of studies (38 versus 200) across the two 15-year time periods, with the largest increase in the number of studies that focused on consumer-oriented outcomes (from eight to 47 studies, an almost sixfold increase); two new domains, parent symptoms and health-related outcomes, were identified. The majority of studies (more than 95) continued to focus on symptoms and diagnoses as an outcome. Impact ratings were higher among studies examining four or more outcomes versus one to two outcomes in all categories with the exception of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Conclusions: Given major shifts in health care policy affecting mental health services, the emergence of health and parent-related outcomes as well as greater attention to consumer perspectives parallels emerging priorities in health care and can enhance the relevance of child outcome studies for implementation in the real world.

937,Posttraumatic stress symptoms predict impaired neutrophil recovery in stem cell transplant recipients,"Objective Despite the potentially life-saving effects of stem cell transplant (SCT), many transplant patients experience traumatic stress reactions due to mortality threat, interpersonal isolation, financial and occupational loss, and invasive medical procedures. Emerging evidence suggests that trauma-related stress symptoms (TSS) predict significant health complications following SCT. The aim of the current prospective study was to examine TSS in the acute aftermath of SCT as a predictor of neutrophil recovery following SCT, a crucial component of immune defense against infection. Methods Fifty-one autologous SCT recipients were assessed for TSS 7 days after SCT. Patients' absolute neutrophil counts were collected from medical charts for the first 30 days following SCT. Hierarchical linear growth modeling was used to test the hypothesis that TSS at day 7 would be associated with delayed recovery of neutrophil counts from days 9 to 30 post SCT, that is, when neutrophil counts began to recover. Results As hypothesized, TSS measured 7 days after SCT was significantly associated with slower neutrophil recovery even after pre-existing TSS, depression, distress related to physical symptoms, and potential medical confounds were statistically controlled. Exploratory analyses showed that of the TSS symptom clusters, re-experiencing symptoms and hyperarousal symptoms predicted neutrophil recovery, whereas avoidance symptoms did not. Conclusion Though traumatic stress symptoms may be a normative response to SCT, our findings suggest that TSS following SCT may interfere with neutrophil recovery and overall health. These results provide further insight as to potential mechanisms by which traumatic stress translates to poor medical outcomes for SCT patients. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

938,Evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of a self-administered manual-based stress management intervention for individuals with asthma: Results from a controlled study,"Several behavioral medicine interventions (eg, relaxation training and written emotional expression) have been proposed as effective supplemental treatments for individuals with chronic illnesses such as asthma. Whether these treatments are feasible or effective in a manual-based, self-administered format is unclear, and few studies have examined the effectiveness of such treatments presented in a complementary format. We examined the feasibility and effectiveness of a 4-week stress management treatment compared with a matched placebo intervention in young adults with asthma. Both groups considered the workbooks credible treatment interventions and completed them conscientiously. The treatment group showed significant improvement in measures of lung function compared with the placebo group, but analysis revealed no differences in measures of perceived stress. These findings provide initial support for the feasibility of self-administered manual-based interventions and some evidence that they can produce health benefits in individuals with asthma and, perhaps, other chronic conditions.","Hockemeyer J., Smyth J.",0,10.1080/08964280209596041,710
939,Experience and outcomes of stepping stones triple P for families of children with autism,"This study investigated the experience and perceived outcomes of a behavioural family intervention, standard stepping stones triple P (SSTP), for parents of children with autism. An indepth, prospective, mixed-methods, multiple case-study design was employed. Parent participants and SSTP practitioners took part. Participation in SSTP was consistently associated with improved parental self-efficacy, and was also associated with improved parental psychological well-being and decreased perceived need for behavioural services for some families. Three key themes emerged from the qualitative interview data, reflecting changes attributed to participation in SSTP: (1) changes in the ""attribution of cause"" of misbehaviour, (2) ""Who's the boss?"" reflecting a change to parents feeling more in charge of their child's behaviour, daily routines and choices, and (3) ""Rewarding is rewarding!"" reflecting appreciation of a positive approach to behaviour management. Practitioners discussed their impressions of appropriate participants, timing, structure, and session preferences for SSTP, and implications related to the professional qualifications of practitioners delivering SSTP. Clinical implications for the use of SSTP with families of children with autism are discussed. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Hodgetts S., Savage A., McConnell D.",0,10.1016/j.ridd.2013.05.005,711
940,Support during pregnancy for women at increased risk of low birthweight babies,"BackgroundStudies consistently show a relationship between social disadvantage and low birthweight. Many countries have programs offering special assistance to women thought to be at risk for giving birth to a low birthweight infant. These programs may include advice and counseling (about nutrition, rest, stress management, alcohol, and recreational drug use), tangible assistance (e. g., transportation to clinic appointments, household help), and emotional support. The programs may be delivered by multidisciplinary teams of health professionals, specially trained lay workers, or combination of lay and professional workers.ObjectivesThe primary objective was to assess effects of programs offering additional social support compared with routine care, for pregnant women believed at high risk for giving birth to babies that are either preterm or weigh less than 2500 gm, or both, at birth. Secondary objectives were to determine whether effectiveness of support was mediated by timing of onset (early versus later in pregnancy) or type of provider (healthcare professional or lay woman).Search strategyWe searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (January 2010).Selection criteriaRandomized trials of additional support during at-risk pregnancy by either a professional (social worker, midwife, or nurse) or specially trained lay person, compared to routine care. We defined additional support as some form of emotional support (e. g., counseling, reassurance, sympathetic listening) and information or advice or both, either in home visits or during clinic appointments, and could include tangible assistance (e. g., transportation to clinic appointments, assistance with care of other children at home).Data collection and analysisTwo review authors evaluated methodological quality. We performed double data entry.Main resultsWe included 17 trials (12,264 women). Programs offering additional social support for at-risk pregnant women were not associated with improvements in any perinatal outcomes, but there was a reduction in the likelihood of antenatal hospital admission (three trials; n = 737; RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.92) and caesarean birth (nine trials; n = 4522; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97).Author's conclusionsPregnant women need the support of caring family members, friends, and health professionals. While programs which offer additional support during pregnancy are unlikely to prevent the pregnancy from resulting in a low birthweight or preterm baby, they may be helpful in reducing the likelihood of antenatal hospital admission and caesarean birth.","Hodnett, Ellen D.; Fredericks, Suzanne; Weston, Julie",0,10.1002/14651858.CD000198.pub2,712
942,The efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy: A review of meta-analyses,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) refers to a popular therapeutic approach that has been applied to a variety of problems. The goal of this review was to provide a comprehensive survey of meta-analyses examining the efficacy of CBT. We identified 269 meta-analytic studies and reviewed of those a representative sample of 106 metaanalyses examining CBT for the following problems: substance use disorder, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, depression and dysthymia, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, eating disorders, insomnia, personality disorders, anger and aggression, criminal behaviors, general stress, distress due to general medical conditions, chronic pain and fatigue, distress related to pregnancy complications and female hormonal conditions. Additional meta-analytic reviews examined the efficacy of CBT for various problems in children and elderly adults. The strongest support exists for CBT of anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders, bulimia, anger control problems, and general stress. Eleven studies compared response rates between CBT and other treatments or control conditions. CBT showed higher response rates than the comparison conditions in seven of these reviews and only one review reported that CBT had lower response rates than comparison treatments. In general, the evidencebase of CBT is very strong. However, additional research is needed to examine the efficacy of CBT for randomizedcontrolled studies. Moreover, except for children and elderly populations, no meta-analytic studies of CBT have been reported on specific subgroups, such as ethnic minorities and low income samples.

943,Implementing a Universal Stress Management Program for Young School Children: Are there Classroom Climate or Academic Effects?,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible academic and classroom climate effects of the universal school program Zippy's Friends, the primary objective of which is to strengthen children's ability to cope with stress. The sample consisted of 1483 children (aged 7-8 years) from 91 second-grade classes in 35 schools. The schools were matched and randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions. Classroom social climate and academic skills were assessed by the teachers and the children using an adapted version of the German scale SIKS (Social Integration, Classroom Climate and Self-concept of School Readiness). Using a multilevel approach, regression analysis of teacher reports indicated that the program had a positive effect on the social climate in the classroom, reduced bullying and improved academic skills. Analysis of children's reports found no significant overall effects. The results were not influenced by students' sex or socioeconomic status.

944,"Smoking, depression, & stress: predictors of fibromyalgia health status","The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of smoking, stress, and depression on fibromyalgia health status. Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic musculoskeletal pain condition that negatively affects health status. Health status is not only affected by the constellation of physical symptoms, but also by mood symptoms, stress levels, and patient behaviors (e.g. smoking). Participants were 491 individuals with a physicianâ€™s diagnosis of FMS. They completed self-report measures of their current levels of depression, stress, the number of cigarettes smoked per day, and health status. A linear regression analysis was conducted to determine whether these measures predicted FMS health status. All three measures predicted worse health status, predicting 51.5% of the variance in health status. However, it is important to evaluate and treat more than just the physical symptoms of FMS. Attention should also be paid to mental health status and to engagement in unhealthy behaviors in order to reduce their effects on FMS health status. Future researchers should design and evaluate interventions that target these modifiable risk factors to determine the extent to which they could improve health outcomes.

945,Diagnosis and treatment of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM),"There is controversy regarding the incidence and significance of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM). Studies that utilize central acting stimulation tests, including corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), insulin stress testing (IST), d-fenfluramine, ipsapirone, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and metyrapone testing, have demonstrated that HPA axis dysfunction of central origin is present in a majority of these patients. However, ACTH stimulation tests and baseline cortisol testing lack the sensitivity to detect this central dysfunction and have resulted in controversy and confusion regarding the incidence of HPA axis dysfunction in these conditions and the appropriateness of treatment. While both CFS and FM patients are shown to have central HPA dysfunction, the dysfunction in CFS is at the pituitary-hypothalamic level while the dysfunction in FM is more related to dysfunction at the hypothalamic and supra-hypothalamic levels. Because treatment with low physiologic doses of cortisol (<15 mg) has been shown to be safe and effective and routine dynamic ACTH testing does not have adequate diagnostic sensitivity, it is reasonable to give a therapeutic trial of physiologic doses of cortisol to the majority of patients with CFS and FM, especially to those who have symptoms that are consistent with adrenal dysfunction, have low blood pressure or have baseline cortisol levels in the low or low-normal range.

946,Systematic Review on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Among Survivors of the Wenchuan Earthquake,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) widely occurs among victims or witness of disasters. With flashbacks, hyperarousal, and avoidance being the typical symptoms, PTSD became a focus of psychological research. The earthquake in Wenchuan, China, on May 12, 2008, was without precedent in magnitude and aftermath and caused huge damage, which drew scientistsâ€™ attention to mental health of the survivors. We conducted a systematic overview by collecting published articles from the PubMed database and classifying them into five points: epidemiology, neuropathology, biochemistry, genetics and epigenetics, and treatment. The large body of research during the past 6 years showed that adolescents and adults were among the most studied populations with high prevalence rates for PTSD. Genomic and transcriptomic studies focusing on gene Ã— environment studies as well as epigenetics are still rare, although a few available data showed great potential to better understand the pathophysiology of PTSD as multifactorial disease. Phytotherapy with Chinese herbs and acupuncture are rarely reported as of yet, although the first published data indicated promising therapy effects. Future studies should focus on the following points: (1) The affected populations under observation should be better defined concerning individual risk factor, time of observation, spatial movement, and individual disease courses of patients. (2) The role of social support for prevalence rates of PTSD should be observed in more detail. (3) Efficacy and safety of Chinese medicine should be studied to find potential interventions and effective treatments of PTSD.

947,Efficacy of a Spanish-Language Self-Administered Stress Management Training intervention for Latinas undergoing chemotherapy,"Background: Cancer patients often report increased stress during chemotherapy. Stress management training has been shown to reduce this adverse outcome, but few interventions exist for Spanish-speaking Hispanic and Latina women (Latinas). Methods: Following community feedback (including focus groups/in-depth interviews), we transcreated the Spanish-Language Self-Administered Stress Management Training (SL-SAT) intervention based on our previously developed and implemented English-based intervention. Latinas about to begin chemotherapy were randomized to SL-SAT (nÂ =Â 121) or usual care (nÂ =Â 119). A Spanish-speaking interventionist met with SL-SAT participants who received the SL-SAT toolkit containing instructions in 3 well-established stress management techniques (deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery, and use of coping self-statements). Usual care participants received an educational booklet about coping with chemotherapy. All patients were instructed by nurses on their chemotherapy medications and given a resource listing of local support groups. Outcomes were obtained at baseline, and 7 and 13Â weeks after starting chemotherapy. Primary outcomes included anxiety and depression, cancer-related distress, emotional well-being, and spiritual well-being. Secondary outcomes included functional well-being, social/family well-being, physical well-being, symptom severity, and self-efficacy for managing stress. Data were analyzed by using mixed models. Results: In both groups, improvements were observed in emotional well-being (PÂ =.01), and declines were observed in functional well-being (PÂ =.05), and physical well-being (PÂ <.0001). Symptom severity increased across the follow-up period (PÂ <.001). Conclusions: To be effective, stress management interventions for Latinas receiving chemotherapy may necessitate more attention from an interventionist, delivery of the intervention over a longer interval, and/or a group-based format.

950,"Psychological Distress, Emotional Stability, and Emotion Regulation Moderate Dynamics of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Recurrence","Background: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) genital lesion recurrence is modulated by psychological factors, but no such link with viral shedding (and thus asymptomatic transmission) has been observed in humans. Purpose: The moderating effects of average psychological distress, emotional stability, and emotion regulation on HSV-2 recurrence were tested. Methods: Nineteen HSV-2 seropositive women were followed over 22Â weeks. Daily measures of HSV-2 recurrence and psychological distress were collected. HSV-2 lesions and viral shedding were modeled as linear oscillator systems, with psychological distress moderating the periodicity of each process. Results: High levels of distress, more labile moods, and less ability to regulate emotional states were associated with fewer days elapsed between the onset of lesion episodes. Viral shedding showed the same pattern. Conclusions: Results are consistent with research indicating that psychological distress suppresses immune system functioning, and provide new evidence that genital HSV-2 viral shedding is related to, and regulated by, psychological distress.

The results indicated an interaction, with high-alexithymic participants in the full treatment group reporting increased levels of emotional distress several days after writing. The hypothesis that preceding journaling with a relaxation would be beneficial for non-alexithymic participants was not supported. These findings contribute to the ongoing examination of how best to optimise the effectiveness of journaling. They also lend support to the importance of including alexithymia as a moderator variable in future journaling research.","Horneffer K.J., Chan K.-M.",0,10.1080/02699930802009381,721
952,Biofeedback Training in Crisis Managers: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Working in crisis environments represents a major challenge, especially for executive personnel engaged in directing disaster operations, i.e. crisis managers. Crisis management involves operating under conditions of extreme stress resulting, for instance, from high-level decision-making, principal responsibility for personnel, multitasking or working under conditions of risk and time pressure. The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a newly developed biofeedback training procedure based on electrodermal activity, especially designed for the target group of crisis managers. The training comprised exercises promoting acquisition of control over sympathetic arousal under resting conditions and during exposure to visual, acoustic and cognitive stressors resembling situations related to crisis management. In a randomized controlled design, 36 crisis managers were assigned to either a biofeedback training group or waiting list control group. Subjective stress was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. In the training group, stress level markedly decreased; the decrease remained stable at follow-up 2 months after the training. The results indicate that biofeedback training in crisis management is an effective method for stress management that may help to reduce vulnerability to stress-related performance decline and stress-related disease.

Although numerous descriptive studies exist, there is little systematic evaluation of the work of community mental health nurses, and this problem is particularly acute in the field of preventative work. This paper presents the results of a small initiative to incorporate outcome evaluation into the clinical work of a community mental health team. Ninety-nine participants in a series of stress management workshops completed stress questionnaires before a series of 2-day workshops and were followed up at between 3 and 6 months afterwards. At follow-up, participants reported greater gains in terms of stress management than did no-treatment controls. The study offers tentative evidence for the effectiveness of community mental health nurses in offering effective preventative interventions and also indicates that such interventions are amenable to outcome evaluation within the context of routine clinical practice.","Hostick, T; Newell, R; Ward, T",0,,723
954,Cross-cultural training effectiveness: Does when the training is delivered matter?,"A longitudinal field quasi-experiment was conducted to examine the effect of timing of delivery on a cross-cultural training program. Participants were 61 new international graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) enrolled in one of the two mandatory English class sections. The two class sessions were randomly assigned to either an early training condition, in which GTAs received the training two weeks into the fall semester, or a delayed training condition, in which GTAs received the identical training two months into the fall semester. It was hypothesized that the Delayed Group should benefit more from the training than the Early Group. A process model was proposed that specified the temporal order of various training outcomes. Results showed that the delayed training group reported higher utility perceptions immediately after the training and had better cross-cultural adjustment two years later than the early training group. A path analysis largely supported the hypothesized process model, yielding several significant indirect effects among various training outcomes. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

955,Long-term outcome after acute lung injury,"Purpose of reviewAs incidence of acute lung injury (ALI) increases and case fatality decreases, long-term care of survivors is of public health importance. Previous studies demonstrate that these survivors are at risk for impairment in physical, cognitive and mental health. In this review, we will discuss recent studies that add to our knowledge of long-term outcomes after ALI and critical illness.Recent findingsNew studies show that persisting impairment in physical and cognitive function continues 5 years after recovery from critical illness. Glucose dysregulation may play a role in development of both depression and cognitive impairment. Premorbid impairment appears to be an important risk factor, but critical illness is an independent risk factor of physical and cognitive functional decline. Recent randomized controlled trials emphasize that post-ICU interventions may not be enough to improve health-related quality of life after ALI. Interventions delivered early in critical illness, such as physical and occupational therapy and creation of ICU diaries, may be key in improving late outcomes after ALI.SummaryPhysical, cognitive and mental health impairments after ALI are common, persistent and expensive. Future research is needed to improve prediction, prevention and treatment of these important sequelae.","Hough, Catherine L.; Herridge, Margaret S.",0,10.1097/MCC.0b013e32834f186d,725
959,The relative contribution of ankle moment and trailing limb angle to propulsive force during gait,"A major factor for increasing walking speed is the ability to increase propulsive force. Although propulsive force has been shown to be related to ankle moment and trailing limb angle, the relative contribution of each factor to propulsive force has never been determined. The primary purpose of this study was to quantify the relative contribution of ankle moment and trailing limb angle to propulsive force for able-bodied individuals walking at different speeds. Twenty able-bodied individuals walked at their self-selected and 120% of self-selected walking speed on the treadmill. Kinematic data were collected using an 8-camera motion-capture system. A model describing the relationship between ankle moment, trailing limb angle and propulsive force was obtained through quasi-static analysis. Our main findings were that ankle moment and trailing limb angle each contributes linearly to propulsive force, and that the change in trailing limb angle contributes almost as twice as much as the change in ankle moment to the increase in propulsive force during speed modulation for able-bodied individuals. Able-bodied individuals preferentially modulate trailing limb angle more than ankle moment to increase propulsive force. Future work will determine if this control strategy can be applied to individuals poststroke.

Furthermore, this study also examined the possible relationships between catecholamines (NE and EPI) and blood lymphocyte subsets following combined mental and physical challenge. Ten professional male firefighters participated in two counterbalanced exercise conditions on a cycle ergometer: (1) 37min of cycle ergometry at 60% VO2max (exercise alone condition; EAC) and (2) 37min of cycle ergometry at 60% VO2max along with 20min of a computerized firefighting strategies and tactics decision-making challenge (firefighting strategies condition; FSC). FSC elicited significantly greater HR, NE, and EPI when compared to EAC. Both EAC and FSC elicited increases in CD3- CD56+ NK cells. The percentages of CD3+ T cells, CD3+CD4+ helper T cells, CD4/CD8 ratio, CD19+ B cells, and total lymphocytes were lower immediately following both conditions. Following dual challenge NE AUC was negatively correlated with percentage of CD19+ B cells immediately post challenge, and HR was negatively associated with the percent change in the CD4/CD8 ratio from pre to post challenge. These elevations in NE and heart rate simultaneously in response to the dual challenge suggest greater sympathetic activation that in turn would possibly explain the alteration in the distribution of lymphocyte subsets.

962,Stress self-management: An intervention for women with physical disabilities,"Purpose: We sought to develop and evaluate the efficacy of an innovative, theory-driven, group stress self-management intervention designed to ameliorate stress and promote health among women with physical disabilities such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and arthritis. Methods: We recruited a voluntary sample of 78 community-living women with disabilities who were randomly assigned to either the group stress management intervention or the wait-listed control group, and we used a within- and between-groups pretest/posttest design with a 3-month follow-up. Results: Group differences in changes over time on measures of perceived stress and mental health offer support for the efficacy of the intervention. At the 3-month follow-up assessment, the intervention group also showed greater improvement on measures of pain and role limitations owing to physical health when compared the wait-listed control group. Perceived stress was supported as a mediator of the effect of the intervention on mental health. We found support for social connectedness and self-efficacy as mediators of the relation between the intervention and perceived stress; however, there was relatively weak evidence for differential change over time in those proposed mediators. Conclusion: This study provides the first of its kind, that is, an evaluation of the efficacy of a stress self-management intervention designed specifically for women with physical disabilities. The results are consistent with a model in which the stress management intervention enhances self-efficacy and social connectedness, which leads to reduced stress, which then contributes to improved mental health.

964,Impacts of the CARE for teachers program on teachers' social and emotional competence and classroom interactions,"Understanding teachers' stress is of critical importance to address the challenges in today's educational climate. Growing numbers of teachers are reporting high levels of occupational stress, and high levels of teacher turnover are having a negative impact on education quality. Cultivating Awareness and Resilience in Education (CARE for Teachers) is a mindfulness-based professional development program designed to promote teachers' social and emotional competence and improve the quality of classroom interactions. The efficacy of the program was assessed using a cluster randomized trial design involving 36 urban elementary schools and 224 teachers. The CARE for Teachers program involved 30 hr of in-person training in addition to intersession phone coaching. At both pre- and postintervention, teachers completed self-report measures and assessments of their participating students. Teachers' classrooms were observed and coded using the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS). Analyses showed that CARE for Teachers had statistically significant direct positive effects on adaptive emotion regulation, mindfulness, psychological distress, and time urgency. CARE for Teachers also had a statistically significant positive effect on the emotional support domain of the CLASS. The present findings indicate that CARE for Teachers is an effective professional development both for promoting teachers' social and emotional competence and increasing the quality of their classroom interactions.

965,Improving classroom learning environments by cultivating awareness and resilience in education (CARE): Results of a randomized controlled trial,"Cultivating Awareness and Resilience in Education (CARE for Teachers) is a mindfulness- based professional development program designed to reduce stress and improve teachers' performance and classroom learning environments. A randomized controlled trial examined program efficacy and acceptability among a sample of 50 teachers randomly assigned to CARE or waitlist control condition. Participants completed a battery of self-report measures at pre- and postintervention to assess the impact of the CARE program on general well-being, efficacy, burnout/time pressure, and mindfulness. Participants in the CARE group completed an evaluation of the program after completing the intervention. ANCOVAs were computed between the CARE group and control group for each outcome, and the pretest scores served as a covariate. Participation in the CARE program resulted in significant improvements in teacher wellbeing, efficacy, burnout/time-related stress, and mindfulness compared with controls. Evaluation data showed that teachers viewed CARE as a feasible, acceptable, and effective method for reducing stress and improving performance. Results suggest that the CARE program has promise to support teachers working in challenging settings and consequently improve classroom environments.

966,Adherence to Cancer Screening Guidelines and Predictors of Improvement Among Participants in the Kansas State Employee Wellness Program,"Introduction Employee wellness programs (EWPs) have been used to implement worksite-based cancer prevention and control interventions. However, little is known about whether these programs result in improved adherence to cancer screening guidelines or how participants' characteristics affect subsequent screening. This study was conducted to describe cancer screening behaviors among participants in a state EWP and identify factors associated with screening adherence among those who were initially nonadherent. Methods We identified employees and their dependents who completed health risk assessments (HRAs) as part of the Kansas state EWP in both 2008 and 2009. We examined baseline rates of adherence to cancer screening guidelines in 2008 and factors associated with adherence in 2009 among participants who were initially nonadherent. Results Of 53,095 eligible participants, 13,222 (25%) participated in the EWP in 2008 and 6,205 (12%) participated in both years. Among the multiyear participants, adherence was high at baseline to screening for breast (92.5%), cervical (91.8%), and colorectal cancer (72.7%). Of participants who were initially nonadherent in 2008, 52.4%, 41.3%, and 33.5%, respectively, became adherent in the following year to breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. Suburban/urban residence and more frequent doctor visits predicted adherence to breast and colorectal cancer screening guidelines. Conclusion The effectiveness of EWPs for increasing cancer screening is limited by low HRA participation rates, high rates of adherence to screening at baseline, and failure of nonadherent participants to get screening. Improving overall adherence to cancer screening guidelines among employees will require efforts to increase HRA participation, stronger interventions for nonadherent participants, and better access to screening for rural employees.","Hui, SKA; Engelman, KK; Shireman, TI; Ellerbeck, EF",0,10.5888/pcd10.120212,732
967,Novel Method for Recruiting Representative At-Risk Individuals into Cancer Prevention Trials: Online Health Risk Assessment in Employee Wellness Programs,"Participation in cancer prevention trials (CPT) is lower than 3 % among high-risk healthy individuals, and racial/ethnic minorities are the most under-represented. Novel recruitment strategies are therefore needed. Online health risk assessment (HRA) serves as a gateway component of nearly all employee wellness programs (EWPs) and may be a missed opportunity. This study aimed to explore employees' interest, willingness, motivators, and barriers of releasing their HRA responses to an external secure research database for recruitment purpose. We used qualitative research methods (focus group and individual interviews) to examine employees' interest and willingness in releasing their online HRA responses to an external, secure database to register as potential CPT participants. Fifteen structured interviews (40 % of study participants were of racial/ethnic minority) were conducted, and responses reached saturation after four interviews. All employees showed interest and willingness to release their online HRA responses to register as a potential CPT participant. Content analyses revealed that 91 % of participants were motivated to do so, and the major motivators were to (1) obtain help in finding personally relevant prevention trials, (2) help people they know who are affected by cancer, and/or (3) increase knowledge about CPT. A subset of participants (45 %) expressed barriers of releasing their HRA responses due to concerns about credibility and security of the external database. Online HRA may be a feasible but underutilized recruitment method for cancer prevention trials. EWP-sponsored HRA shows promise for the development of a large, centralized registry of racially/ethnically representative CPT potential participants.","Hui, SKA; Miller, SM; Hazuda, L; Engelman, K; Ellerbeck, EF",0,10.1007/s13187-015-0927-8,733
968,Organisational determinants of the use of physical restraints: A multilevel approach,"This paper reports a study of the relationship between the use of physical restraints with psycho-geriatric nursing home residents and the characteristics of organisations and residents. It is hypothesised that impairment in residents and organisational characteristics, such as a high workload of nursing staff and a low full-time equivalent (FTE) ratio on the wards, are associated with increased restraint use. In a cross-sectional study involving 15 Dutch psycho-geriatric nursing home wards, 432 residents were selected for participation, of which 371 actually participated. Restraint status was measured using observations. Other resident characteristics, such as cognitive status, were determined using the Minimum Data Set (MDS). Job characteristics, such as workload, were determined by different self-reported measures. Characteristics of the wards, such as the FTE ratio, were derived from the registration system of the wards. Physical restraints were used with 56% of the psycho-geriatric nursing home residents. Bivariate analysis showed that job and ward characteristics were not associated with restraint use. Bivariate and multilevel analysis showed that residents' characteristics, such as mobility and cognitive status were significantly associated with restraint use. Furthermore, multilevel analysis showed that higher job autonomy experienced by nursing staff and a higher FTE ratio on the wards were also associated with increased restraint use. In conclusion, job and ward characteristics were not as strongly associated as residents' characteristics with restraint use. Impairments in residents, such as immobility, were strongly related to the use of restraints. Therefore, education and support of nursing staff in caring for psycho-geriatric nursing home residents with poor mobility is recommended to reduce the use of physical restraints in nursing homes.

969,Peer Support Program for Chinese Low Income Mothers: An Evaluation Study and Implications for Practice,"This study evaluated a peer-support program for low-income mothers that is designed to serve the objectives of (1) enhancing the parentsâ€™ competence, (2) reducing their stress and tension, and (3) building social support networks for parents. This program involves a service delivery model that is characterized by community-based, social worker- and parent-mentor-led support groups, with informal group support at a later stage. We evaluated whether the program was effective for enhancing the social support, psychological well-being and parenting competence of the users. We also identified the most crucial elements of peer-support services for disadvantaged mothers. In conducting this study, we applied a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods in three phases. For the quantitative study, two groups (service user and control) were examined three times over a 6-month period. For the qualitative study, we constructed a purposeful sample by drawing mothers from the pool of parents who had participated in the program, and conducted focus-group interviews with these mothers at three points, parallel to the quantitative study. The results suggested that the community-based peer-support group program is effective. There is, however, a need to strengthen the models of peer support by better defining the respective roles of the parent participants, the peer counselors and the social workers. More fundamentally, there is a need to clarify the basic philosophy of the program along the continuum of professional/expert-vs. indigenous/peer-led participants. The program also needs to better capture the strengths of peers and mentors in its peer-support group model.

970,TRiM: an organizational response to traumatic events in Cumbria Constabulary,"A major incident involving multiple fatalities occurred in Cumbria, England on 2 June 2010. The Cumbrian Constabulary deployed an organizational peer support response for personnel involved known as trauma risk management (TRiM).To examine data routinely gathered during the TRiM process to evaluate the relationship of the intervention to sickness absence.Using incident databases, details were gathered regarding exposure to the murders and type of TRiM intervention, including an assessment of the psychological risk to the individual of developing a trauma-related mental health problem. Sociodemographic information was collated by the occupational health department. Cumulative sickness absence data in the 2 months following the murders were used as a proxy for mental health status.A total of 717 police officers and civilian support staff were identified. High levels of traumatic exposure were associated with subsequent receipt of a TRiM intervention. The majority of psychological risk indices reduced between the initial and subsequent evaluation. Greater traumatic exposure was associated with longer sickness absence lengths. Engagement in the TRiM process was associated with a reduction in sickness absence especially in more junior ranks.In this study, we found that TRiM deployed within a police force responding to a major event offered a way of structuring a response for those involved. Our data suggest that TRiM may offer a way of assessing psychological risk so that officers can be offered early supportive interventions. Our data suggest that TRiM may help to ameliorate some of the negative effects of high trauma exposure.","Hunt, E.; Jones, N.; Hastings, V.; Greenberg, N.",0,10.1093/occmed/kqt113,736
972,Effects of occupational therapy on quality of life of patients with metastatic prostate cancer A randomized controlled study,"Objectives: To evaluate the efficiency of occupational therapy relative to a home program in improving quality of life (QoL) among men who were treated for metastatic prostate cancer (MPC).Methods: Fifty-five men were assigned randomly to either the 12-week cognitive behavioral therapy based occupational therapy (OT-CBSM) intervention (treatment group) or a home program (control group) between March 2012 and August 2014 in the Department of Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) was used to measure the occupational performance and identify difficulties in daily living activities. The QoL and symptom status were measured by The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 and its Prostate Cancer Module. A 12-week OT-CBSM intervention including client-centered training of daily living activities, recreational group activities, and cognitive behavioral stress management intervention were applied.Results: The COPM performance and satisfaction scores, which indicate occupational participation and QoL increased statistically in the treatment group in relation to men who were included in the home-program (p <= 0.05).Conclusion: A 12-week OT-CBSM intervention was effective in improving QoL in men treated for MPC, and these changes were associated significantly with occupational performance.","Huri, Meral; Huri, Emre; Kayihan, Hulya; Altuntas, Onur",0,10.15537/smj.2015.8.11461,737
974,Heat Stress Management Program Improving Worker Health and Operational Effectiveness A Case Study,"Heat stress monitoring is a vital component of an effective health and safety program when employees work in exceptionally warm environments. Workers at hazardous waste sites often wear personal protective equipment (PPE), which increases the body heat stress load. No specific Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations address heat stress; however, OSHA does provide several guidance documents to assist employers in addressing this serious workplace health hazard. This article describes a heat stress and surveillance plan implemented at a hazardous waste site as part of the overall health and safety program. The PPE requirement for work at this site, coupled with extreme environmental temperatures, made heat stress a significant concern. Occupational health nurses and industrial hygienists developed a monitoring program for heat stress designed to prevent the occurrence of significant heat-related illness in site workers. The program included worker education on the signs of heat-related illness and continuous physiologic monitoring to detect early signs of heat-related health problems. Biological monitoring data were collected before workers entered the exclusion zone and on exiting the zone following decontamination. Sixty-six site workers were monitored throughout site remediation. More than 1,700 biological monitoring data points were recorded. Outcomes included improved worker health and safety, and increased operational effectiveness.","Huss, RG; Skelton, SB; Alvis, KL; Shane, LA",0,10.3928/21650799-20130218-38,738
975,"Experiences of employees with arm, neck or shoulder complaints: a focus group study","Background: Many people suffer from complaints of the arm, neck or shoulder (CANS). CANS causes significant work problems, including absenteeism (sickness absence), presenteeism (decreased work productivity) and, ultimately, job loss. There is a need for intervention programs for people suffering from CANS. Management of symptoms and workload, and improving the workstyle, could be important factors in the strategy to deal with CANS. The objective of this study is to evaluate the experienced problems of employees with CANS, as a first step in an intervention mapping process aimed at adaptation of an existing self-management program to the characteristics of employees suffering from CANS.Methods: A qualitative study comprising three focus group meetings with 15 employees suffering from CANS. Based on a question guide, participants were asked about experiences in relation to continuing work despite their complaints. Data were analysed using content analysis with an open-coding system. During selective coding, general themes and patterns were identified and relationships between the codes were examined.Results: Participants suffering from CANS often have to deal with pain, disability, fatigue, misunderstanding and stress at work. Some needs of the participants were identified, i.e. disease-specific information, exercises, muscle relaxation, working with pain, influence of the work and/or social environment, and personal factors (including workstyle).Conclusions: Employees suffering from CANS search for ways to deal with their complaints in daily life and at work. This study reveals several recurring problems and the results endorse the multi-factorial origin of CANS. Participants generally experience problems similar to those of employees with other types of complaints or chronic diseases, e.g. related to their illness, insufficient communication, working together with healthcare professionals, colleagues and management, and workplace adaptations. These topics will be addressed in the adaptation of an existing self-management program to the characteristics of employees suffering from CANS.","Hutting, Nathan; Heerkens, Yvonne F.; Engels, Josephine A.; Staal, J.

976,Examining the Protective Effects of Mindfulness Training on Working Memory Capacity and Affective Experience,"We investigated the impact of mindfulness training (MT) on working memory capacity (WMC) and affective experience. WMC is used in managing cognitive demands and regulating emotions. Yet, persistent and intensive demands, such as those experienced during high-stress intervals, may deplete WMC and lead to cognitive failures and emotional disturbances. We hypothesized that MT may mitigate these deleterious effects by bolstering WMC. We recruited 2 military cohorts during the high-stress predeployment interval and provided MT to 1 (MT, n = 31) but not the other group (military control group, MC, n = 17). The MT group attended an 8-week MT course and logged the amount of out-of-class time spent practicing formal MT exercises. The operation span task was used to index WMC at 2 testing sessions before and after the MT course. Although WMC remained stable over time in civilians (n = 12), it degraded in the MC group. In the MT group, WMC decreased over time in those with low MT practice time, but increased in those with high practice time. Higher MT practice time also corresponded to lower levels of negative affect and higher levels of positive affect (indexed by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule). The relationship between practice time and negative, but not positive, affect was mediated by WMC, indicating that MT-related improvements in WMC may support some but not all of MT's salutary effects. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that sufficient MT practice may protect against functional impairments associated with high-stress contexts.

Method: 2878 professionals for physical examination were selected and randomly divided into treatment group and control group, with 1443 professionals and 1435 professionals, respectively. Then, the difference of mental health status before and after mental intervention between two groups was compared. Results: In treatment group, the proportion of people with healthy mental and modest pressure after mental intervention was higher than that before mental intervention and that in control group after mental intervention (P<0.01); the proportion of people with psychological sub-heath and moderate pressure after mental intervention was significantly lower than that before mental intervention and that in control group after mental intervention (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in mental health status in control group before and after mental intervention (P>0.05). Mental health consciousness, health status, self pressure-relief capability, job satisfaction, and happiness index of professionals were up to 63.3%similar to 78.8%. Conclusions: Mental health promotion and mental intervention may significantly improve mental health status of professionals.","Jiang, Shu-Qiang; Zhang, Jian-Ling",1,,741
979,Psychological and physiological response of students to different types of stress management programs,"Purpose. To design, implement, and examine the psychoneuroendocrine responses of three different types of stress management programs. Design. Randomly assigned. A pre/post experimental design comparing variables between three different programs and a control group. The first program included training in deep breathing, relaxation response, meditation, and guided imagery techniques (RRGI). The second program included training in cognitive behavioral techniques (CB). The third program included both RRGI and CB (RRGICB). Setting. The study was conducted at Buenos Aires University. Subjects. Participants (N 552) were undergraduate students. Measures. Anxiety, anger, hopelessness, neuroticism, respiration rate, and salivary cortisol levels were assessed. Analysis. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to investigate differences in pre and post variables. Results. Subjects in the RRGI group showed significantly lower levels of anxiety (p < .011), anger (p < .012), neuroticism (p < .01), respiratory rate (p < .002), hopelessness (p < .01), and salivary cortisol (p < .002) after the treatment. Subjects in the CB group showed significantly lower levels of anxiety (p < .018), anger (p < .037), and neuroticism (p < .03) after the treatment. Subjects in the RRGICB group showed significantly lower levels of anxiety (p < .001), anger (p < .001), neuroticism (p < .008), hopelessness (p < .01), respiratory rate (p < .001), and salivary cortisol (p < .002) after the treatment. Subjects in the control group showed only one variable modification, a significant increase in cortisol levels (p < .004). Conclusions. The combination of deep breathing, relaxation response, meditation, and guided imagery techniques with CB seems to be effective at helping people to deal with stress.

980,Effectiveness of a stress management program to enhance perimenopausal women's ability to cope with stress,"Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of a stress management program to enhance the ability to cope with stress in perimenopausal women. Methods: In this quasi-experimental design, a stress management program was provided to an experimental group (n=55), while a control group (n=42) was given an informational pamphlet. The stress management program included a short lecture, group discussion, and hands-on training in 2h sessions once a week for 3weeks. Participants were recruited through a public announcement. Data were collected before and after the intervention, and 1month following the intervention. The ability to cope with stress was the primary outcome, while psychological well-being and relief of symptoms were the secondary outcomes. The primary purpose of this program is to enhance the ability to cope with stress. Therefore, the aspects of knowledge, coping flexibility, and manageability were measured in the resultant ability to cope with stress. Results: Compared to the control group, knowledge in the experimental group improved positively as the primary outcome (P<0.01). Changes in coping flexibility were demonstrated within the experimental group (P<0.05). A comparison between groups for the secondary outcome of psychological well-being showed that personal growth (P<0.05) and happiness (P<0.01) significantly improved in the experimental group. In addition, the secondary outcome of relief of symptoms indicated not improved. Conclusion: Results suggest that the stress management program has the potential to boost perimenopausal women's ability to cope with stress and improve their psychological well-being.

982,Access to Employee Wellness Programs and Use of Preventive Care Services Among US Adults,"Introduction: There is little research at the national level on access to employee wellness programs and the use of preventive care services. This study examined the use of seven preventive care services among U. S working adults with access to employee wellness programs. Methods: The study population comprised 17,699 working adults aged = 18 years, obtained from the 2015 National Health Interview Survey. Multivariate logistic regression models examined the relationship between access to employee wellness programs and use of seven preventive care services: influenza vaccination, blood pressure check, diabetes check, cholesterol check, Pap smear test, mammogram, and colon cancer screening. Data analysis began in Fall 2016. Results: Overall, 46.6% of working adults reported having access to employee wellness programs in 2015. Working adults with access to employee wellness programs had higher odds of receiving influenza vaccination (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.43, 1.72, po0.001), blood pressure check (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 2.17, 2.78, po0.001), diabetes check (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.12, 1.50, po0.001), cholesterol check (OR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.33, 1.67, po0.001), and mammogram (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.24, 1.98, po0.001). However, there was no significant difference between access to employee wellness programs and the use of Pap smear test and colon cancer screening services. Conclusions: Using a nationally representative sample of individuals, this study found a positive association between access to employee wellness programs and the use of preventive care services. The results support favorable policies to encourage implementing wellness programs in all worksites, especially those with <50 employees. (C) 2017 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

984,"A Randomized-Controlled, Pilot Intervention on Diabetes Prevention and Healthy Lifestyles in the New York City Korean Community","Asian Americans experience diabetes at a higher rate than non-Hispanic whites. Diabetes prevention programs using lifestyle interventions have been shown to produce beneficial results, yet there have been no culturally-tailored programs for diabetes prevention in the Korean community. We explore the impact and feasibility of a pilot Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention to improve health behaviors and promote diabetes prevention among Korean Americans using a randomized controlled trial. Between 2011 and 2012, a total of 48 Korean Americans at risk for diabetes living in New York City (NYC) participated in the intervention. Participants were allocated to treatment or control groups. A community-based participatory research approach guided development of the intervention, which consisted of 6 workshops held by CHWs on diabetes prevention, nutrition, physical activity, diabetes complications, stress and family support, and access to health care. Changes over 6 months were examined for clinical measurements (weight, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol); health behaviors (physical activity, nutrition, food behaviors, diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy, and mental health); and health access (insurance and self-reported health). In this small pilot study, changes were seen in weight, waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure, physical activity nutrition, diabetes knowledge, and mental health. Qualitative findings provide additional contextual information that inform ways in which CHWs may influence health outcomes. These findings demonstrate that a diabetes prevention program can be successful among a Korean American population in NYC, and important insight is provided for ways that programs can be tailored to meet the needs of vulnerable populations.","Islam, Nadia S.; Zanowiak, Jennifer M.; Wyatt, Laura C.; Chun, Kay; Lee, Linda; Kwon, Simona C.; Trinh-Shevrin, Chau",0,10.1007/s10900-013-9711-z,745
985,Gulf War Illness: Lessons from medically unexplained symptoms,"Service in the Persian Gulf in 1991 is associated with increased reporting of symptoms and distress in a proportion of those who served there. Yet despite clear evidence of an increase in symptom burden and a decrease in well being, exhaustive clinical and laboratory based scientific research has failed to document many reproducible biomedical abnormalities in this group. Likewise, there has been no evidence of an increase in disease related mortality. Formal psychiatric disorders are twice as common in Gulf War veterans, as might be expected in the aftermath of any conflict, but this too is insufficient to explain the ill-health observed. Many service personnel who returned unwell believe that they have Gulf War Syndrome, and that their ill-health is due to exposures that they encountered in theatre. Research on multiple exposures to date has not generated a plausible aetiological mechanism for veterans' ill-health. Even if medical research has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation, it remains the case that many of those affected continue to be unwell and disabled some 15Â years after returning from combat. For this reason, it is time that more attention is given to developing effective interventions to relieve their ill-health and distress. In this review we discuss the importance of the wider social context, individual illness beliefs and attributions and go on to outline a model of continuing ill-health in Gulf veterans. The review concludes with some suggestions for future research priorities, in particular the need for further qualitative studies to further our understanding of the illness, in order that better treatments may be developed.

987,Efficacy of an internet-based intervention for burnout: a randomized controlled trial in the German working population,"Background and Objectives: Internet-based interventions are a viable treatment option for various mental problems. However, their effects on the burnout syndrome yielded mixed results. In this paper, we examine the efficacy of a structured and therapist-guided internet intervention, based on solution-focused and cognitive-behavioral therapy, for individuals with symptoms of burnout. Design: Two-arm, Internet-based, randomized, wait-list controlled trial (RCT). Methods: Participants were recruited through in-house events and online advertising. They were randomly assigned to the intervention or a wait-list. Group comparison was conducted three months after randomization. Outcomes were the burnout level according to the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-GS) and the levels of depression, anxiety and stress according to the DASS-21. Results: Thirty-nine participants were included in the trial; 36 (92.3%) took part at the 3-months-follow-up. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed significant group differences in favor of the intervention group in depression (d = 0.66), cynicism (d = 0.87) and personal accomplishment (d = 0.75). Conclusions: The intervention helped ameliorate symptoms of work-related stress and burnout. Although limited by a small sample size, the study suggests that the program provides effective support for affected individuals. However, further studies with bigger sample sizes should be conducted to examine the effects of such programs more precisely.

988,Cardiorespiratory fitness and laboratory stress: A meta-regression analysis,"We performed a meta-regression analysis of 73 studies that examined whether cardiorespiratory fitness mitigates cardiovascular responses during and after acute laboratory stress in humans. The cumulative evidence indicates that fitness is related to slightly greater reactivity, but better recovery. However, effects varied according to several study features and were smallest in the better controlled studies. Fitness did not mitigate integrated stress responses such as heart rate and blood pressure, which were the focus of most of the studies we reviewed. Nonetheless, potentially important areas, particularly hemodynamic and vascular responses, have been understudied. Women, racial/ethnic groups, and cardiovascular patients were underrepresented. Randomized controlled trials, including naturalistic studies of real-life responses, are needed to clarify whether a change in fitness alters putative stress mechanisms linked with cardiovascular health.

989,Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) After Critical Illness: A Conceptual Review of Distinct Clinical Issues and Their Implications,"Purpose/Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that develops after critical care may be marked by a unique constellation of symptoms that differ, for example, from the symptoms that develop in response to more traditional traumas such as combat or assault. Research Method/Design: We describe ways in which symptoms of PTSD after critical illness can be clinically engaged, drawing from literature pointing to ""best treatment"" practices in other settings. And, we discuss the relevance of intensive care unit (ICU) related PTSD to rehabilitation psychologists and explain why rehabilitation psychologists are well suited to identify and treat ICU-related PTSD. Results: In this conceptual review, drawing from both empirical findings and theoretical models, we surmise that traumatized survivors of critical illness demonstrate 2 central clinical features-avoidance and reexperiencing. Conclusions/Implications: The potentially unique clinical profile of ICU-related PTSD likely requires unique assessment and treatment practices. These services may be best provided by providers with expertise in providing coordinated care, such as rehabilitation psychologists. Next steps should include empirical study to determine whether practices that are empirically supported in other settings may be translated to the ICU and post-ICU hospitalization for critical illness survivors.

990,Evaluation of a multicomponent appearance-based sun-protective intervention for young women: Uncovering the mechanisms of program efficacy,"An appearance-based sun-protection intervention program was developed, implemented, and evaluated in a sample of 211 Caucasian women (ages 18-25) randomly assigned to the sun-protection program or to a stress management (control) program. The sun-protection program incorporated a novel construct of image norms of aspirational peers (i.e., female media figures, fashion models) approving paleness. The authors targeted these image norms as well as the advantages of tanning, health beliefs about photoaging and skin cancer, and self-efficacy for sun protection. The intervention produced significant differences across conditions favoring sun protection on all constructs but severity of skin cancer and barriers to sun protection. At follow-up, treatment participants exceeded controls both in intention to sun protect and sun-protective behavior and reported lower intention to sunbathe and fewer hours of sunbathing. A mediational model of intervention outcomes revealed distinct mediators for sun protection versus sunbathing.

991,Confronting challenges in intervention research with ethnically diverse older adults: the USC Well Elderly II Trial,"Background Community-dwelling older adults are at risk for declines in physical health, cognition, and psychosocial well-being. However, their enactment of active and health-promoting lifestyles can reduce such declines.Purpose The purpose of this article is to describe the USC Well Elderly 11 study, a randomized clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle program for elders, and document how various methodological challenges were addressed during the course of the trial.Methods In the study, 460 ethnically diverse elders recruited from a variety of sites in the urban Los Angeles area were enrolled in a randomized experiment involving a crossover design component. Within either the first or second 6-month phase of their study involvement, each elder received a lifestyle intervention designed to improve a variety of aging outcomes. At 4-5 time points over an 18-24 month interval, the research participants were assessed on measures of healthy activity, coping, social support, perceived control, stress-related biomarkers, perceived physical health, psychosocial well-being, and cognitive functioning to test the effectiveness of the intervention and document the process mechanisms responsible for its effects.Results The study protocol was successfully implemented, including the enrollment of study sites, the recruitment of 460 older adults, administration of the intervention, adherence to the plan for assessment, and establishment of a large computerized data base.Limitations: Methodological challenges were encountered in the areas of site recruitment, participant recruitment, testing, and intervention delivery.Conclusions The completion of clinical trials involving elders from numerous local sites requires careful oversight and anticipation of threats to the study design that stem from: (a) social situations that are particular to specific study sites; and (b) physical, functional, and social challenges pertaining to the elder population.

992,Burnout: Evaluation of the efficacy and tolerability of TARGET 1 (R) for professional fatigue syndrome (burnout),"Objective To study the effect of a dietary supplement (TARGET 1 (R): a combination of casozepine, taurine, Eleutherococcus senticosus and extramel) on burnout symptomatology.Methods A 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in workers engaged in professional contact with patients, students or clients. All were affected by burnout syndrome based on a score of 4 on the Burnout Measure Scale (BMS-10). The primary outcome measure was the change in the BMS-10 score; secondary outcome measures included the change in the Maslach's Burnout Inventory scale-Human Service Survey (MBI-HSS) score and the Beck Depression Inventory. Five scores were evaluated.Results Eighty-seven participants were enrolled in the study: 44 received the active formulation (verum group); 43 received placebo. After 12 weeks' supplementation, the placebo group showed significant improvements in scores for BMS-10, MBI-HSS fatigue and the Beck Depression Inventory, but MBI-HSS depersonalization and task management were not improved; the verum group showed significant improvements in all five scores. The verum group consistently showed significantly greater improvements in scores than the placebo group.Conclusions TARGET 1 (R) significantly improved the symptoms of burnout after 12 weeks' use.","Jacquet, Alain; Grolleau, Adeline; Jove, Jeremy; Lassalle, Regis; Moore, Nicholas",0,10.1177/0300060514558324,752
993,Lumbar-Load Analysis of Manual Patient-Handling Activities for Biomechanical Overload Prevention Among Healthcare Workers,"Manual patient handling commonly induces high mechanical load on the lower back of healthcare workers. A long-term research project, the Third Dortmund Lumbar Load Study' (DOLLY 3), was conducted to investigate the lumbar load of caregivers during handling activities that are considered definitely endangering in the context of workers compensation procedures. Nine types of handling activities in or at a bed or chair were analysed. Measurement of action forces via specifically developed devices and posture recording by means of optoelectronic marker capturing and video recordings in order to quantify several lumbar-load indicators was previously described in detail. This paper provides the results of laboratory examinations and subsequent biomechanical model calculations focused on lumbar load and the potentials of load reduction by applying biomechanically optimized transfer modes instead of a conventional technique and, for a subgroup of tasks, the supplementary usage of small aids such as a sliding mat or a glide board. Lumbosacral-disc compressive force may vary considerably with respect to the performed task, the mode of execution, and individual performance. For any activity type, highest values were found for conventional performance, lower ones for the improved transfer mode, and the lowest compressive-force values were gathered when small aids were applied. Statistical significance was verified for 13 of these 17 comparisons. Analysing indicators for asymmetric loading shows that lateral-bending and torsional moments of force at the lumbosacral disc may reach high values, which can be reduced considerably by implementing an improved handling mode. When evaluating biomechanical loads with respect to age- and gender-specific work-design limits, none of the analysed tasks, despite execution mode, resulted in an acceptable load range. Therefore, applying a biomechanically adequate handling mode combined with small aids to lower the friction between patient and surfaces is highly recommended, especially to prevent overload in older caregivers.","Jaeger, Matthias; Jordan, Claus; Theilmeier, Andreas; Wortmann, Norbert; Kuhn, Stefan; Nienhaus, Albert; Luttmann, Alwin",0,10.1093/annhyg/mes088,753
994,High Levels of Concomitant Behavioral Health Disorders Among Patients Presenting for HIV Non-occupational Post-exposure Prophylaxis at a Boston Community Health Center Between 1997 and 2013,"A paucity of information regarding mental health exists for patients presenting for HIV non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP). We reviewed electronic medical records of 894 adult nPEP patients seen at a large Boston community health center between 1997 and 2013. Of 821 patients with consensual sexual exposures, 88.3Â % were men who have sex with men, and 40.0Â % had a mental health diagnosis. Diagnoses included: depression (24.4Â %), anxiety (21.9Â %), attention deficit disorder (7.8Â %), post-traumatic stress disorder (3.3Â %), and psychotic disorders (3.3Â %). Of 129 patients with substance use disorders, alcohol dependence (65.9Â %) and crystal methamphetamine (43.4Â %) predominated. Unprotected receptive anal intercourse was associated with psychotic disorders (aORÂ =Â 4.86; 95Â %CI:1.76â€“13.5) and substance use disorders (aORÂ =Â 1.89; 95Â %CI:1.28â€“2.80). Substance use at the time of exposure was associated with: depression (aORÂ =Â 1.95; 95Â %CI:1.36â€“2.80), anxiety (aORÂ =Â 2.22; 95Â %CI:1.51â€“3.25), attention deficit disorder (aORÂ =Â 1.96; 95Â %CI:1.18â€“3.27), and substance use disorder (aORÂ =Â 4.78; 95Â %CI:3.30â€“6.93).

Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is empirically supported for the treatment of PTSD, but it is not specifically designed to accommodate the memory, attention, or problem solving deficits that are experienced by many Veterans with comorbid PTSD and TBI. Compensatory cognitive rehabilitation, including cognitive symptom management and rehabilitation therapy (CogSMART), is effective for cognitive deficits stemming from a variety of etiologies, including TBI. We have integrated components of CogSMART into CPT in order to address the unique challenges faced by Veterans with ongoing cognitive complaints related to PTSD and a history of mild TBI. Here we describe an ongoing randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of our novel hybrid treatment, SMART-CPT, as compared to standard CPT, for OIF/OEF/OND Veterans with PTSD and a history of mild to moderate TBI.

997,Development of sense of coherence during two group interventions,"Burnout is a serious occupational hazard. This study investigated the possibility to develop an effective salutogenic group intervention among employees suffering from severe burnout symptoms. Participants consisted of employees aged 31 to 59years working in different public service occupations, such as police officers, tax officers, (and other public service officers), and assigned to three different groups: analytic (N=25), psychodramatic (N=24) and controls (N=28). The intervention comprised 16 separate days over a nine-month period. Changes in sense of coherence (SOC) were measured four times with the 13-item Orientation to Life Questionnaire during the intervention and at six-month follow-up, and analyzed by general linear model (GLM) and using Cohen's d to estimate effect sizes. Change in SOC between the three groups was statistically significant (F(4,148) = 2.65, p=0.036). The psychodrama group showed a higher increase in SOC than the analytic group during the intervention, while the improvement in the analytic group was significant during the six-month follow-up. Total effect size from baseline to follow-up was in the analytic group 0.71, in the psychodrama group 0.47, and in the control group from baseline to end of intervention 0.09. The results show that it is possible to improve SOC by group intervention in the occupational healthcare context. The dialogue-based analytic method and action-based psychodramatic method differ in their specific effects.

999,Stress in crisis managers: evidence from self-report and psychophysiological assessments,"Directing disaster operations represents a major professional challenge. Despite its importance to health and professional performance, research on stress in crisis management remains scarce. The present study aimed to investigate self-reported stress and psychophysiological stress responses in crisis managers. For this purpose, 30 crisis managers were compared with 30 managers from other disciplines, in terms of self-reported stress, health status and psychophysiological reactivity to crisis-related and non-specific visual and acoustic aversive stimuli and cognitive challenge. Crisis managers reported lower stress levels, a more positive strain-recuperation-balance, greater social resources, reduced physical symptoms, as well as more physical exercise and less alcohol consumption. They exhibited diminished electrodermal and heart rate responses to crisis-related and non-specific stressors. The results indicate reduced stress and physical complaints, diminished psychophysiological stress reactivity, and a healthier life-style in crisis managers. Improved stress resistance may limit vulnerability to stress-related performance decline and facilitate preparedness for major incidents.

1000,The EMDR Integrative Group Treatment Protocol for patients with cancer,"Experiencing cancer is a peculiar stressor within the infrastructure of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) because this debilitating disease involves ongoing stressors and is both acute and potentially chronic. The experience can include a wide range of associated adverse events, such as tumor detection, diagnosis, severity of disease, and prognosis; aggressive treatment; disfigurement and bodily dysfunction; side effects of treatment; impaired physical, social, and occupational functioning; and sometimes, recurrence and diagnosis of terminal illness. This article provides a detailed description of the clinical application of the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) Integrative Group Treatment Protocol (EMDR-IGTP) Adapted for Adolescents and Adults Living with Ongoing Traumatic Stress for the patients with cancer. This protocol administers the eight phases of EMDR individual treatment to a group of patients using an art therapy format (i.e., drawings) and the butterfly hug (a self-administered bilateral stimulation method to process traumatic material). A previous study (Jarero et al., 2015) showed that after 6 sessions of EMDR-IGTP, there was a significant decrease in PTSD symptoms related to the diagnosis and treatment of different types of cancer in adult women. Effects were maintained at 90-day follow-up. In this article, we discuss how this protocol can be used to effectively provide intensive EMDR treatment to large groups of patients, and we provide detailed instructions for its provision to address one of the major psychological dimensions of cancer: the ongoing traumatic stress responses experienced by patients with cancer. A clinical example illustrates the treatment process. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2016 EMDR International Association.","Jarero I., Artigas L., Uribe S., GarcÃ¯Â¿Â½a L.E.",0,10.1891/1933-3196.10.3.199,759
1002,Effects of prone and supine positions on sleep state and stress responses in preterm infants,"Aim: The purpose of the study is to assess the influence of prone or supine position on sleep states and on withdrawal and approach reactions of preterm infants. Methods: Thirty-two preterm infants from Meir Medical Center, Israel, mean post menstrual age 30.37. Â± 2.57, mean birth weight 1250. g. Â± 313.86, participated in the study. Infants were studied during 48. h. Positions (prone and supine) were alternated every 3-4. h after feedings. Sleep states were assessed by Actigraph measurement and by two daily 30-min Naturalistic Observations of Newborn Behavior (NONB) to confirm sleep states and for recording the behavioral reactions (approach and withdrawal). Results: In the prone position there were more approach reactions as compared to withdrawal reactions (p< .001) while in the supine position, the approach and withdrawal reactions were comparable. In the prone position more sleep patterns (deep sleep, light sleep, drowsy) were observed as opposed to more awake patterns (quiet awake, active awake and agitated fussy) that were seen in the supine position. Conclusions: Clinical implications encourage placing the preterm infant in the prone position while in the NICU. This enables important achievements such as longer periods of quality sleep, and production of adaptive self-regulatory reactions.

1003,Non-pharmacologic interventions for CFS: A randomized trial,"Non-pharmacological behavioral treatments for CFS have been suggested as promising. These trials have tested protocols composed of behavioral, cognitive and cognitive-behavioral interventions but there have been few efforts to differentially evaluate their outcomes. The primary purpose of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of nurse delivered non-pharmacologic interventions. In the present study, 114 participants diagnosed with CFS were randomly assigned to four 6-month interventions. The interventions were: cognitive-behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, anaerobic activity, and a relaxation control group. The study found that these interventions led to increases in several areas of functioning, with more consistent changes occurring among those participants in the cognitive condition. For the 25 variables in this study, significant change occurred for 28%, 20%, 16%, and 12% of the variables for the cognitive, cognitive behavior therapy, anaerobic activity, and relaxation conditions, respectively. However, the majority of participants continued to be diagnosed with CFS following the treatment trial. Implications of these findings are discussed.

1004,Research on translations of tests: General inattentiveness is a long-term reliable trait independently predictive of psychological health: Danish validation studies of the mindful attention awareness scale,"The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) measures perceived degree of inattentiveness in different contexts and is often used as a reversed indicator of mindfulness. MAAS is hypothesized to reflect a psychological trait or disposition when used outside attentional training contexts, but the long-term test-retest reliability of MAAS scores is virtually untested. It is unknown whether MAAS predicts psychological health after controlling for standardized socioeconomic status classifications. First, MAAS translated to Danish was validated psychometrically within a randomly invited healthy adult community sample (N = 490). Factor analysis confirmed that MAAS scores quantified a unifactorial construct of excellent composite reliability and consistent convergent validity. Structural equation modeling revealed that MAAS scores contributed independently to predicting psychological distress and mental health, after controlling for age, gender, income, socioeconomic occupational class, stressful life events, and social desirability (Î² = 0.32-.42, ps < .001). Second, MAAS scores showed satisfactory short-term test-retest reliability in 100 retested healthy university students. Finally, MAAS sample mean scores as well as individuals' scores demonstrated satisfactory test-retest reliability across a 6 months interval in the adult community (retested N = 407), intraclass correlations â‰¥ .74. MAAS scores displayed significantly stronger long-term test-retest reliability than scores measuring psychological distress (z = 2.78, p = .005). Test-retest reliability estimates did not differ within demographic and socioeconomic strata. Scores on the Danish MAAS were psychometrically validated in healthy adults. MAAS's inattentiveness scores reflected a unidimensional construct, long-term reliable disposition, and a factor of independent significance for predicting psychological health.

1005,Effects of poverty on interacting biological systems underlying child development,"The developmental sequelae of childhood poverty are well documented. However, it is not poverty per se, but a multitude of risk factors associated with poverty that have a deleterious effect on children's development. Key risks factors that are likely to contribute to the adverse developmental effects of poverty include, for instance, food insecurity, infectious disease, and psychological stress related to the child's rearing environment. In this Review, we highlight synergistic biological pathways through which co-occurring risks related to poverty interact to shape children's neurocognitive development. We focus on pathways related to neural growth, energy metabolism, inflammation, and neuroendocrine responses to stress as key biological axes through which poverty becomes biologically embedded and might have long-term effects on children's neurocognitive development. We also discuss how biomarkers targeting these axes can be used to advance research on the biological processes through which poverty affects children's cognitive outcomes. Although the discussion has global relevance, we focus on low-resource settings where rates of poverty are highest and access to treatment might be limited.

An active coping style, high self-efficacy and Sense of Coherence (SOC) are found to increase RTW and high hostility and over-commitment to decrease RTW. Besides health elements in work ability are SOC, self-efficacy, social support and physical activity. Work ability and active coping mediate positive associations between RTW and health, and a negative association with stress.CONCLUSIONS: Work ability seems to express the intention to work decisive for RTW, reflecting the interpretation of the work/health situation based on comprehensibility, meaningfulness and manageability. It is influenced by the personal view of life, attitudes and interaction with the workplace. An ecological theory, integrating health promotion is proposed. A later paper will present the intervention study and further validation of the theory.","Jensen, Anne Grete Claudi",0,10.3233/WOR-121496,764

1009,Validation of the Korean version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2 in firefighters and rescue workers,"Objective Resilience has been considered as a protective factor against stress. Evaluating resilience in firefighters and rescue workers, who are frequently exposed to traumatic events, is important and relevant. This study examined the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2 (CD-RISC2). Methods Two-hundred twenty-two current professional firefighters and rescue workers were assessed by standardized, semi-structured clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires. Internal consistency, correlation with the CD-RISC, convergent validity, divergent validity, and predictive validity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity were analyzed. Results The CD-RISC2 demonstrated good internal consistency (Î± = 0.75), item-total correlation (r = 0.89-0.90), and convergent and divergent validity. The total score of the CD-RISC2 showed significant correlations with the subtotal of the remaining 23 CD-RISC items (r = 0.77, p < 0.001) and with the score of each CD-RISC item (r = 0.15-0.66, all p < 0.05). The magnitude of the relationship between the number of traumatic experiences and PTSD symptom severity was greater in the low resilience group than in the high resilience group (p for interaction = 0.002). The likelihood-ratio test confirmed that the model predicting PTSD symptom severity based on the CD-RISC2 total score was not improved by the inclusion of subtotal scores of the remaining 23 CD-RISC items (Ï‡2 = 0.31, p = 0.58). Conclusions These results suggest that the CD-RISC2 would be a valuable tool in evaluating resilience quickly and efficiently in firefighters and rescue workers. Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

1010,Psychosocial stress based on public speech in humans: is there a real life/laboratory setting cross-adaptation?,"Repeated or chronic exposure to stressors is associated with changes in neuroendocrine responses depending on the type, intensity, number and frequency of stress exposure as well as previous stress experience. The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that salivary cortisol and cardiovascular responses to real-life psychosocial stressors related to public performance can cross-adapt with responses to psychosocial stress induced by public speech under laboratory setting. The sample consisted of 22 healthy male volunteers, which were either actors, more precisely students of dramatic arts or non-actors, students of other fields. The stress task consisted of 15 min anticipatory preparation phase and 15 min of public speech on an emotionally charged topic. The actors, who were accustomed to public speaking, responded with a rise in salivary cortisol as well as blood pressure to laboratory public speech. The values of salivary cortisol, systolic blood pressure and state anxiety were lower in actors compared to non-actors. Unlike non-actors, subjects with experience in public speaking did not show stress-induced rise in the heart rate. Evaluation of personality traits revealed that actors scored significantly higher in extraversion than the subjects in the non-actor group. In conclusion, neuroendocrine responses to real-life stressors in actors can partially cross-adapt with responses to psychosocial stress under laboratory setting. The most evident adaptation was at the level of heart rate responses. The public speech tasks may be of help in evaluation of the ability to cope with stress in real life in artists by simple laboratory testing.

1011,Errors Caused by Non-Work-Conjugate Stress and Strain Measures and Necessary Corrections in Finite Element Programs,"Many finite element programs including standard commercial software such as ABAQUS use an incremental finite strain formulation that is not fully work-conjugate, i.e., the work of stress increments on the strain increments does not give a second-order accurate expression for work. In particular, the stress increments based on the Jaumann rate of Kirchhoff stress are work-conjugate with the increments of the Hencky (logarithmic) strain tensor but are paired in many finite element programs with the increments of Green's Lagrangian strain tensor. Although this problem was pointed out as early 1971, a demonstration of its significance in realistic situations has been lacking. Here it is shown that, in buckling of compressed highly orthotropic columns or sandwich columns that are very ""soft"" in shear, the use of such nonconjugate stress and strain increments can cause large errors, as high as 100% of the critical load, even if the strains are small. A similar situation may arise when severe damage such as distributed cracking leads to a highly anisotropic tangential stiffness matrix, or when axial cracks between fibers severely weaken a uniaxial fiber composite or wood. A revision of these finite element programs is advisable, and will in fact be easy-it will suffice to replace the Jaumann rate with the Truesdell rate. Alternatively, the Green's Lagrangian strain could be replaced with the Hencky strain.","Ji, W; Waas, AM; Bazant, ZP",0,10.1115/1.4000916,768

In addition, supportive work was undertaken with families. Control subjects received day care alone. In the experimental group, there were greater gains in language abilities, significant increases in caregivers' knowledge about autism, greater perception of control on the part of mothers, and greater parent satisfaction. We conclude that this research design demonstrated that the intervention was significantly superior to day care alone.","Jocelyn L.J., Casiro O.G., Beattie D., Bow J., Kneisz J.",0,10.1097/00004703-199810000-00002,769
1014,A network-individual-resource model for HIV prevention,"HIV is transmitted through dyadic exchanges of individuals linked in transitory or permanent networks of varying sizes. A theoretical perspective that bridges key individual level elements with important network elements can be a complementary foundation for developing and implementing HIV interventions with outcomes that are more sustainable over time and have greater dissemination potential. Toward that end, we introduce a Network-Individual-Resource (NIR) model for HIV prevention that recognizes how exchanges of resources between individuals and their networks underlies and sustains HIV-risk behaviors. Individual behavior change for HIV prevention, then, may be dependent on increasing the supportiveness of that individual's relevant networks for such change. Among other implications, an NIR model predicts that the success of prevention efforts depends on whether the prevention efforts (1) prompt behavior changes that can be sustained by the resources the individual or their networks possess; (2) meet individual and network needs and are consistent with the individual's current situation/developmental stage; (3) are trusted and valued; and (4) target high HIV-prevalence networks.

Case study results can then be applied by decision makers to adopt and evaluate the relative effectiveness of wellness programs. This case study assessed outcomes from Transtheoretical Model (TTM) computer-tailored interventions (CTIs) on 6 behaviors over a 5-year period. Results were compared with outcomes from a series of TTM randomized controlled trials and a representative review of workplace wellness interventions. The case study included 6544 employees, their spouses, and adult dependents who participated in a multicomponent CTI that assessed health risks and provided tailored feedback. Case study results were compared with 26 outcomes from 14 randomized controlled TTM-based CTIs, and with results from a published review of worksite-based wellness programs. The outcomes of the dissemination study were comparable to the average results of the TTM-based randomized controlled trials on stress and depression but exceeded the averages on smoking, healthy eating, fruit and vegetable consumption, and exercise by 16.4% to 44.8%. The dissemination study also exceeded by 89.3% to 7 times the average results of the workplace wellness interventions. The comparisons applied in this project represent a demanding test of the effectiveness of case studies. Length of treatment and choice of treatments are factors that may have contributed to above-average outcomes.","Johnson, Janet L.; Prochaska, James O.; Paiva, Andrea L.; Fernandez, Anne C.; DeWees, Sonja L.; Prochaska, Janice M.",0,10.1089/pop.2012.0094,772
1017,"Horses Working in Therapeutic Riding Programs: Cortisol, Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, Glucose, and Behavior Stress Indicators","In order to determine horses' stress and ensure health and welfare of horses working with military veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a therapeutic horseback riding program, we measured the stress levels of the horses. Five horses worked in two 6 week therapeutic riding sessions: one 6-week session ridden by military veterans with PTSD (session 1) and one 6-week session ridden by experienced riders (session 2). Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), glucose, and cortisol levels were determined on a resting day (baseline [BL]) and in weeks 1, 3, and 6 before each riding class (T1), after tacking (T2), and after each riding class (T3). Behavioral patterns for stress were determined before venipuncture at the same intervals. In session 1, cortisol level at BL was significantly lower than at T1 and T3, whereas in session 2, it was significantly higher than at T1 and T3. Cortisol level in session 1 was significantly higher than session 2 at T1 and T3. No significant differences were found between two sessions or over time for ACTH. Glucose level at BL was significantly higher than at T3 in session 1 and higher than at T1 in session 2. Glucose level in session 1 was significantly higher than session 2 at T1, T2, and T3. Stress behavior scores were significantly lower in session 1 than session 2. Although physiological and behavioral patterns for stress varied across experimental conditions, they remained within normal reference ranges. There was no evidence that horses carrying riders with a disability were unduly stressed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

1018,Interactive effects from self-reported physical and psychosocial factors in the workplace on neck pain and disability in female office workers,"This study explored the interaction between physical and psychosocial factors in the workplace on neck pain and disability in female computer users. A self-report survey was used to collect data on physical risk factors (monitor location, duration of time spent using the keyboard and mouse) and psychosocial domains (as assessed by the Job Content Questionnaire). The neck disability index was the outcome measure. Interactions among the physical and psychosocial factors were examined in analysis of covariance. High supervisor support, decision authority and skill discretion protect against the negative impact of (1) time spent on computer-based tasks, (2) non-optimal placement of the computer monitor and (3) long duration of mouse use. Office workers with greater neck pain experience a combination of high physical and low psychosocial stressors at work. Prevention and intervention strategies that target both sets of risk factors are likely to be more successful than single intervention programmes.Statement of Relevance: The results of this study demonstrate that the interaction of physical and psychosocial factors in the workplace has a stronger association with neck pain and disability than the presence of either factor alone. This finding has important implications for strategies aimed at the prevention of musculoskeletal problems in office workers.","Johnston, V.; Jull, G.; Souvlis, T.; Jimmieson, N.

Deaf adults may experience unique Stressors, in addition to circumstances associated with increased stress in the general population. The Perceived Stress Scale (S. Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983) was used as a pretest and posttest measure for participants in a study of the Deaf Heart Health Intervention. Results indicated that (a) some Deaf adults may have higher levels of perceived stress than the general population, and (b) culturally appropriate stress management interventions are promising as a means of assisting Deaf adults to decrease levels of perceived stress, and hence decrease risk for stress-related illnesses. Future research will focus on obtaining a larger, more diverse sample of Deaf adults and refining the intervention for maximum effectiveness.","Jones E.G., Ouellette S.E., Kang Y.",0,,775
1020,Evaluating the impact of a worksite stress management programme for distressed student nurses: A randomised controlled trial,"The effectiveness of a stress management intervention designed to reduce affective distress in 79 student nurses who previously reported significant distress, was evaluated by comparing stress management with wait-list control. The intervention had reliable, positive effects on affective outcomes including General Health Questionnaire-30, State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, and a measure of domestic satisfaction. The intervention also led to an increase in Direct Coping use. State Anxiety immediately preceding two important examinations, i.e. at 3 and 18 month follow-up, was lower for students receiving stress management. However, no effect was detected on sickness, absence and examination performance following this intervention. Stress management delivered in groups reduces affective distress and increases adaptive coping use in both clinical and academic settings.","Jones M.C., Johnston D.W.",0,10.1080/08870440008405480,776
1022,Influence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and catechol O-methyl transferase polymorphisms on effects of meditation on plasma catecholamines and stress,"Meditation may show differential effects on stress and plasma catecholamines based on genetic polymorphisms in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and catechol O-methyl transferase (COMT). Eighty adults (40 men, 40 women; mean age 26 years) who practiced meditation regularly and 57 healthy control adults (35 men, 22 women; mean age 26 years) participated. Plasma catecholamines (norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and dopamine (DA)) concentrations were measured, and a modified form of the Stress Response Inventory was administered. The results were analyzed using two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with control and meditation subjects, gene polymorphism as factors, and meditation duration as the covariate. Two-way ANCOVA showed a significant interaction between control and meditation subjects, and BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on DA/NE+DA/E (p = 0.042) and NE/E+NE/DA (p = 0.046) ratios. A significant interaction was found for control and meditation subjects with COMT Val158Met polymorphism and plasma NE concentrations (p = 0.009). Post hoc ANCOVA in the meditation group, adjusted for meditation duration, showed significantly higher plasma NE concentrations for COMT Met carriers than COMT Val/Val subjects (p = 0.025). Significant differences of stress levels were found between the control and meditation subjects in BDNF Val/Met (p < 0.001) and BDNF Met/Met (p = 0.003), whereas stress levels in the BDNF Val/Val genotype did not differ between the control and meditation groups. This is the first evidence that meditation produces different effects on plasma catecholamines according to BDNF or COMT polymorphisms.","Jung Y.-H., Kang D.-H., Byun M.S., Shim G., Kwon S.J., Jang G.-E., Lee U.S., An S.C., Jang J.H., Kwon J.S.",0,10.3109/10253890.2011.592880,777

This article first reviews the AL model, followed by interactions among early adversity, genetics, environmental toxins, as well as distinctions among sex, gender, and sex hormones as integral antecedents of AL. We next explore perspectives on severe mental illness, dementia, and caregiving as unique human models of AL that merit future investigations in the field of developmental psychopathology. A complimenting transdisciplinary perspective is applied throughout, whereby we argue that the AL model goes beyond traditional stress-disease theories toward the advancement of person-centered research and practice that promote not only physical health but also mental health.

1024,How much psychological distress is experienced at home by patients with palliative care needs in Germany? A cross-sectional study using the Distress Thermometer,"Objective: The aims of the present study were (1) to describe the prevalence of psychosocial distress in palliative care patients living at home and the related factors, and (2) to test implementation of the Distress Thermometer (DT) within a home-based palliative care service. Method: Ours was a 15-month prospective study beginning in September of 2013 in western Germany with consecutive patients cared for by a home care palliative care service. The research was implemented during the first visit by the home care team. Patients were excluded if they were under 18 years of age, mentally or physically unable to complete the assessment questionnaires as judged by their healthcare worker, or unable to understand the German language. During the first encounter, the Distress Thermometer (DT), a Problem List (PL), and a structured questionnaire for evaluation were applied and sociodemographic and medical data collected. Results: A total of 103 patients (response rate = 70%; mean age = 67; female = 54%; married = 67%; oncological condition = 91%; Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] score 0-40 = 34%, 50-70 = 60%, >80 = 6%) were included. The incidence of distress (DT score â‰¥4) was 89.3% (mean = 6.3 Â± 2.5). No statistical association was found between level of distress and sociodemographic or medical factors. The five most reported problems were fatigue (90%), getting around (84%), eating (63%), bathing/dressing (60%), and sleep (57%). The number of problems reported correlated with level of distress (Ï = 0.34). The DT was comprehensible, and 80% considered its completion as unremarkable, while 14% found it relieving. Significance of results: A significant proportion of patients treated at home reported symptoms of distress. The most oft-mentioned problems were physical and emotional in nature. The findings of our study highlight the importance of creating new concepts and structures in order to address the psychosocial needs of patients in home care with palliative needs.

1025,Effects of mailed advice on stress reduction among employees in Japan: A randomized controlled trial,"We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effects of mailed advice on reducing psychological distress, blood pressure, serum lipids, and sick leave of workers employed in a manufacturing plant in Japan. Those who indicated higher psychological distress (defined as having GHQ scores of three or greater) in the baseline questionnaire survey (n=226) were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group. Individualized letters were sent to the subjects of the intervention group, informing them of their stress levels and recommending an improvement in daily habits and other behaviors to reduce stress. Eighty-one and 77 subjects in the intervention and control groups, respectively, responded to, the one-year follow-up survey. No significant intervention effect was observed for the GHQ scores, blood pressure, serum lipids, or sick leave (p>0.05). The intervention effect was marginally significant for changes in regular breakfasts and daily alcohol consumption (p=0.09). The intervention effect was marginally significant for the GHQ scores among those who initially did not eat breakfast regularly (p=0.06). The study suggests that only sending mailed advice is not an effective measure for worksite stress reduction. Mailed advice which focuses on a particular subgroup (e.g., those who do not eat breakfast regularly) may be more effective.","Kawakami, N; Haratani, T; Iwata, N; Imanaka, Y; Murata, K; Araki, S",0,10.2486/indhealth.37.237,780

A randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effects of web-based supervisor training on worksite mental health on supervisor support and psychological distress among subordinate workers.Methods. Section chiefs in a computer engineering company were randomly assigned to either a training group (n = 9) or a non-training group (n = 7). The section chiefs in the training group participated in web-based self-learning training on worksite mental health. A total of 92 subordinate workers under the trained section chiefs (the intervention group) and 84 subordinate workers under the untrained section chiefs (the control group) completed a questionnaire at baseline and a 3-month follow-up.Results. The score of supervisor support greatly decreased in the control group during the follow-up period, and the score changed very little in the intervention group, with a significant intervention effect (P = 0.032). This pattern was more pronounced for one particular item dealing with the extent to which a supervisor listens to personal problems of subordinate workers (the intervention effect, P = 0.012). No intervention effect was observed for the score measuring co-worker support, psychological distress, or other job stressors among subordinate workers (P > 0.05).Conclusions.

A total of eight workplaces of a sales and service company were randomly assigned to either training workplaces or non-training workplaces. Supervisors (n=23) at the training workplaces participated in web-based self-learning training on worksite mental health; supervisors (n=23) at the nontraining workplaces did not. A total of 81 subordinate workers under the trained supervisors (the intervention group) and 108 subordinate workers under the nontrained supervisors (the control group) completed the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ) at baseline and at a three-month follow-up. No significant intervention effect was observed for any scale of the BJSQ measuring job stressors, supervisor or coworker support, or psychological distress among subordinate workers (p > 0.05). The item score of work autonomy changed very little in the intervention group, while it decreased in the control group during the follow-up period, yielding a significant intervention effect (p=0.02). The item score for a friendly atmosphere in the workplace increased in the intervention group, while the score remained stable in the control group, yielding a significant intervention effect (p=0.02). While the present study failed to show any clear effect of the webbased training of supervisors on reduction of job stressors, it may be useful for maintaining worker autonomy and improving the friendliness of the worksite atmosphere.","Kawakami, N; Takao, S; Kobayashi, Y; Tsutsumi, A",1,10.1539/joh.48.28,782
1028,Multidisciplinary group rehabilitation versus individual physiotherapy for chronic nonspecific low back pain - A randomized trial,"Study Design. A randomized trial.Objective. To evaluate the effectiveness of a semi-intensive multidisciplinary rehabilitation for patients with chronic low back pain in an outpatient setting.Summary and Background Data. Systematic reviews have shown that there is strong evidence that intensive multidisciplinary treatment (> 100 hours), which includes functional restoration, improves function among chronic patients with low back pain, and moderate evidence that it reduces pain but contradictory evidence regarding improvement of working ability. However, there is paucity of data whether semi-intensive outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation in groups is more effective than individual physiotherapy.Materials and Methods. A total of 120 women employed as healthcare and social care professionals with nonspecific chronic low back pain were recruited from two occupational healthcare centers. The patients were randomized into two intervention programs. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation (n = 59) was conducted in groups and comprised of physical training, workplace interventions, back school, relaxation training, and cognitive-behavioral stress management methods for 70 hours. The individual physiotherapy (n = 61) included physical exercise and passive treatment methods administered for 10 hours. Main outcome measures were: back pain and sciatic pain intensity, disability, sick leaves, healthcare consumption, symptoms of depression, and beliefs of working ability after 2 years. Results. There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in main outcome measures just after rehabilitation, at 6-, at 12-, or 24- month follow- up. In both intervention arms, however, the before- and- after comparison showed favorable effects, and the effects were still maintained at 2 years follow- up.Conclusions. The results of this study indicate that semilight outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for female chronic low back pain patients does not offer incremental benefits when compared with rehabilitation carried out by a physiotherapist having a cognitivebehavioral way of administering the treatment.","Kaapa, EH; Frantsi, K; Sarna, S; Malmivaara, A",0,,783

Method: CGs (N = 150) were randomly assigned to the iCare Condition (ICC) or to the Education/Information-Only Condition (EOC) for a 3-month period. Change in self-report measures of stress (PSS) (primary outcome), caregiver bother (RMBPC), depression (CES-D), and quality of life (PQOL) (secondary outcomes) was determined, along with usage of new information in one's own caregiving. Results: A mixed ANOVA revealed that change in perceived stress was significant for the ICC but not the EOC (p = .017). Changes in the other measures were not significant. More caregivers in the ICC used the materials in their own caregiving situation than those in the EOC. Roughly one-third of the caregivers enrolled in the study dropped prior to completion. Conclusion: Results are promising, but the high dropout is a concern. Future efforts to improve dropout rate and increase participant engagement are warranted.

1031,Guided internet cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia compared to a control treatment - A randomized trial,"Aim: To evaluate if internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (ICBT-i) with brief therapist support outperforms an active control treatment. Method: Adults diagnosed with insomnia were recruited via media (n=148) and randomized to either eight weeks of ICBT-i or an active internet-based control treatment. Primary outcome was the insomnia severity index (ISI) assessed before and after treatment, with follow-ups after 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were use of sleep medication, sleep parameters (sleep diary), perceived stress, and a screening of negative treatment effects. Hierarchical Linear Mixed Models were used for intent-to-treat analyses and handling of missing data. Results: ICBT-i was significantly more effective than the control treatment in reducing ISI (Cohen's d=0.85), sleep medication, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and sleep quality at post-treatment. The positive effects were sustained. However, after 12 months the difference was no longer significant due to a continuous decrease in ISI among controls, possibly due to their significantly higher utilization of insomnia relevant care after treatment. Forty-six negative effects were reported but did not differ between interventions. Conclusions: Supported ICBT-i is more effective than an active control treatment in reducing insomnia severity and treatment gains remain stable one year after treatment.

Aims: To test if improvement of insomnia during treatment of chronic fatigue was associated with improved outcomes on 1) fatigue and 2) cortisol recovery span during a standardized stress exposure. Methods: Patients (n. =. 122) with chronic fatigue received a 3.5-week inpatient return-to-work rehabilitation program based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and had been on paid sick leave. >. 8. weeks due their condition. A physician and a psychologist examined the patients, assessed medication use, and SCID-I diagnoses. Patients completed self-report questionnaires measuring fatigue, pain, depression, anxiety, and insomnia before and after treatment. A subgroup (n. =. 25) also completed the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups (TSST-G) before and after treatment. Seven cortisol samples were collected during each test and cortisol spans for the TSST-G were calculated. Results: A hierarchical regression analysis in nine steps showed that insomnia improvement predicted improvement in fatigue, independently of age, gender, improvement in pain intensity, depression and anxiety. A second hierarchical regression analysis showed that improvement in insomnia significantly predicted the cortisol recovery span after the TSST-G independently of improvement in fatigue. Conclusion: Improvement in insomnia severity had a significant impact on both improvement in fatigue and the ability to recover from a stressful situation. Insomnia severity may be a maintaining factor in chronic fatigue and specifically targeting this in treatment could increase treatment response.

1034,Gender differences in automatic thoughts and cortisol and alpha-amylase responses to acute psychosocial stress in patients with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,"Introduction Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) has a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfection, and mental and interpersonal control at the expense of flexibility, openness, and efficiency. The aims of the present study were to explore the relationship between OCPD and psychological stress and psychological tests. Methods We evaluated 63 OCPD patients and 107 healthy controls (HCs). We collected saliva samples from patients and controls before and after a social stress procedure, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), to measure the concentrations of salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) and salivary cortisol. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Profile of Mood State (POMS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Social Adaptation Self-Evaluation Scale (SASS), and Depression and Anxiety Cognition Scale (DACS) were administered to patients and HCs. Results Following TSST exposure, the salivary amylase and cortisol levels were significantly decreased in male patients compared with controls. Additionally, OCPD patients had higher CTQ, POMS, STAI, and BDI scores than HCs and exhibited significantly higher anxiety and depressive states. OCPD patients scored higher on future denial and threat prediction as per the DACS tool. According to a stepwise regression analysis, STAI, POMS, and salivary cortisol responses were independent predictors of OCPD. Conclusions Our results suggested that attenuated sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity in male OCPD patients occurs along with attenuated salivary amylase and cortisol responses to the TSST. In addition, there was a significant difference between OCPD patients and HCs in child trauma, mood, anxiety, and cognition. The finding support the modeling role of cortisol (20Â min) on the relationships between STAI trait and depression among OCPD.

1035,Psychological distress in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients,"Stress is defined as the exposure of an individual to a threatening stimulus or overwhelming event. Increased rates of psychological distress have been established in patients with chronic diseases compared to healthy individuals. The objective of the present study is to assess the indicators and correlates of psychological distress in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. We evaluated the stress exposure (stressful events that COPD patients and control subjects had been exposed) by a life events checklist and psychological distress by General Health Questionnaire in 74 COPD patients and 30 control subjects. Serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels were measured as biochemical indicators of stress. Distress score was higher in COPD group compared to age-matched controls, although the stress exposure score were not statistically different; indicating that COPD itself is a source of distress. 92% of COPD patients and 87% of control subjects had varying degrees of distress. Severe distress was more frequent in COPD group. Distress score was further increased in patients with severe COPD and severe hypoxemia. There was no significant difference in serum ACTH and cortisol levels of COPD patients and control subjects and distress scores were not correlated to serum ACTH and cortisol levels. However, serum cortisol was higher in patients with severe hypoxemia. These findings support the importance of screening for psychological distress symptoms in COPD outpatients. Since high degree of distress contributes to impaired quality of life and added morbidity, patients with COPD need a comprehensive care including a psychological evaluation.

However, given the physical and psychological changes, it can induce a degree of stress and anxiety in mothers. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) on maternal anxiety and depression during pregnancy and newborns' Apgar scores. Methods: This semi-experimental study was performed by applying a pretest-posttest control-group design. Overall, 30 primiparous mothers were selected among women referring to health clinics of Kerman, Iran, using convenience sampling. Subjects were randomly allocated to experimental and control groups. Data were collected, using Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Questionnaire and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Questionnaire. After completing the pretest, the experimental group was subjected to 12 sessions of CBSM training; posttest data were collected after the intervention. Multivariate analysis of covariance was performed, using SPSS version 16. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The obtained results revealed a significant decrement in the average posttest scores of anxiety and depression in the experimental group, compared to pretest scores and the control group. Moreover, differences in 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores between the two groups were statistically significant. These findings indicated the effectiveness of CBSM during pregnancy in reducing maternal anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Pregnant women can benefit from psychological interventions such as CBSM in medical and health care centers.","Karamoozian M., Askarizadeh G.",0,,792
1041,"Smoking, Stress, and Negative Affect: Correlation, Causation, and Context Across Stages of Smoking","This transdisciplinary review of the literature addresses the questions, Do stress and negative affect (NA) promote smoking? and Does smoking genuinely relieve stress and NA? Drawing on both human and animal literatures, the authors examine these questions across three developmental stages of smoking - initiation, maintenance, and relapse. Methodological and conceptual distinctions relating to within- and between-subjects levels of analyses are emphasized throughout the review. Potential mechanisms underlying links between stress and NA and smoking are also reviewed. Relative to direct-effect explanations, the authors argue that contextual mediator-moderator approaches hold greater potential for elucidating complex associations between NA and stress and smoking. The authors conclude with recommendations for research initiatives that draw on more sophisticated theories and methodologies.","Kassel J.D., Stroud L.R., Paronis C.A.",0,10.1037/0033-2909.129.2.270,793
1042,A school-based mental health program for traumatized latino immigrant children,"Objective: To pilot-test a school mental health program for Latino immigrant students who have been exposed to community violence. Method: In this quasi-experimental study conducted from January through June 2000, 198 students in third through eighth grade with trauma-related depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were compared after receiving an intervention or being on a waitlist. The intervention consisted of a manual-based, eight-session, group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) delivered in Spanish by bilingual, bicultural school social workers. Parents and teachers were eligible to receive psychoeducation and support services. Results: Students in the intervention group (n = 152) had significantly greater improvement in posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms compared with those on the waitlist (n = 47) at 3-month follow-up, adjusting for relevant covariates. Conclusions: A collaborative research team of school clinicians, educators, and researchers developed this trauma-focused CBT program for Latino immigrant students and their families. This pilot test demonstrated that this program for traumatized youths, designed for delivery on school campuses by school clinicians, can be implemented and evaluated in the school setting and is associated with a modest decline in trauma-related mental health problems.","Kataoka S.H., Stein B.D., Jaycox L.H., Wong M., Escudero P., Tu W., Zaragoza C., Fink A.",0,10.1097/00004583-200303000-00011,794
1043,The future of cognitive and behavioral therapies in the prevention and early management of psychosis: Opportunities and risks,"Behavioral and cognitive interventions for people with psychosis have a long and distinguished history, although the evidence for their application to young people remains limited. We anticipate that the next decades will show substantial research into psychological intervention for this population. Important targets will include the management of environmental stressors, reduction of substance misuse, and promotion of early treatment. Psychological management of positive symptoms, depression, and suicidal behavior will continue to be critical objectives. Important secondary prevention goals will be the retention of cognitive functioning, vocational options, social skills, and social network support, including appropriate family support. We expect primary prevention to include both universal programs and interventions for adolescents at particularly high risk. Technical innovations will include increasing use of Internet-based intervention and behavior cueing devices. Pressures for intervention brevity will continue, as will problems with the systematic delivery of effective procedures.","Kavanagh D.J., Mueser K.T.",0,10.1016/S0005-7894(01)80016-2,795

All children (N = 127, ages 6-14 years) and their families received problem-solving skills training (PSST), and parents received parent management training (PMT). Families were randomly assigned to receive or not to receive an additional component (PPS) that addressed parental stress over the course of treatment. Children improved with treatment; the PPS intervention enhanced therapeutic change for children and parents and reduced the barriers that parents experienced during treatment. The implications of the findings for improving evidence-based treatment as well as the limitations of adding components to treatment are detailed.","Kazdin A.E., Whitley M.K.",0,10.1037/0022-006X.71.3.504,796

However, there are almost no measures available for its assessment. We aimed to analyze the psychometric properties of a brief version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 adjustment disorder scale (Adjustment Disorder New Module-8; ADNM-8) in a help-seeking sample. Data from 1,174 participants with an average age of 35 years who registered for the internet-based self-help adjustment disorder intervention were analyzed. Psychometric properties of the brief 8-item self-report (ADNM-8) scale measuring the 2 core adjustment disorder symptoms of preoccupation and failure to adapt were tested. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied for the analysis of construct validity. CFA supported the 2-factor structure of ADNM-8. Further research is needed for validation of ADNM-8 in cross-cultural studies. Â© 2017 S.

1048,Early interventions for PTSD: A review,"The high prevalence of trauma exposure and subsequent negative consequences for both survivors and society as a whole emphasize the need for secondary prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder. However, clinicians and relief workers remain limited in their ability to intervene effectively in the aftermath of trauma and alleviate traumatic stress reactions that can lead to chronic PTSD. The scientific literature on early intervention for PTSD is reviewed, including early studies on psychological debriefing, pharmacological, and psychosocial interventions aimed at preventing chronic PTSD. Studies on fear extinction and memory consolidation are discussed in relation to PTSD prevention and the potential importance of immediate versus delayed intervention approaches and genetic predictors are briefly reviewed. Preliminary results from a modified prolonged exposure intervention applied within hours of trauma exposure in an emergency room setting are discussed, along with considerations related to intervention reach and overall population impact. Suggestions for future research are included. Prevention of PTSD, although currently not yet a reality, remains an exciting and hopeful possibility with current research approaches translating work from the laboratory to the clinic.

1049,Cutting edge research on prevention of PTSD,"Many studies have indicated that trauma exposure is highly prevalent with widespread negative consequences for both individuals and society as a whole. However, there are still no widely recommended treatment interventions that have demonstrated effectiveness at preventing the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Thus, although many individuals will experience natural recovery following exposure to a traumatic event, there are others who are at risk for chronic symptoms of traumatic stress, and there is a great need for effective interventions that are available in the immediate aftermath of a trauma that can assist these individuals and prevent PTSD. The following chapter provides an overview of predictors of PTSD development and reviews research on both psychological and pharmacological treatments that have been studied as potential early interventions for PTSD. In addition, the role of extinction and habituation in the development of PTSD is examined, along with cutting-edge translational research on an early exposure-based intervention for PTSD delivered to emergency room patients. Conclusions and suggestions for future research are discussed.

1050,The effects of a parent-focused intervention for children with a recent diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder on parenting stress and competence,"This paper reports on the effects of two types of parent-focused intervention, for parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 2-4 years and within 6 months of diagnosis, on parent's perceptions of stress and competence. Interventions aimed to decrease parenting stress and increase parenting competence by embedding empirically supported parenting strategies within family routines. Families were assigned to a professionally supported intervention that included a workshop and 10 home-visits (n = 17) or to a self-directed video based intervention (n = 22). Development in social communication was greater for children of families receiving professional support as measured by a caregiver questionnaire but not on a clinically measured behavior sample. Improvements in adaptive behavior were greater for children in the professionally supported intervention when relatively low adaptive behavior scores had been demonstrated at pre-intervention. The professionally supported intervention resulted in reduced child-related parenting stress and increased parenting self-efficacy relative to the self-directed intervention. The findings support the importance of providing individualized information and professional support around the time of diagnosis for families who have a child with ASD. Â© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Method: Information booklets provided to participants within 72 h of the initial trauma detailed common responses to trauma, the common time course of symptoms, and suggestions for minimizing any post-trauma distress. Following admission for traumatic injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents, falls and sporting injuries a total of 103 children (aged 7-15) and their parents were evaluated at pre-intervention, 1 month, and 6 months post-trauma. The intervention (N = 33) was delivered to one of two hospitals, the second hospital was the control (N = 70). Results: Analyses indicated that the intervention reduced child anxiety symptoms at 1-month follow-up and parental posttraumatic intrusion symptoms and overall posttraumatic symptoms at the 6-month follow-up. No other differences between the intervention and control groups were found. Conclusion: Overall, the information-based early intervention is simple, cost-effective method of reducing child and parent distress post-trauma.

1054,A 12-MONTH EXERCISE INTERVENTION DECREASED STRESS SYMPTOMS AND INCREASED MENTAL RESOURCES AMONG WORKING ADULTS - RESULTS PERCEIVED AFTER A 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP,"Objectives: This study evaluated the effect of a 12-month physical exercise intervention accompanied by a 12-month follow-up evaluating stress symptoms (SS), mental resources (MR) and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in healthy, working adults. We hypothesized that the stress symptoms would decrease and mental resources would increase during the intervention and that these results are associated with changes in CRF. Material and Methods: The study group included healthy adults (N = 371). Three hundred thirty eight participants (212 women, 126 men) were allocated in the exercise group and 33 in the control group (17 women and 16 men). For the analysis, the exercise group was divided into subgroups according to the baseline SS and MR. Stress symptoms and MR were measured using the Occupational Stress Questionnaire. Results: During the 12-month exercise intervention, SS decreased by 16% (p < 0.0001), MR increased by 8% (p < 0.0001) and CRF increased by 7% (p < 0.0001) in the exercise group, while no changes occurred in the control group (ANCOVA, p < 0.01). In the exercise group, the results (SS, MR, and CRF) remained improved during the follow-up. There was a positive correlation between the change in SS and the change in CRF (r = 0.19, p < 0.01). In the subgroup having the highest SS at baseline, SS during the intervention decreased most (26%) (ANCOVA, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: One year physical exercise intervention improved mental well-being among working adults and this was associated with an improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness. The positive changes remained after the 12-month follow-up.","Kettunen, O; Vuorimaa, T; Vasankari, T",1,,802
1056,Effects of mindfulness on psychological health: A review of empirical studies,"Within the past few decades, there has been a surge of interest in the investigation of mindfulness as a psychological construct and as a form of clinical intervention. This article reviews the empirical literature on the effects of mindfulness on psychological health. We begin with a discussion of the construct of mindfulness, differences between Buddhist and Western psychological conceptualizations of mindfulness, and how mindfulness has been integrated into Western medicine and psychology, before reviewing three areas of empirical research: cross-sectional, correlational research on the associations between mindfulness and various indicators of psychological health; intervention research on the effects of mindfulness-oriented interventions on psychological health; and laboratory-based, experimental research on the immediate effects of mindfulness inductions on emotional and behavioral functioning. We conclude that mindfulness brings about various positive psychological effects, including increased subjective well-being, reduced psychological symptoms and emotional reactivity, and improved behavioral regulation. The review ends with a discussion on mechanisms of change of mindfulness interventions and suggested directions for future research.

1057,The Slow Down Program: A mixed methods pilot study of a mindfulness-based stress management and nutrition education program for mothers,"Objective: Stress levels have been associated with a broad range of adverse health outcomes, particularly for mothers and subsequently, their children. Mindfulness-based stress management is a tool that has effectively been utilized in several disciplines and has potential applications to eating behaviors. This paper describes the effects of an exploratory mindfulness-based stress management and nutrition education program, the Slow Down Program, on mothersâ€™ perceived stress, eating behavior, and self-efficacy. Design & setting: This study used a mixed methods quasi-experimental design. Nineteen mothers with young children (five or younger) participated in the study. The SDP consisted of four consecutive weekly 1.5 h sessions focused on experiential learning and facilitated discussion. Main outcome measures: Quantitative data were collected pre- and post-intervention and included: the Perceived Stress Scale; Mindfulness Self-Efficacy Scale; and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire Revised-18. Qualitative data included a focus group post-intervention and an individual interview 4â€“6 weeks post-intervention. Results: The SDP showed significant improvements in participantsâ€™ perceived stress (p =.04), uncontrolled eating (p < 0.01), cognitive restraint (p < 0.01), and mindfulness self-efficacy (p < 0.01). Qualitatively, participants also reported changes in self-efficacy and eating behaviors â€“ specifically improvements in mindful eating, and sensory and satiety awareness. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study demonstrate that nutrition programs incorporated with mindfulness strategies may offer positive, short-term impacts on stress reduction and eating behaviors. Additional studies are warranted across a variety of populations with more rigorous study designs to assess long-term effects.

1058,"Systematic Review of the Role of Occupational Health and Safety Interventions in the Prevention of Upper Extremity Musculoskeletal Symptoms, Signs, Disorders, Injuries, Claims and Lost Time","Background Little is known about the most effective occupational health and safety (OHS) interventions to reduce upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and injuries. Methods A systematic review used a best evidence synthesis approach to address the question: ""do occupational health and safety interventions have an effect on upper extremity musculoskeletal symptoms, signs, disorders, injuries, claims and lost time?"" Results The search identified 36 studies of sufficient methodological quality to be included in data extraction and evidence synthesis. Overall, a mixed level of evidence was found for OHS interventions. Levels of evidence for interventions associated with positive effects were: Moderate evidence for arm supports; and Limited evidence for ergonomics training plus workstation adjustments, new chair and rest breaks. Levels of evidence for interventions associated with ""no effect"" were: Strong evidence for workstation adjustment alone; Moderate evidence for biofeedback training and job stress management training; and Limited evidence for cognitive behavioral training. No interventions were associated with ""negative effects"". Conclusion It is difficult to make strong evidenced-based recommendations about what practitioners should do to prevent or manage upper extremity MSDs. There is a paucity of high quality OHS interventions evaluating upper extremity MSDs and none focused on traumatic injury outcomes or workplace mandated pre-placement screening exams. We recommend that worksites not engage in OHS activities that include only workstation adjustments. However, when combined with ergonomics training, there is limited evidence that workstation adjustments are beneficial. A practice to consider is using arm supports to reduce upper extremity MSDs.","Kennedy, Carol A.; Amick, Benjamin C., III; Dennerlein, Jack T.; Brewer, Shelley; Catli, Starly; Williams, Renee; Serra, Consol; Gerr, Fred; Irvin, Emma; Mahood, Quenby; Franzblau, Al; Van Eerd, Dwayne; Evanoff, Bradley; Rempel, David",0,10.1007/s10926-009-9211-2,805
1059,A pilot cluster randomised controlled trial of a support and training intervention to improve the mental health of secondary school teachers and students - the WISE (Wellbeing in Secondary Education) study,"Background: Secondary school teachers are at heightened risk of psychological distress, which can lead to poor work performance, poor quality teacher-student relationships and mental illness. A pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) - the WISE study - evaluated the feasibility of a full-scale RCT of an intervention to support school staff's own mental health, and train them in supporting student mental health.Methods: Six schools were randomised to an intervention or control group. In the intervention schools i) 8-9 staff received Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training and became staff peer supporters, and ii) youth MHFA training was offered to the wider staff body. Control schools continued with usual practice. We used thematic qualitative data analysis and regression modelling to ascertain the feasibility, acceptability and potential usefulness of the intervention.Results: Thirteen training observations, 14 staff focus groups and 6 staff interviews were completed, and 438 staff (43.5 %) and 1,862 (56.3 %) students (years 8 and 9) completed questionnaires at baseline and one year later. MHFA training was considered relevant for schools, and trainees gained in knowledge, confidence in helping others, and awareness regarding their own mental health. Suggestions for reducing the length of the training and focusing on helping strategies were made. A peer support service was established in all intervention schools and was perceived to be helpful in supporting individuals in difficulty - for example through listening, and signposting to other services - and raising the profile of mental health at a whole school level. Barriers to use included lack of knowledge about the service, concerns about confidentiality and a preference for accessing support from pre-existing networks.Conclusions: The WISE intervention is feasible and acceptable to schools. Results support the development of a full-scale cluster RCT, if steps are taken to improve response rates and implement the suggested improvements to the intervention.","Kidger, Judi; Stone, Tracey; Tilling, Kate; Brockman, Rowan; Campbell, Rona; Ford, Tamsin; Hollingworth, William; King, Michael; Araya, Ricardo; Gunnell, David",1,10.1186/s12889-016-3737-y,806
1060,A randomized trial of face-to-face counselling versus telephone counselling versus bibliotherapy for occupational stress,"Objective. The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness and acceptability of three interventions for occupational stress. Methods/design. A total of 90 National Health Service employees were randomized to face-to-face counselling or telephone counselling or bibliotherapy. Outcomes were assessed at post-intervention and 4-month follow-up. Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation (CORE), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) were used to evaluate intervention outcomes. An intention-to-treat analyses was performed. Results. Repeated measures analysis revealed significant time effects on all measures with the exception of CORE Risk. No significant group effects were detected on all outcome measures. No time by group significant interaction effects were detected on any of the outcome measures with the exception of CORE Functioning and GHQ total. With regard to acceptability of interventions, participants expressed a preference for face-to-face counselling over the other two modalities. Conclusions. Overall, it was concluded that the three intervention groups are equally effective. Given that bibliotherapy is the least costly of the three, results from the present study might be considered in relation to a stepped care approach to occupational stress management with bibliotherapy as the first line of intervention, followed by telephone and face-to-face counselling as required.

1061,Improving academic performance and mental health through a stress management intervention: Outcomes and mediators of change,"Two hundred and nine pupils were randomly allocated to either a cognitive behaviourally based stress management intervention (SMI) group, or a non-intervention control group. Mood and motivation measures were administered pre and post intervention. Standardized examinations were taken 8-10 weeks later. As hypothesized, results indicated that an increase in the functionality of pupils' cognitions served as the mechanism by which mental health improved in the SMI group. In contrast, the control group demonstrated no such improvements. Also, as predicted, an increase in motivation accounted for the SMI group's significantly better performance on the standardized, academic assessments that comprise the United Kingdom's General Certificate of Secondary Education. Indeed, the magnitude of this enhanced performance was, on average, one-letter grade. Discussion focuses on the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

1062,Effectiveness of a Comprehensive Stress Management Program to Reduce Work-Related Stress in a Medium-Sized Enterprise,"Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of a comprehensive workplace stress management program consisting of participatory action-oriented training (PAOT) and individual management.Methods: A comprehensive workplace stress management program was conducted in a medium-sized enterprise. The baseline survey was conducted in September 2011, using the Korean Occupational Stress Scale (KOSS) and Worker's Stress Response Inventory (WSRI). After implementing both organizational and individual level interventions, the follow up evaluation was conducted in November 2011.Results: Most of the workers participated in the organizational level PAOT and made Team-based improvement plans. Based on the stress survey, 24 workers were interviewed by a researcher. After the organizational and individual level interventions, there was a reduction of several adverse psychosocial factors and stress responses. In the case of blue-collar workers, psychosocial factors such as the physical environment, job demands, organizational system, lack of rewards, and occupational climate were significantly improved; in the case of white-collar workers, the occupational climate was improved.Conclusions: In light of these results, we concluded that the comprehensive stress management program was effective in reducing work-related stress in a short-term period. A persistent long-term follow up is necessary to determine whether the observed effects are maintained over time. Both team-based improvement activities and individual interviews have to be sustainable and complementary to each other under the long-term plan.

Treatments are informed by a biopsychosocial model of pain and a long history of psychological research that has identified the central role of behavioral, cognitive, and emotional factors that are believed to contribute to the perpetuation, if not the development, of chronic pain and pain-related disability and emotional distress. Empirically supported self-regulatory, behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and acceptance and commitment interventions are reviewed, and current and future interventions are highlighted. Important issues related to individual differences and disparities in the experience of pain and pain treatment are discussed.

The present study compared children of postpartum depressed mothers (n = 29) with children from a community sample (n = 113) in terms of a broad range of developmental outcomes in the early school period. Controlling for risk factors associated with maternal depression, we found that children of postpartum depressed mothers had lower ego-resiliency, lower peer social competence, and lower school adjustment than the community sample children. In addition, girls of postpartum depressed mothers showed lower verbal intelligence, and, unexpectedly, showed fewer externalizing problems than their counterparts in the community sample. Results show that children's capacities to deal with stress and interact with peers in the early school period may be particularly affected by their mothers' PPD.

1066,Mindful M&M's: Mindfulness and Parent Training for a Preschool Child with Disruptive Behavior Disorder,"Disruptive behavior problems are the primary reason for referral of preschool-aged children to mental health care settings and significantly interfere with social and academic functioning. Furthermore, when left untreated, disruptive behavior disorder may persist and cause impairments in social, academic, and occupational functioning in later developmental stages. Parent-based training programs are effective in ameliorating many symptoms of disruptive behavior disorders, but often neglect other child factors associated with disruptive behavior, such as deficits in emotion regulation. Mindfulness training may be an effective method for addressing these individual-level contributing factors underlying the child's disruptive behavior. At present, treatment outcome research on the efficacy of mindfulness training among preschool-aged children with disruptive behavior problems is highly limited. This case study examined the implementation of a two-part treatment consisting of a four-session parent-training program as well as four sessions of targeted mindfulness training for a preschool-aged child with disruptive behavior disorder. Treatment outcome data revealed significant gains, including improvements in emotion regulation and decreases in level of aggression, defiance, and sleep problems. Treatment gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up, along with further decreases in aggression, defiance, inattention, and hyperactivity, which resulted in no clinical-level symptoms at 6-months post-treatment. This case study demonstrates the potential efficacy of multi-strategy interventions for preschool-aged children with disruptive behavior problems and highlights mindfulness training as a promising adjunct to family-based interventions.

1068,Mindfulness-based stress reduction for healthy individuals: A meta-analysis,"Background: An increasing number of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) studies are being conducted with nonclinical populations, but very little is known about their effectiveness. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy, mechanisms of actions, and moderators of MBSR for nonclinical populations. Data sources: A systematic review of studies published in English journals in Medline, CINAHL or Alt HealthWatch from the first available date until September 19, 2014. Study selection: Any quantitative study that used MBSR as an intervention, that was conducted with healthy adults, and that investigated stress or anxiety. Results: A total of 29 studies (n = 2668) were included. Effect-size estimates suggested that MBSR is moderately effective in pre-post analyses (n = 26; Hedge's g = .55; 95% CI [.44, .66], p< .00001) and in between group analyses (n = 18; Hedge's g = .53; 95% CI [.41, .64], p< .00001). The obtained results were maintained at an average of 19 weeks of follow-up. Results suggested large effects on stress, moderate effects on anxiety, depression, distress, and quality of life, and small effects on burnout. When combined, changes in mindfulness and compassion measures correlated with changes in clinical measures at post-treatment and at follow-up. However, heterogeneity was high, probably due to differences in the study design, the implemented protocol, and the assessed outcomes. Conclusions: MBSR is moderately effective in reducing stress, depression, anxiety and distress and in ameliorating the quality of life of healthy individuals; however, more research is warranted to identify the most effective elements of MBSR.

1069,The effects of individual- and network-level factors on discussion of cancer experiences: Survivors of childhood cancer in Korea,"This study aimed to identify young adult Korean cancer survivors' individual- (psychological distress, stigma, sociodemographic variables, and cancer-related variables) and network-level factors (relationship type, social support type) that influence discussion of their cancer experiences. Sixty-eight survivors of childhood cancer who were recruited using snowball sampling nominated 245 individuals from their networks, including family and intimate partners (40%) and friends and acquaintances (60%), as people with whom they most frequently interacted. Results of multilevel modeling analysis indicated that higher levels of internalized shame were a prominent individual-level factor associated with a lack of discussion of cancer experiences. Relationship type and support type at the network-level were also significant correlates of discussion of cancer experiences. Programs for reducing the survivors' shame, improving illness identity, and providing professional training for building social relationships that are intimate and in which they could exchange reciprocal support may help Korean childhood cancer survivors to openly share their cancer experiences with others in their social network and to be successful in the journey of cancer survivorship.

Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, South Korea-Objectives: This was a randomized controlled pilot trial to evaluate the effectiveness of cupping therapy for neck pain in video display terminal (VDT) workers. Methods: Forty VDT workers with moderate to severe neck pain were recruited from May, 2011 to February, 2012. Participants were randomly allocated into one of the two interventions: 6 sessions of wet and dry cupping or heating pad application. The participants were offered an exercise program to perform during the participation period. A 0 to 100 numeric rating scale (NRS) for neck pain, measure yourself medical outcome profile 2 score (MYMOP2 score), cervical spine range of motion (C-spine ROM), neck disability index (NDI), the EuroQol health index (EQ-5D), short form stress response inventory (SRI-SF) and fatigue severity scale (FSS) were assessed at several points during a 7-week period. Results: Compared with a heating pad, cupping was more effective in improving pain (adjusted NRS difference: -1.29 [95% CI-1.61, -0.97] at 3 weeks (p=0.025) and -1.16 [-1.48, -0.84] at 7 weeks (p=0.005)), neck function (adjusted NDI difference: -0.79 [-1.11, -0.47] at 3 (p=0.0039) and 7 weeks (p<0.0001)) and discomfort (adjusted MYMOP2 difference score: -0.72 [-1.04 to -0.40] at 3 weeks and -0.92 [-1.24, -0.60] at 7 weeks). Significant improvement in EQ-5D was observed at 7 weeks (1.0 [0.88, 1.0] with cupping and 0.91 [0.86, 0.91] with heating pad treatment, p=0.0054). Four participants reported mild adverse events of cupping. Conclusion: Two weeks of cupping therapy and an exercise program may be effective in reducing pain and improving neck function in VDT workers.

1074,Enhancing physical and psychological functioning in older family caregivers: The role of regular physical activity,"Although informal caregiving among older adults creates a range of physical and psychological burdens for the caregiver, little research has been directed at evaluating strategies for preserving caregivers' physical functioning in addition to their psychological well-being. The purpose of the current research was to examine, through population-based survey sampling procedures, levels of physical activity and related health practices and preferences among a random sample of older family caregivers; evaluate, using an experimental design, the feasibility of initiating a four-month supervised home-based moderate-intensity physical activity regimen among older family caregivers; and explore the potential effects of physical activity on anger expression, caregiver burden, and related psychological outcomes in this population. The results suggest that: (a) physical inactivity is a prevalent risk factor among family caregivers that requires systematic attention; (b) a significant proportion of family caregivers of both sexes are interested in improving their physical activity levels, especially through programs that do not require ongoing attendance at a class or group; and (c) supervised home- based programs that focus on brisk walking and similar moderate-intensity physical activities appear to be both feasible and potentially beneficial in health (e.g. ambulatory blood pressure) as well as mental health (e.g. anger expression) areas.","King A.C., Brassington G.",0,10.1007/BF02883325,819
1076,Family-oriented services in pediatric rehabilitation: a scoping review and framework to promote parent and family wellness,"Family-oriented services are not as common as one would expect, given the widespread endorsement of family-centred care, the role of parents in supporting optimal child outcomes, and legislation and literature indicating that parent outcomes are important in their own right. There are no published service delivery frameworks describing the scope of services that could be delivered to promote parent and family wellness. A scoping review was conducted to identify types of family-oriented services for parents of children with physical disabilities and/or intellectual impairments. This information was then synthesized into a conceptual framework of services to inform service selection and design. A scoping review of the recent literature was performed to capture descriptions of services targeting parents/families of children with physical disabilities and/or intellectual impairments, published in a six-year period (2009 to 2014). Six databases were searched and 557 retrieved articles were screened using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thirty six relevant articles were identified. Based on descriptions of services in these articles, along with seminal articles describing the nature of desirable services, we propose a needs-based and capacity-enhancing framework outlining a continuum of family-oriented services for parents of children with disabilities. The framework includes six types of services to meet parent/family needs, organized as a continuum from fundamental information/education services, to those supporting parents to deliver services to meet their child's needs, to a variety of services addressing parents' own needs (support groups, psychosocial services and service coordination). The framework provides pediatric rehabilitation service organizations with a way to consider different possible family-oriented services. Implications include the particular importance of providing information resources, support groups and psychosocial services to meet parents' needs, enhance capacity and promote family wellness. There is also an opportunity to provide composite parentâ€“child services to address the needs of both parents and children.

Method: Thirty- four school-refusing children (aged 5 to 15 years) were randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral treatment condition or a waiting-list control condition. Treatment consisted of individual child cognitive-behavioral therapy plus parent/teacher training in child behavior management skills. Measures taken before and after treatment included school attendance, child self-report of emotional distress and coping, caregiver reports on emotional and behavioral problems, and clinician ratings of global functioning. Results: Relative to waiting-list controls, children who received cognitive- behavioral therapy exhibited a significant improvement in school attendance. These children also improved on self-reports of fear, anxiety, depression, and coping. Significant improvements also occurred in relation to caregiver reports and clinician ratings. Maintenance of therapeutic gains was demonstrated at a 3-month follow-up assessment. Conclusions: Cognitive- behavioral treatment of school refusal was efficacious and acceptable. The relative contributions of child therapy and parent/teacher training require further study.","King N.J., Tonge B.J., Heyne D., Pritchard M., Rollings S., Young D., Myerson N., Ollendick T.H.",0,10.1097/00004583-199804000-00017,821
1078,Voluntary exercise increases resilience to social defeat stress in Syrian hamsters,"Exposure to social stressors can cause profound changes in an individual's well-being and can be an underlying factor in the etiology of a variety of psychopathologies, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In Syrian hamsters, a single social defeat experience results in behavioral changes collectively known as conditioned defeat (CD), and includes an abolishment of territorial aggression and the emergence of high levels of defensive behaviors. In contrast, voluntary exercise has been shown to promote stress resilience and can also have anxiolytic-like effects. Although several studies have investigated the resilience-inducing effects of voluntary exercise after exposure to physical stressors, such as restraint and electric shock, few studies have examined whether exercise can impart resilience in response to ethologically-based stressors, such as social defeat. In Experiment 1, we tested the hypothesis that voluntary exercise can have anxiolytic-like effects in socially defeated hamsters. In the elevated plus maze, the exercise group exhibited a significant reduction in risk assessment, a commonly used index of anxiety, compared to the no-exercise group. In the open-field test, animals in the exercise group exhibited a significant reduction in locomotor behavior and rearing, also an indication of an anxiolytic-like effect of exercise. In Experiment 2, we examined whether exercise can reverse the defeat-induced potentiation of defensive behaviors using the CD model. Socially defeated hamsters in the exercise group exhibited significantly lower levels of defensive/submissive behaviors compared to the no-exercise group upon exposure to the resident aggressor. Taken together, these results are among the first to suggest that voluntary exercise may promote resilience to social defeat stress in Syrian hamsters.

1079,Psychosocial benefits of three formats of a standardized behavioral stress management program,"OBJECTIVE: Psychosocial factors are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in healthy and clinical populations. Behavioral interventions are needed to train the large number of people in the community setting who are affected by stressors to use coping skills that will reduce these risk factors. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of three forms of delivery of a standardized, behavioral intervention-the Williams LifeSkills program-designed to reduce levels of psychosocial risk factors in nonclinical populations. METHODS: One hundred ninety-six participants screening positive for elevated psychosocial distress were randomized to either a waitlist control group or one of three intervention groups: the LifeSkills Workshop, the LifeSkills Video, or the LifeSkills Video and Workshop combined. Psychosocial risk factors were evaluated at baseline and at 10 days, 2 months, and 6 months after the training/wait period. RESULTS: At 10 days follow up, the workshop + video and video-only groups showed significant improvements over control subjects in trait anxiety and perceived stress. Moreover, the workshop + video group maintained benefit over control subjects throughout 6 months follow up in both of these measures, whereas the video-only group maintained benefit in trait anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Because the psychosocial well-being of two of the treated groups improved over that of the control group, it appears that the Williams LifeSkills program accelerates and maintains a normal return to low distress after a stressful time. This is the first study to show that a commercially available, facilitator- or self-administered behavioral training product can have significant beneficial effects on psychosocial well-being in a healthy community sample.

1081,Effects of a Stress-Management Program for Inpatients With Mental Disorders: A Feasibility Study,"Stress-management interventions have been integrated into treatments for people with mental disorders. Nevertheless, most studies on these interventions have been conducted on patients with schizophrenia in Western countries, and limited studies have used objective measurements of stress. We developed a group-based, four-session stress-management (S-Manage) program for people with mental disorders, consisting of two major components: psychoeducation and relaxation practice. This single-group, pretestâ€“posttest, quasi-experimental study was undertaken to test the initial effects and determine the effect sizes of the program. A convenience sample of 55 inpatients were recruited from a mental health ward at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Self-report questionnaires and physiological measures of stress (skin temperature and salivary immunoglobulin A [SIgA]) were used for data collection. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and repeated-measures analysis of variance. Most participants were Singaporean, female, single, and employed. Diagnoses included schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, and mixed diagnoses. All received standard care provided by the hospital. Participants had significant reductions in objective stress, measured by skin temperature (effect size = 0.54) and SIgA (effect size = 0.16), and subjective stress (effect size = 0.16) as well as improved psychological health (effect size = 0.40) in response to the intervention. This study provides preliminary evidence to support the positive effects of the S-Manage program on people with mental disorders. Future studies should further test the efficacy of the program using more rigorous methods such as randomized controlled trial and multicenter study.

1082,Mindfulness in Motion: a Mindfulness-Based Intervention to Reduce Stress and Enhance Quality of Sleep in Scandinavian Employees,"Worksite stress reduction interventions are utilized by employers to improve the health and productivity of their workers. Originally designed for the American workplace, Mindfulness in Motion (MIM) is a mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) that incorporates mindfulness, music, and yoga in a time-limited fashion. This study examined the effectiveness of the Danish translation of MIM and investigated the ability of MIM to reduce stress while enhancing quality of sleep and work engagement in bank employees of a non-American culture. In a randomized controlled trial in Copenhagen, Denmark, participants were assigned to the worksite MIM stress reduction program or were wait-listed to the control group. The intervention group (n = 27) received 8Â weeks of MIM (60Â min/week) via a trained instructor. The controls (n = 30) received no intervention during the study period. Participants were assessed at baseline, immediately following the intervention, and 8Â weeks post-intervention via the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Scale (PSQI), and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-9 (UWES-9). While there was no significant improvement in overall work engagement, the MIM group achieved significant reductions in stress (p < 0.001), improvements in global sleep (p = 0.005), subjective sleep quality (p = 0.007), and daytime dysfunction (p = 0.004) and trended toward improvement in the subscale of work absorption (p = 0.05). These improvements were maintained at least 8Â weeks after the completion of the program. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the cross-cultural translation of MIM as an effective MBI that can be generalizable to populations outside the American worksite.

1083,Mindfulness in Motion (MIM): An Onsite Mindfulness Based Intervention (MBI) for Chronically High Stress Work Environments to Increase Resiliency and Work Engagement,"A pragmatic mindfulness intervention to benefit personnel working in chronically high-stress environments, delivered onsite during the workday, is timely and valuable to employee and employer alike. Mindfulness in Motion (MIM) is a Mindfulness Based Intervention (MBI) offered as a modified, less time intensive method (compared to Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction), delivered onsite, during work, and intends to enable busy working adults to experience the benefits of mindfulness. It teaches mindful awareness principles, rehearses mindfulness as a group, emphasizes the use of gentle yoga stretches, and utilizes relaxing music in the background of both the group sessions and individual mindfulness practice. MIM is delivered in a group format, for 1 hr/week/8 weeks. CDs and a DVD are provided to facilitate individual practice. The yoga movement is emphasized in the protocol to facilitate a quieting of the mind. The music is included for participants to associate the relaxed state experienced in the group session with their individual practice. To determine the intervention feasibility/efficacy we conducted a randomized wait-list control group in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). ICUs represent a high-stress work environment where personnel experience chronic exposure to catastrophic situations as they care for seriously injured/ill patients. Despite high levels of work-related stress, few interventions have been developed and delivered onsite for such environments. The intervention is delivered on site in the ICU, during work hours, with participants receiving time release to attend sessions. The intervention is well received with 97% retention rate. Work engagement and resiliency increase significantly in the intervention group, compared to the wait-list control group, while participant respiration rates decrease significantly pre-post in 6/8 of the weekly sessions. Participants value institutional support, relaxing music, and the instructor as pivotal to program success. This provides evidence that MIM is feasible, well accepted, and can be effectively implemented in a chronically high-stress work environment.","Klatt, M; Steinberg, B; Duchemin, AM",1,10.3791/52359,826
1084,Sex differences in heart rate responses to script-driven imagery soon after trauma and risk of posttraumatic stress disorder,"Objective: To investigate in trauma survivors the predictive validity of heightened physiological responsivity to script-driven imagery for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and to evaluate the interactive effect of survivors' sex. Physiological responses to idiosyncratic trauma reminders may be predictive of later PTSD. The majority of previous studies have been cross sectional and have produced mixed findings. Sex differences may contribute to this heterogeneity. Methods: Heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia were measured at 2 weeks post trauma in 158 assault survivors during baseline and as they listened to an idiosyncratic trauma script. At 6 months, 15.2% of male and 28.1% of female participants met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Results: Generalized linear model and logistic regression analyses showed that HR response to script-driven imagery and sex interacted in predicting PTSD symptom severity at 6 months. Women had greater PTSD symptom severities overall. Female HR responders to script-driven imagery showed the highest PTSD symptom severities and were almost three times more likely to develop PTSD at 6 months compared with men and female nonresponders (odds ratio, 2.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-6.57). Respiratory sinus arrhythmia responder type did not predict PTSD (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-1.33). Conclusion: Female trauma survivors who respond to trauma reminders with increased HR may be at particular risk of developing PTSD. Physiological reactivity to trauma cues may be a useful index for screening and prevention of PTSD.

1085,Posttraumatic stress and depressive symptoms among people living with HIV in the Gambia,"This study aimed to assess the prevalence and clinical and psychosocial correlates of psychiatric symptoms in a sample of HIV patients in the Gambia. Data from 44 HIV-positive outpatients were collected at a Genito-Urinary Medicine clinic in Fajara, the Gambia. Translated versions of the Impact of Event Scale Revised and the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Short Depression Scale were used to assess posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and depressive symptoms, respectively. The Pictorial Representation of Illness and Self Measure revised was used to assess illness perception (IP). All other data (e.g., CD4 counts) were retrieved from medical charts or through standardised questions. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms (43.2%) and depressive symptoms (40.9%) was high. Not having an independent income and having a CD4 count under 200 cells/l were independent correlates of depressive symptoms. Only IP was an independent correlate of PTSD symptoms. Finally, IP tended to moderate the relationship between CD4 cell counts and depressive symptoms. These findings indicate that routine screening for psychiatric symptoms is both necessary and feasible among HIV patients in the Gambia. In addition, any intervention targeting these symptoms should take IP into account. Â© 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Klis S., Velding K., Gidron Y., Peterson K.",0,10.1080/09540121.2010.507756,828
1087,"Psychological Injuries: Forensic Assessment, Treatment, and Law","Human emotional suffering has been studied for centuries, but the significance of psychological injuries within legal contexts has only recently been recognized. As the public becomes increasingly aware of the ways in which mental health affects physical"" and financial"" well-being, psychological injuries comprise a rapidly growing set of personal injury insurance claims. Although the problems that people claim to suffer from are serious and often genuine, the largely subjective and unobservable nature of psychological conditions has led to much skepticism about the authenticity of psychological injury claims. Improved assessment methods and research on the economic and physical health consequences of psychological distress has resulted in exponential growth in the litigation related to such conditions. Integrating the history of psychological injuries both from legal and mental health perspectives, this book offers discussions of relevant statutory and case law. Focusing especially on post-traumatic stress disorder, it addresses the current status and empirical limitations of forensic assessments of psychological injuries and alerts to common vulnerabilities in expert evidence from mental health professionals. In addition, it also uses empirical research to provide the best forensic methods for assessing both clinical conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and for alternative explanations such as malingering.

1088,Empirical limits for the forensic assessment of PTSD litigants,"This paper discusses the limits of expert opinion on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in personal injury claims. The construct of PTSD is hampered by several empirical limitations. Multiple reliable measures of PTSD exist, but have not been evaluated sufficiently within litigating samples and are infrequently used by forensic assessors. Common methods for trauma screening appear insensitive. Opinions about causation of PTSD and disability are complicated by retrospective memory biases, as well as the failure of most anxiety disorders to be detected within primary medical care. PTSD appears to have a steep spontaneous remission curve during the first year, but at least 10% of trauma-exposed people suffer chronic distress. Little is known about the course beyond 1 year. Efficacious psychological treatments have been developed for PTSD, but are not in common use limiting claimants' access to rehabilitative treatments. Research on functional disability associated with PTSD is in its infancy, but it seems likely that PTSD will account for only a part of the variance in work disability. We provide suggestions for improving forensic practice, advising the courts about the limitations of forensic opinions, and necessary research.

1089,Post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiometabolic disease: Improving causal inference to inform practice,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been declared 'a life sentence' based on evidence that the disorder leads to a host of physical health problems. Some of the strongest empirical research - in terms of methodology and findings - has shown that PTSD predicts higher risk of cardiometabolic diseases, specifically cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite mounting evidence, PTSD is not currently acknowledged as a risk factor by cardiovascular or endocrinological medicine. This view is unlikely to change absent compelling evidence that PTSD causally contributes to cardiometabolic disease. This review suggests that with developments in methods for epidemiological research and the rapidly expanding knowledge of the behavioral and biological effects of PTSD the field is poised to provide more definitive answers to questions of causality. First, we discuss methods to improve causal inference using the observational data most often used in studies of PTSD and health, with particular reference to issues of temporality and confounding. Second, we consider recent work linking PTSD with specific behaviors and biological processes, and evaluate whether these may plausibly serve as mechanisms by which PTSD leads to cardiometabolic disease. Third, we evaluate how looking more comprehensively into the PTSD phenotype provides insight into whether specific aspects of PTSD phenomenology are particularly relevant to cardiometabolic disease. Finally, we discuss new areas of research that are feasible and could enhance understanding of the PTSD-cardiometabolic relationship, such as testing whether treatment of PTSD can halt or even reverse the cardiometabolic risk factors causally related to CVD and T2D.

1090,Depression and resting state heart rate variability in children and adolescents â€” A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Among adults, depression is associated with reduced vagal activity, as indexed by high frequency heart rate variability [HF-HRV]), which correlates inversely with depression severity. Available evidence in depressed children and adolescents remains to be reviewed systematically. A search of the literature was performed to identify studies reporting (i) HF-HRV in clinically depressed children/adolescents relative to controls (kÂ =Â 4, nÂ =Â 259) and (ii) the association between HF-HRV and depressive symptoms as measured by standardized psychometric instruments in children and adolescents (kÂ =Â 6, nÂ =Â 2625).

While no correlation between HF-HRV and depressive symptom severity was observed (rÂ =Â âˆ’.041 [âˆ’Â 0.143; 0.062]), these additional correlational findings are limited to non-clinical samples. Findings have important clinical implications including a potentially increased risk for future physical ill health and also the identification of potential new treatment targets in child and adolescent depression.

1091,Effects of a stress management program on vital exhaustion and depression in women with coronary heart disease: A randomized controlled intervention study,"Objectives. Psychosocial factors, including depression and vital exhaustion (VE) are associated with adverse outcome in coronary heart disease (CHD). Women with CHD are poor responders to psychosocial treatment and knowledge regarding which treatment modality works in them is limited. This randomized controlled clinical study evaluated the effect of a 1-year stress management program, aimed at reducing symptoms of depression and VE in CHD women. Design. Patients were 247 women, â‰¤75 years, recruited consecutively after a cardiac event and randomly assigned to either stress management (20 2-h sessions) and medical care by a cardiologist, or to obtaining usual health care as controls. Measurements at; baseline (6-8 weeks after randomization), 10 weeks (after 10 intervention sessions), 1 year (end of intervention) and 1-2 years follow-up. Results. For VE, intention to treat analysis showed effects for time (P < 0.001) and time Ã— treatment interaction (P = 0.005), reflecting that both groups improved over time, and that the decrease of VE was more pronounced in the intervention group. However, the level of VE was higher in the intervention group than amongst controls at baseline, 22.7 vs. 19.4 (P = 0.036) but it did not differ later. The change in depressive symptoms did not differ between the groups. Conclusions. CHD women attending our program experienced a more pronounced decrease in VE than controls. However, as they had higher baseline levels, due to regression towards the mean we cannot attribute the decrease in VE to the intervention. Whether the program has long-term beneficial effects needs to be evaluated.

1092,Cannabinoids in health and disease,"Cannabis sativa L. preparations have been used in medicine for millenia. However, concern over the dangers of abuse led to the banning of the medicinal use of marijuana in most countries in the 1930s. Only recently, marijuana and individual natural and synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists, as well as chemically related compounds, whose mechanism of action is still obscure, have come back to being considered of therapeutic value. However, their use is highly restricted. Despite the mild addiction to cannabis and the possible enhancement of addiction to other substances of abuse, when combined with cannabis, the therapeutic value of cannabinoids is too high to be put aside. Numerous diseases, such as anorexia, emesis, pain, inflammation, multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease), epilepsy, glaucoma, osteoporosis, schizophrenia, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, obesity, and metabolic syndrome-related disorders, to name just a few, are being treated or have the potential to be treated by cannabinoid agonists/antagonists/ cannabinoid-related compounds. In view of the very low toxicity and the generally benign side effects of this group of compounds, neglecting or denying their clinical potential is unacceptable - instead, we need to work on the development of more selective cannabinoid receptor agonists/antagonists and related compounds, as well as on novel drugs of this family with better selectivity, distribution patterns, and pharmacokinetics, and - in cases where it is impossible to separate the desired clinical action and the psychoactivity - just to monitor these side effects carefully.

To assess their experiences of the services and the perceived effects of working, two IPS and two Vocational Service clients at each centre who had found work during the study period were interviewed, along with two IPS and two Vocational Service clients at each centre who had not. Results: IPS clients reported having received more help seeking and maintaining employment, whereas Vocational Service clients reported having received more help in finding sheltered employment or placements. Clients who had worked associated this with financial stability, improved social lives, increased self-esteem, integration into society and amelioration of their symptoms, as well as reduced feelings of boredom and isolation, but also reported increased levels of stress. IPS clients as well as Vocational Service ones reported not receiving enough follow-up support, despite this being proposed as a key feature of the model. Conclusion: Findings from the in-depth interviews reflect differences in service models that have also been tested quantitatively but further work in disaggregating the IPS model and assessing the impact of each component would be valuable.

1096,Implementation of a stress management program in outpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A randomized controlled trial,"Objective: Although there is scientific evidence that stress adversely affects metabolic control, only a few studies have examined the role of stress management in improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). In this study, we investigated the effect of a relaxation technique on levels of stress and glycemic control. Design: A total of 53 patients with type 2 DM were randomly assigned to undergo either an 8-week stress management program, consisting of 10 min of diaphragmatic breathing and 15 min of progressive muscle relaxation twice per day (n=25, intervention group), or not (n=28, control group). Perceived stress, health locus of control and HbA1c were primary outcomes and were measured before and after intervention. Results: In the intervention group, perceived stress score (PSS) and HbA1c had decreased significantly (P<0.05) by the end of the program. Specifically concerning the PSS, the higher the initial levels of perceived stress the greater the benefit of the intervention. No other significant changes were found. Conclusions: Our results show a beneficial role of stress management for patients with type 2 DM, as regards both stress levels and glycemic control. It is recommended to consider this type of treatment as an adjunct to conventional therapy. We deem that our study could encourage future studies in this area with larger samples, longer duration and more objective measurements. Â© 2014 Hellenic Endocrine Society.

1097,Effects of a stress-management program on injury and stress of competitive gymnasts,"20 competitive gymnasts (17 girls, 3 boys; mean age, 14.4 +/- 3.4 yr.) were recruited from two clubs in Auckland, New Zealand. Gymnasts, who had competed at a national or international level, were divided into two groups to examine the effects of a longitudinal stress-managenlent program on injury and stress. Those in the stress-management group took part in 12 1-hr. sessions over 24 weeks, while the control group took part in a placebo program of anthropometric measurements and lectures on nutrition. All participants completed the Life Experiences Survey and Athletic Experiences Survey at baseline, 3 me., 6 mo. (end of intervention), and 9 me. (3 me. after completion of intervention). Injury data were collected prospectively by weekly self-report over the 9-mo. study. Repeated-measures analyses of covariance with age and, where applicable, the baseline measure of the dependent variable entered as covariates, indicated no significant group or group by time effects for the scores on the two surveys, or injury scores. However, given the small sample, the statistical power of the study to detect even large effects was low. Therefore, rather than concluding that the stress-management program had no effect on training hours lost to injury or on stress, upper limits were placed on the magnitude of any effects that might exist. Further research using larger samples is recommended.","Kolt, GS; Hume, PA",0,10.2466/PMS.99.4.195-207,838
1098,Cost-of-illness studies and cost-effectiveness analyses in anxiety disorders: A systematic review,"Aims: To review cost-of-illness studies (COI) and cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) conducted for anxiety disorders. Methods: Based on a database search in Pubmed, PsychINFO and NHS EED, studies were classified according to various criteria. Cost data were inflated and converted to 2005 US-$ purchasing power parities (PPP). Results: We finally identified 20 COI and 11 CEA of which most concentrated on panic disorder (PD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Differing inclusion of cost categories limited comparability of COI. PD and GAD tended to show higher direct costs per case, but lower direct cost per inhabitant than social and specific phobias. Different measures of effectiveness severely limited comparability of CEA. Overall CEA analysed 26 therapeutic or interventional strategies mostly compared to standard treatment, 8 of them resulting in lower better effectiveness and costs than the comparator. Conclusions: Anxiety disorders cause considerable costs. More research on phobias, more standardised inclusion of cost categories in COI and a wider use of comparable effectiveness measures (like QALYs) in CEA is needed. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

1099,Tackling Psychosocial Risks and Work-Related Stress in Developing Countries: The Need for a Multilevel Intervention Framework,"This exploratory study aimed to provide a framework for raising awareness and tackling emerging psychosocial risks in developing countries. We considered regulation, working conditions, hazardous sectors, health impact, vulnerable workers, and multilevel interventions while recognizing existing challenges and barriers. We used a triangulated methodological approach where each stage provided the basis for the development of the next. Semi-structured expert interviews informed the development of a two-round Delphi survey to build consensus, followed by a series of focus groups to explore findings in-depth. A total of 121 experts participated across all research stages. This article concentrates on the last stage of the research, the focus groups, while making reference to the findings of the first two research stages. Results for developing countries indicate that occupational health and safety priorities have changed during the last decade and point to the need for a comprehensive framework for action, for monitoring psychosocial risks and addressing work-related stress, violence, harassment, and unhealthy behaviors. Attention to socioeconomic conditions and processes of globalization, and an extended research and action paradigm, different from that applied in industrialized countries, are required. There is lack of research, infrastructure, information, and motivation by policymakers to act and a pressing need for capacity building, stakeholder mobilization, and international exchange and collaboration. Developing countries are not spared from the health, economic, and societal impact of psychosocial risks and work-related stress and this article outlines a framework for concerted action at different levels.","Kortum, E; Leka, S",0,10.1037/a0035033,840
1100,Expressive writing and wound healing in older adults: A randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether expressive writing could speed wound reepithelialization in healthy, older adults. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 49 healthy older adults aged 64 to 97 years were assigned to write for 20 minutes a day either about upsetting life events (Expressive Writing) or about daily activities (Time Management) for 3 consecutive days. Two weeks postwriting, 4-mm punch biopsy wounds were created on the inner, upper arm. Wounds were photographed routinely for 21 days to monitor wound reepithelialization. Perceived stress, depressive symptoms, health-related behaviors, number of doctor visits, and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated proinflammatory cytokine production were also measured throughout the study. RESULTS: Participants in the Expressive Writing group had a greater proportion of fully reepithelialized wounds at Day 11 postbiopsy compared with the Time Management group, with 76.2% versus 42.1% healed, Ï‡(1, n = 40) = 4.83, p = .028. Ordinal logistic regression showed more sleep in the week before wounding also predicted faster healing wounds. There were no significant group differences in changes to perceived stress, depressive symptoms, health-related behaviors, lipopolysaccharide-induced proinflammatory cytokine production, or number of doctor visits over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends previous research by showing that expressive writing can improve wound healing in older adults and women. Future research is needed to better understand the underlying cognitive, psychosocial, and biological mechanisms contributing to improved wound healing from these simple, yet effective, writing exercises.

1101,Emotional Plasticity: Conditions and Effects of Improving Emotional Competence in Adulthood,"This study aimed to investigate (a) whether it is possible to increase emotional competence (EC) in adulthood; (b) whether this improvement results in better mental, physical, and social adjustment; (c) whether this improvement can be maintained 1 year later; and (d) whether these benefits are accompanied by a reduction in stress-hormone secretion (i.e., cortisol). One hundred and thirty-two participants were randomly assigned to an EC-enhancing intervention (in group format) or to a control group. Participants in the intervention group underwent a specifically designed 15-hr intervention targeting the 5 core emotional competencies, complemented with a 4-week e-mail follow-up. Results reveal that the level of emotional competencies increased significantly in the intervention group in contrast with the control group. This increase resulted in lower cortisol secretion, enhanced subjective and physical well-being, as well as improved quality of social and marital relationships in the intervention group. No significant change occurred in the control group. Peer reports on EC and quality of relationships confirmed these results. These data suggest that emotional competencies can be improved, with effective benefits on personal and interpersonal functioning lasting for at least 1 year. The theoretical implications of these results as well as their practical implications for the construction and the development of effective emotional competencies interventions are discussed.

1102,Can a brief antepartum preventive group intervention help reduce postpartum depressive symptomatology?,"Background: Psychosocial and psychological interventions are generally effective in reducing depressive symptomatology in the postpartum period. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief preventive group intervention for postpartum depression (PPD) in a naturalistic setting, and study the effect of this on social and psychological risk factors. Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial (n = 1,719) in south-eastern Hungary in 62 antepartum centers. Pregnant women (n = 710) underwent a 4-session preventive group intervention whereas a control group (n = 1,009) attended 4 sessions providing the same information given in usual care. Results: Our intervention appeared to significantly reduce the risk of PPD, as defined by Leverton Questionnaire total scores (OR = 0.69). It resulted in an absolute risk reduction of about 18% in those with antepartum depression and 0.5% in those with no depression at recruitment. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a much reduced risk in those with a perceived lack of partner support (OR = 0.4) in the treatment group. Unplanned pregnancy, an irreversible risk factor affecting every fifth woman, also seemed to have a reduced effect on PPD after our group intervention (OR = 0.81). Conclusions: A brief preventive antepartum group intervention focusing on psychoeducation, stress management, improving coping mechanisms, and the development of social support can be effective in reducing postpartum depressive symptomatology.

Methods: Perceived stress, workplace wellbeing, and engagement were measured at baseline and within 1 week of the SRP completion, and contemporaneously 6 weeks apart for a waitlist control group. A second program was implemented to examine reproducibility of results. Results: Fifty participants undertook the SRPs, and 29 participants were waitlisted. A significant improvement in distress, workplace wellbeing, and vigor was observed within the first SRP group, when compared with the control group. The improvement in distress and wellbeing was reproduced in the second SRP group. Conclusions: This study adds to the growing body of research that mindfulness may be an effective method for reducing workplace stress, improving employee wellbeing, and enhancing work engagement.

1104,"'Learn young, learn fair', a stress management program for fifth and sixth graders: Longitudinal results from an experimental study","Background: This study examined the effects of a universal stress management program (Learn Young, Learn Fair) on stress, coping, anxiety and depression in fifth and sixth grade children. Methods: Fifty-two schools (1467 children) participated in a clustered randomized controlled trial. Data was collected in the fall of 2002, the spring of 2003, and the winter of 2004. Given the nested structure of the design mixed (multilevel) regression analyses were applied. Results: Positive effects were found for emotion-focused coping at posttest (p <.01) and increased stress awareness at both time points. At posttest a decrease in problem solving was found (p <.01). After correcting for mediation by stress awareness the results showed that the program significantly reduced stress symptoms (p =.05) and anxiety (p =.01) at posttest. Effect sizes varied from small to large. Conclusions: Universal prevention programs that address stress and coping in children are warranted given the high prevalence of stress in children and the relationship between stress, on the one hand, and health complaints and pathology, on the other. Such programs are expected to be particularly salient for children with an increased sensitivity to stress and inadequate coping styles (e.g., diathesis-stress model). The results indicate that the school-based program 'Learn Young, Learn Fair' may be a valuable program for reducing stress in children.

1105,"Process evaluation of 'Learn Young, Learn Fair' - A stress management programme for 5th and 6th graders","This article describes the process evaluation of a stress management program called 'Learn Young, Learn Fair' for 5th and 6th graders. Studies, reviews and meta-analyses of prevention programs report that a common limitation in studies is the restricted documentation of process factors that contribute to the success of interventions. Program implementation is such a factor and findings indicate that the quality of implementation significantly affects outcomes. It is associated with Type III error: no effect is established because the program itself is inadequately designed or delivered. The potential role for school psychologists in process evaluation is discussed, and the great deal Intervention Mapping has to offer in this respect. A questionnaire for both teachers and pupils was developed, with items formulated to assess implementation and to investigate whether teachers and pupils valued the program. The latter would give an indication of future adoption and implementation in the field. Implementation was divided into completeness and fidelity. Completeness for the main parts of the program, the lessons and homework assignments, was good (98.5 and 95.8 percent respectively). Completeness for the auxiliary components, the booster sessions and the daily practice exercises, was moderate (62.2 and 69.3 percent respectively). Fidelity was good; mostly the teacher implemented the lessons, almost all items were discussed, and the manual was quite strictly followed (94, 98 and 95 percent respectively). Implementation of the program was of good quality. The program was delivered as intended. Effect evaluation will not be threatened by a Type III error. The results of this study favoured the feasibility of program implementation. It is stated that school psychologists can use the findings as a criterion for program selection. In that case it will be an example of the process of enlarging the potential role of school psychology in process evaluation of mental health interventions for schools.","Kraag, G; van Breukelena, G; Lamberts, P; Vugts, O; Kok, G; Fekkes, M; Abu-Saad, HH",0,10.1177/0143034307078100,846
1106,School programs targeting stress management in children and adolescents: A meta-analysis,"Introduction: This meta-analysis evaluates the effect of school programs targeting stress management or coping skills in school children. Methods: Articles were selected through a systematic literature search. Only randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies were included. The standardized mean differences (SMDs) between baseline and final measures were computed for experimental and control groups. Experimental groups were groups that either received an intervention of (a) relaxation training, (b) social problem solving, (c) social adjustment and emotional self-control, or (d) a combination of these interventions. If no baseline measurement was available, SMDs were calculated between final measures of the groups. The overall pooled effect size was calculated and the pooled effect sizes of improvement on stress, coping, (social) behavior, and self-efficacy by random effects meta-analysis. The dependence of the results on study characteristics (i.e. methodological quality and type of intervention) was evaluated using meta-regression analysis. Results: Nineteen publications met the inclusion criteria of controlled trials for class programs, teaching coping skills or stress management. Overall effect size for the programs was -1.51 [95% confidence interval (CI) -2.29, -0.73], indicating a positive effect. However, heterogeneity was significant (p <.001). Sensitivity analyses showed that study quality and type of intervention were sources of heterogeneity influencing the overall result (p values <.001). The heterogeneity in quality may be associated with methodological diversity and differences in outcome assessments, rather than variety in treatment effect. Effect was calculated per intervention type, and positive effects were found for stress symptoms with a pooled effect size of -0.865 (95% CI: -1.229, -0.502) and for coping with a pooled effect size of -3.493 (95% CI: -6.711, -0.275). Conclusion: It is tentatively concluded that school programs targeting stress management or coping skills are effective in reducing stress symptoms and enhancing coping skills. Future research should use clear quality criteria and strive for less diversity in methodology and outcome assessment. (c) 2006 Society for the Study of School Psychology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

1107,Sun Safety at Work Canada: a multiple case-study protocol to develop sun safety and heat protection programs and policies for outdoor workers,"Background: CAREX Canada has identified solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) as the second most prominent carcinogenic exposure in Canada, and over 75 % of Canadian outdoor workers fall within the highest exposure category. Heat stress also presents an important public health issue, particularly for outdoor workers. The most serious form of heat stress is heat stroke, which can cause irreversible damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver. Although the need for sun and heat protection has been identified, there is no Canada-wide heat and sun safety program for outdoor workers. Further, no prevention programs have addressed both skin cancer prevention and heat stress in an integrated approach. The aim of this partnered study is to evaluate whether a multi-implementation, multi-evaluation approach can help develop sustainable workplace-specific programs, policies, and procedures to increase the use of UV safety and heat protection.Methods/design: This 2-year study is a theory-driven, multi-site, non-randomized study design with a cross-case analysis of 13 workplaces across four provinces in Canada. The first phase of the study includes the development of workplace-specific programs with the support of the intensive engagement of knowledge brokers. There will be a three-points-in-time evaluation with process and impact components involving the occupational health and safety (OHS) director, management, and workers with the goal of measuring changes in workplace policies, procedures, and practices. It will use mixed methods involving semi-structured key informant interviews, focus groups, surveys, site observations, and UV dosimetry assessment. Using the findings from phase I, in phase 2, a web-based, interactive, intervention planning tool for workplaces will be developed, as will the intensive engagement of intermediaries such as industry decision-makers to link to policymakers about the importance of heat and sun safety for outdoor workers.Discussion: Solar UV and heat are both health and safety hazards. Using an occupational health and safety risk assessment and control framework, Sun Safety at Work Canada will support workplaces to assess their exposure risks, implement control strategies that build on their existing programs, and embed the controls into their existing occupational health and safety system.","Kramer, Desre M.; Tenkate, Thomas; Strahlendorf, Peter; Kushner, Rivka; Gardner, Audrey; Holness, D.

1109,Effects of psychological and social factors on organic disease: A critical assessment of research on coronary heart disease,"An extensive research literature in the behavioral sciences and medicine suggests that psychological and social factors may play a direct role in organic coronary artery disease (CAD) pathology. However, many in the medical and scientific community regard this evidence with skepticism. This chapter critically examines research on the impact of psychological and psychosocial factors on the development and outcome of coronary heart disease, with particular emphasis on studies employing verifiable outcomes of CAD morbidity or mortality. Five key variables identified as possible psychosocial risk factors for CAD are addressed: acute and chronic stress, hostility, depression, social support, and socioeconomic status. Evidence regarding the efficacy of psychosocial interventions is also presented. It is suggested that, taken as a whole, evidence for a psychological and social impact on CAD morbidity and mortality is convincing. However, continued progress in this area requires multidisciplinary research integrating expertise in cardiology and the behavioral sciences, and more effective efforts to communicate research findings to a biomedical audience.","Krantz D.S., McCeney M.K.",0,10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135208,849
1110,Design and baseline characteristics of the PerfectFit study: a multicenter cluster-randomized trial of a lifestyle intervention in employees with increased cardiovascular risk,"Background: The prevalence of unhealthy lifestyles and preventable chronic diseases is high. They lead to disabilities and sickness absence, which might be reduced if health promotion measures were applied. Therefore, we developed the PerfectFit health promotion intervention with a ""blended care""-approach, which consists of a web-based health risk assessment (HRA) including tailored and personalized advice, followed by motivational interviewing (MI). We hypothesize that adding MI to a web-based HRA leads to better health outcomes. The objective is to describe the design and baseline characteristics of the PerfectFit study, which is being conducted among employees with high cardiovascular risk in the military workforce, the police organization and an academic hospital.Methods: PerfectFit is a cluster randomized controlled trial, consisting of two arms. Based on cardiovascular risk profiling, done between 2012 and 2014, we included employees based on one or more risk factors and motivation to participate. One arm is the 'limited' health program (control) that consists of: (a) an HRA as a decision aid for lifestyle changes, including tailored and personalized advice, and pros and cons of the options, and (b) a newsletter every 3 months. The other arm is the 'extensive' program (intervention), which is additionally offered MI-sessions by trained occupational physicians, 4 face-to-face and 3 by telephone, and is offered more choices of health promotion activities in the HRA. During the follow-up period, participants choose the health promotion activities they personally prefer. After six and twelve months, outcomes will be assessed by online questionnaires. After twelve months the cardiovascular risk profiling will be repeated. The primary outcome is self-reported general health. Secondary outcomes are self-reported work ability, CVD-risk score, sickness absence, productivity loss at work, participation in health promotion activities, changes in lifestyle (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, stress management) and body mass index. Furthermore, a process evaluation and an economic analysis will be performed.Discussion: Additional coaching using MI is expected to be a key factor for success of the web-based HRA in employees with increased cardiovascular risk. This ""blended care""-approach may be an essential strategy for effective health promotion activities.","Kouwenhoven-Pasmooij, Tessa A.; Djikanovic, Bosiljka; Robroek, Suzan J.

1113,Integrative psychotherapy for children and adolescents: A practice-oriented literature review,"This article provides a systematic review of the literature on psychotherapy integration for children and adolescents. Identified integrative treatments are categorized as broad integrative paradigms, which offer a nuanced approach to case conceptualization and intervention selection by drawing from multiple perspectives, and integrative treatment protocols, which offer systematized child treatment programs often for specific child disorders. Additionally, 4 integrative trends in primarily cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT) child and adolescent treatment are highlighted: assimilative integration in many CBT protocols, a movement toward ""systemic CBT"" that represents a more integrative approach, a trend to recognize and identify common factors across evidence-based treatments, and emergence of research on mechanisms of change. Psychotherapy integration is central to child treatment, although at times it is not clearly identified or developed both in the research literature and in practice. Disseminating intentionally integrative treatment approaches for children, with respectful attention to the literatures from which these approaches originate, will yield not only richer practice of treatments with an existing evidence base, but hopefully will also inspire more outcome and process research on child integrative treatments in the future.

1114,An Internet-Based Writing Intervention for PTSD in Veterans: A Feasibility and Pilot Effectiveness Trial,"Objective: Veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may avoid or fail to follow through with a full course of face-to-face mental health treatment for a variety of reasons. We conducted a pilot effectiveness trial of an online intervention for veterans with current PTSD to determine the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effectiveness of an online writing intervention (i.e., Warriors Internet Recovery and EDucation [WIRED]) as an adjunct to face-to-face psychotherapy. Method: Veterans (N=34) who had served in Iraq or Afghanistan with current PTSD subsequent to deployment-related trauma were randomized to Veterans Affairs (VA) mental health treatment as usual (TAU) or to treatment as usual plus the online intervention (TAU + WIRED). All research participants were recruited from the Trauma Services Program, VA Medical Center, Washington, DC. They completed baseline assessments as well as assessments 12 weeks and 24 weeks after the baseline assessment. The online intervention consisted of therapist-guided writing, using principles of prolonged exposure and cognitive therapy. The intervention was adapted from an evidence-based treatment used in The Netherlands and Germany for individuals who had been exposed to nonmilitary traumas. Results: In addition to showing that the online intervention was both feasible to develop and implement, as well as being safe, the results showed preliminary evidence of the effectiveness of the TAU WIRED intervention in this patient population, with particular evidence in reducing PTSD symptoms of hyperarousal. Conclusion: With minor modifications to enhance the therapeutic alliance, this intervention should be tested in a larger clinical trial to determine whether this method of online intervention might provide another alternative to face-to-face treatment for veterans with PTSD.

1115,"No effect of 5-day treatment with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) or the beta-blocker propranolol (inderal) on free cortisol responses to acute psychosocial stress: A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study","Background: The characterization of an individual's hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis stress response is a main research topic in neuropsychobiology since alterations have been causally linked to several disease states. Over the last years, several studies focused on the identification of sources of inter- and intraindividual variability, but there is still a paucity of experimental data on the effect of different pharmaceuticals on cortisol responses to acute psychological stress. Therefore, in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, we investigated the effect of treatment with two popular and clinically used pharmaceuticals on stress-related cortisol responses, namely acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), a known prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, and the beta-blocker propranolol (Inderal), a nonselective beta-receptor antagonist. Methods: For 5 days, 73 healthy subjects (50 men, 23 women; mean age 47.3 Â± 7.7 years) received either a daily oral dose of 100 mg aspirin, 80 mg propranolol (Inderal), aspirin + propranolol, or placebo. After treatment, subjects were confronted with the Trier Social Stress Test, a widely-used standardized psychosocial stress protocol. Cortisol responses were measured by six saliva samples taken before and after the stress exposure. Results: Subjects showed a significant cortisol increase after stress (p < 0.0001). The four treatment groups did not differ in their cortisol responses (group effect p > 0.44; interaction p > 0.97). Additionally, controlling for gender, age, smoking status, body mass index, mean arterial blood pressure or pre-stress cortisol levels yielded similar results in the total sample as well as in the male or female subgroups, respectively. Conclusion: Neither short-term treatment with aspirin nor propranolol altered the acute free cortisol response to psychological stress in healthy adults. Copyright Â© 2008 S.

With the help of the so-called silent room cabin concept, it was possible to induce a lunch-break relaxation opportunity that provided visual and territorial privacy. To evaluate the proposed effects, 14 call center agents were assigned to either 20 min progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) or small-talk (ST) break groups. We analyzed the data in a controlled trial for a period of 6 months (every 2 months four measurements a day at 12:00, 13:00, 16:00, 20:00) using independent observer and self-report ratings of emotional, mental, motivational, and physical strain. Results indicated that only the PMR break reduced postlunchtime and afternoon strain. Although further intervention research is required, our results suggest that PMR lunch break may sustainable reduce strain states in real worksite settings.

1117,Human models in acute and chronic stress: Assessing determinants of individual hypothalamuspituitaryadrenal axis activity and reactivity,"Stress is one of the most significant health problems in modern societies and the 21st century. This explains a pressing need for investigations into the biological pathways linking stress and health. Besides the locus coeruleusnoradrenaline/autonomic (sympathetic) nervous system (Chrousos and Gold 1992), the hypothalamuspituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis is the major physiological stress response system in the body. Since alterations in HPA axis regulation under basal conditions and in response to acute stress appear to be a close correlate or even a determining factor of the onset of different diseases or disease progression (Holsboer 1989; Chrousos and Gold 1992; Tsigos and Chrousos 1994, 2002; Stratakis and Chrousos 1995; McEwen 1998; Heim et al. 2000a; Raison and Miller 2003), the characterization of an individual's HPA axis activity as well as reactivity pattern to psychosocial stress appears to be of major interest. It is obvious that such a research agenda substantially depends on the availability of appropriate measures. However, since the HPA axis is a highly adaptive system which is characterized by marked inter-and intraindividual variability (Mason 1968; Hellhammer et al. 2009), the development of such markers of HPA axis regulation in humans wasand still isa rather challenging task. In this brief review, we focus on findings on two HPA axis measures, namely the cortisol-awakening response (CAR) to assess HPA axis basal activity and the Trier social stress test (TSST) to investigate HPA axis stress reactivity.

1118,Needs of Indian schizophrenia patients: An exploratory study from India,"Background: Although there are many studies from the West, no study has evaluated the needs of schizophrenia patients in Indian setting. Methodology: 100 consecutive patients of schizophrenia were assessed on Camberwell Assessment of Needs questionnaire. Same questionnaire was also administered to the caregiver to assess their perception about the needs of the patients. Results: Patients and their caregivers reported 8.12 and 7.13 needs, respectively, more than two-third of which were unmet. The most commonly reported needs by both patients and their caregivers were need for welfare benefits. Besides the welfare benefits, the four most common areas in which patients had needs and required help were-psychotic symptoms, psychological distress, information about the condition and money, whereas four most commonly reported area of needs reported by the caregivers were psychological distress, money, company and intimate relationships. Help provided by the government or non-governmental organizations was negligible. Conclusions: Most of needs of schizophrenia patients are unmet.

1120,Prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress disorder among victims of violence applying for state compensation,"Many studies have focused on the predictive value of victims' emotions experienced shortly after violence exposure to identify those vulnerable for development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, many victims remain unidentified during the initial recovery phase, yet may still be highly in need of psychological help after substantial time since victimization has passed. Professionals involved in the settlement of civil damage claims filed by victims of violence may play an important role in referring victims with current psychological problems to appropriate treatment services, as they are likely to maintain relations with victims until all compensation possibilities have been exhausted. As an exploratory examination of this topic, the current study investigates the potential utility of file characteristics as predictors of chronic PTSD among 686 victims of violence who had applied for state compensation with the Dutch Victim Compensation Fund (DVCF) in 2006. Identification of significant predictors is preceded by estimating prevalence rates of PTSD. Results indicate that approximately 1 of 2 victims applying for state compensation in the Netherlands still have PTSD many years after victimization and claim settlement. Age, female sex, time since victimization, acquaintance with the perpetrator, violence-related hospitalization, and compensation for immaterial damage prove to be predictive of PTSD, although female sex and immaterial damage compensation fail to reach significance after adjusting for recalled peritraumatic distress severity. Implications for policy practice as well as strengths and limitations of the study are discussed. Â© The Author(s) 2010.","Kunst M., Winkel F.W., Bogaerts S.",0,10.1177/0886260509354591,857
1121,Type D personality and posttraumatic stress disorder in victims of violence: A cross-sectional exploration,"The current study explored the relationship between type D personality and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among victims of violence (n = 189). The basic premise underlying the type D concept is that it is not the experience of negative emotions per se that renders individuals at risk of maladjustment in the face of adversity, but the way they are dealt with. Particularly the combination of high negative affectivity and social inhibition (i.e., the non-expression of emotions and inhibition of behaviours in social interactions) is assumed to be maladaptive. It was hypothesized that a high score on negative affectivity (i.e., above a pre-determined cut-off score) would only contribute to PTSD in the presence of a high score on social inhibition (also above a pre-determined cut-off score). Univariate results indicated that type D subjects (type Ds) reported higher PTSD symptom levels than those characterized by high negative affectivity/low social inhibition or low negative affectivity. Type Ds more often suffered from probable PTSD than non-type Ds. In multivariate analyses, type D personality was associated with an increased risk of probable PTSD above and beyond background variables, while high negative affectivity/low social inhibition was not. Results were discussed in light of victim support practices and study limitations. Copyright Â© 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Kunst M.J.J., Bogaerts S., Winkel F.W.",0,10.1002/cpp.698,858

Additionally, access to ASD-trained clinicians and research supported delivery options for families in rural areas is severely limited. COMPASS for Hope (C-HOPE) is an 8-week parent intervention program that was developed with the option of telehealth or face-to-face delivery. Parents who received C-HOPE intervention reported a reduction in parenting stress and an increase in competence. Parents also reported significant reductions in child behavior problems, both when compared to pre-intervention levels and to a waitlist control condition.

1124,Effectiveness of skin protection creams as a preventive measure in occupational dermatitis: a critical update according to criteria of evidence-based medicine,"Objectives: This study attempts to assess the evidence of the generally recommended three-step programme of skin protection in the prevention of occupational skin disease. Methods: The following clinical questions, representative of critical appraisal of this preventive measurement, were generated: (1) Can a skincare regimen effectively reduce or eliminate work-related poor skin conditions? (2) Do protective creams prevent harmful substances from penetrating and adhering to the skin? (3) Is the differentiation between pre-exposure and post-exposure products justified by reliable data? Answers were generated according to the method used in evidence-based medicine by searching the literature, critically appraising the results and applying the results to the clinical questions. For our search we decided to use PubMed as the most convenient access to Medline and because, in contrast to other databases, this access is available free of charge. Results: To investigate the efficacy of barrier creams as pre-exposure skin protectors various in vitro and in vivo test methods have been developed. Over the past years the test techniques have been improved in order to adopt a real workplace situation. Efforts for standardisation of evaluation criteria have been made, too. Nevertheless, there is a lack of placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trials evaluating the benefit of these products in the prevention of occupational contact dermatitis under real workplace conditions. The literature data are conflicting; some publications report on the positive aspects of skin protection, whereas others stress the negative ones. Conclusion: Not enough data have been accumulated for one to prove the benefit of skin protection measures under real workplace condition. Up to now, it is almost unclear if the various in vitro and in vivo methods used are suitable to simulate real workplace conditions and if these test results can be related to real occupational exposure. For the evidence-based recommendation of skin protection, further studies, especially under daily working conditions evaluating the contribution of each single element of skincare programme (products, frequency of application and education programme) are needed.","Kutting, B; Drexler, H",0,10.1007/s00420-003-0437-6,860
1127,Assessment of the efficacy of a stress management program for informal caregivers of dependent older adults,"Purpose: The majority of dependent older adults receive care at home from a family member. Caregiving places enormous demands on these caregivers and the negative consequences associated with caregiving are well documented. In this study we compared the effectiveness of two active interventions to a waiting-list control condition to improve emotional well-being in family caregivers. Design and Methods: We randomized distressed caregivers (N = 91) of physically impaired older adults to one of three conditions: traditional weekly sessions, minimal-therapist-contact sessions, or a waiting-list control group. These manual-guided interventions took place over a 2-month period. Results: Caregivers in the traditional weekly sessions experienced the highest reduction in depressive and anxious symptoms. Compared with control participants, caregivers in the traditional weekly sessions had lower posttreatment levels of depression and anxiety. They had also lower levels of depression than did caregivers in the minimal-therapist-contact intervention. Implications: These data suggest that traditional weekly sessions may be effective in reducing caregiver anxiety and depression. They further suggest that traditional weekly sessions are better than no intervention, and they are also better than a minimal-therapist-contact intervention.

The SHIELD program focused on improving diet, physical activity, body weight and sleep, and reducing the effects of unhealthy stress and behaviors, such as tobacco and substance abuse. The SHIELD team-based health promotion program was found to be feasible and effective at 6 months in improving diet, sleep, stress, and overall quality of life of law enforcement department personnel. Both intervention and control groups were followed for 24 months, and we report those durability findings, along with qualitative group interview results that provide insight into the changes of the long-term outcomes. Long-term effects were observed for consumption of fruits and vegetables, and there was some evidence for effects on tobacco and alcohol use. Assessment of dietary habits, physical activity behaviors, weight loss maintenance, and substance use is rare more than 1 year following an intervention, and in general, initial positive changes do not persist in prior research.

1130,"Child Sexual Abuse, Links to Later Sexual Exploitation/High-Risk Sexual Behavior, and Prevention/Treatment Programs","This paper reviews the literature on the nature and incidence of child sexual abuse, explores the link between child sexual abuse and later sexual exploitation, and reviews the literature on prevention strategies and effective interventions in child sexual abuse services. Our understanding of the international epidemiology of child sexual abuse is considerably greater than it was just 10 years ago, and studies from around the world are examined. Childhood sexual abuse can involve a wide number of psychological sequelae, including low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. Numerous studies have noted that child sexual abuse victims are vulnerable to later sexual revictimization, as well as the link between child sexual abuse and later engagement in high-risk sexual behaviour. Survivors of child sexual abuse are more likely to have multiple sex partners, become pregnant as teenagers, and experience sexual assault as adults. Various models which attempt to account for this inter-relationship are presented; most invoke mediating variables such as low self-esteem, drug/alcohol use, PTSD and distorted sexual development. Prevention strategies for child sexual abuse are examined including media campaigns, school-based prevention programmes, and therapy with abusers. The results of a number of meta-analyses are examined. However, researchers have identified significant methodological limitations in the extant research literature that impede the making of recommendations for implementing existing therapeutic programmes unreservedly.

1131,Continuous Pulse Oximetry and Capnography Monitoring for Postoperative Respiratory Depression and Adverse Events: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Death and anoxic brain injury from unrecognized postoperative respiratory depression (PORD) is a serious concern for patient safety. The American Patient Safety Foundation has called for continuous electronic monitoring for all patients receiving opioids in the postoperative period. These recommendations are based largely on consensus opinion with currently limited evidence. The objective of this study is to review the current state of knowledge on the effectiveness of continuous pulse oximetry (CPOX) versus routine nursing care and the effectiveness of continuous capnography monitoring with or without pulse oximetry for detecting PORD and preventing postoperative adverse events in the surgical ward.METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the literature databases published between 1946 and May 2017. We selected the studies that included the following: (1) adult surgical patients (> 18 years old); (2) prescribed opioids during the postoperative period; (3) monitored with CPOX and/or capnography; (4) primary outcome measures were oxygen desaturation, bradypnea, hypercarbia, rescue team activation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or mortality; and (5) studies published in the English language. Meta-analysis was performed using Cochrane Review Manager 5.3.RESULTS: In total, 9 studies (4 examining CPOX and 5 examining continuous capnography) were included in this systematic review. In the literature on CPOX, 1 randomized controlled trial showed no difference in ICU transfers (6.7% vs 8.5%; P =.33) or mortality (2.3% vs 2.2%). A prospective historical controlled trial demonstrated a significant reduction in ICU transfers (5.6-1.2 per 1000 patient days; P =.01) and rescue team activation (3.4-1.2 per 1000 patient days; P =.02) when CPOX was used. Overall, comparing the CPOX group versus the standard monitoring group, there was 34% risk reduction in ICU transfer (P =.06) and odds of recognizing desaturation (oxygen saturation [Spo(2)] < 90% > 1 hour) was 15 times higher (P <.00001). Pooled data from 3 capnography studies showed that continuous capnography group identified 8.6% more PORD events versus pulse oximetry monitoring group (CO2 group versus Spo(2) group: 11.5% vs 2.8%; P <.00001). The odds of recognizing PORD was almost 6 times higher in the capnography versus the pulse oximetry group (odds ratio: 5.83, 95% confidence interval, 3.54-9.63; P <.00001). No studies examined the impact of continuous capnography on reducing rescue team activation, ICU transfers, or mortality.CONCLUSIONS: The use of CPOX on the surgical ward is associated with significant improvement in the detection of oxygen desaturation versus intermittent nursing spot-checks. There is a trend toward less ICU transfers with CPOX versus standard monitoring. The evidence on whether the detection of oxygen desaturation leads to less rescue team activation and mortality is inconclusive. Capnography provides an early warning of PORD before oxygen desaturation, especially when supplemental oxygen is administered. Improved education regarding monitoring and further research with high-quality randomized controlled trials is needed.","Lam, Thach; Nagappa, Mahesh; Wong, Jean; Singh, Mandeep; Wong, David; Chung, Frances",0,10.1213/ANE.0000000000002557,865
1132,Trauma-focused therapy for refugees: Meta-analytic findings,"High levels of trauma-related psychological distress have been documented among ethnically diverse refugees. As the number of refugees worldwide continues to grow, determining the efficacy of established methods of trauma-focused therapy for this population is crucial. This meta-analysis examined the results of randomized controlled trials of psychotherapeutic intervention for traumatized adult refugees. Comparisons of 13 trauma-focused therapies to control groups from 12 studies were included in the analysis. The aggregate effect size for the primary outcome, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), was large in magnitude, Hedge's g = .91, p < .001, 95% CI [.56, 1.52]. The aggregate effect size for depression, assessed in 9 studies, was also large g = .63, p < .001, 95% CI [.35, .92]. We used metaregression to evaluate potential moderators of the PTSD effect size. Number of sessions significantly predicted magnitude of the effect size, and studies that utilized an active control group (e.g., supportive counseling) had significantly smaller effect size than those with a passive control group. There was no difference in outcome for studies where an interpreter was used to facilitate sessions and those where no interpreter was used. There also was no difference in outcome based on type of PTSD assessment. Results provide evidence in the efficacy of trauma-focused models for treating refugees, and also shed light on important areas for future research.

1133,Rising rates of depression in today's society: Consideration of the roles of effort-based rewards and enhanced resilience in day-to-day functioning,"Despite the existence of a vastly improved health care system and a multi-billion dollar antidepressant industry, the rates of depression in the US remain alarmingly high. An exploration of lifestyle changes over the past century suggests that the level of physical activity necessary to provide life's basic resources, referred to as effort-based rewards, has diminished in our industrialized, technologically advanced, service-oriented society. The evolution of the accumbens-striatal-cortical circuitry and its modulating neurochemicals in our ancestors played a significant role in sustaining the continued effort critical for the acquisition of resources such as food, water and shelter; consequently, vast reductions in the degree of physical activity required to obtain necessary resources in today's society likely lead to reduced activation of brain areas essential for reward/pleasure, motivation, problem-solving, and effective coping strategies (i.e. depressive symptomology). Comparative cultural and gender analyses reinforce the significant role of effort-based rewards in mood regulation, suggesting that minimal engagement in such endeavors leads to compromised resilience upon exposure to life's stressful challenges. If physical activity is indeed important in the maintenance of mental health, increased emphasis on behavioral and behavioral/cognitive preventative life strategies, as opposed to an emphasis on psychopharmacological strategies directed at very specific neurochemicals after the onset of depression, should be adopted as protective measures against the onset of depressive symptomology. Thus, strategies that include more global neurobiological activation in the relevant context of directed efforts provide a fresh perspective for depression research. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to validate the Italian version of WSM our goals included the translation from English to Italian of the WSM workbook and the implementation of an abbreviated WSM program in an Italian day hospital setting. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial 14 patients with a diagnosis of severe mental illness were recruited and randomly assigned to two groups. Seven individuals received an abbreviated version of WSM, while the controls received Treatment as Usual. Groups did not differ for age, education, cognitive functioning and symptomatology. All patients received weekly planned treatment in the day hospital setting. After treatment, group differences on change scores were tested using ANOVA. Results: Compared to controls, at immediate post-intervention, WSM participants reported significant improvement in processing speed, psychopathology, neurocognitive and personal resources and real-life functioning. Conclusions: These results offer promising preliminary evidence that the use of an abbreviated Italian translation of the WSM workbook provides an effective complement to current mental health treatment.

Methods: Healthy, nonsmoking, habitual coffee drinkers (N = 21) received daily doses of 100 mg and 500 mg of caffeine on 2 days in a crossover design. Treatment order was random and counterbalanced, and administration was double-blind. Ambulatory monitoring was conducted for 6 to 9 hours during normal workday activities and diary entries were completed at each measurement. Ambulatory data were analyzed for the effects of caffeine dose, controlling for variations in posture, physical activity, and perceived stress. Results: The average workday blood pressure and heart rate were significantly higher when the higher dose of caffeine was consumed. Controlling for other factors, dose-related differences were 4 mm Hg for systolic and 3 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure, and were 3 bpm for heart rate. Conclusions: Results support earlier evidence that caffeine raises blood pressure at work, and demonstrate that these pressor effects are independent of changes in posture, physical activity, or stress. Daily blood pressure increases associated with caffeine consumption could increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. In addition, caffeine consumption effects might confound ambulatory investigations of the cardiovascular effects of other psychosocial, personality, or health-behavior factors.","Lane J.D., Phillips-Bute B.G., Pieper C.F.",0,10.1097/00006842-199805000-00019,869
1137,Caffeine affects cardiovascular and neuroendocrine activation at work and home,"Objective: This study investigated the effects of moderate doses of caffeine on ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate, urinary excretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol, and subjective measures of stress during normal activities at work and at home in the evening. Methods: Healthy, nonsmoking, habitual coffee drinkers (N = 47) participated in 3 days of ambulatory study. After a day of ad lib caffeine consumption, caffeine (500 mg) and placebo were administered double-blind in counter-balanced order on separate workdays. Ambulatory blood pressure and heart rate were monitored from the start of the workday until bedtime. Urinary excretion of catecholamines and cortisol was assessed during the workday and evening. Results: Caffeine administration significantly raised average ambulatory blood pressure during the workday and evening by 4/3 mm Hg and reduced average heart rate by 2 bpm. Caffeine also increased by 32% the levels of free epinephrine excreted during the workday and the evening. In addition, caffeine amplified the increases in blood pressure and heart rate associated with higher levels of self-reported stress during the activities of the day. Effects were undiminished through the evening until bedtime. Conclusions: Caffeine has significant hemodynamic and humoral effects in habitual coffee drinkers that persist for many hours during the activities of everyday life. Furthermore, caffeine may exaggerate sympathetic adrenal-medullary responses to the stressful events of normal daily life. Repeated daily blood pressure elevations and increases in stress reactivity caused by caffeine consumption could contribute to an increased risk of coronary heart disease in the adult population.","Lane J.D., Pieper C.F., Phillips-Bute B.G., Bryant J.E., Kuhn C.M.",0,10.1097/01.PSY.0000021946.90613.DB,870
1140,THE LATIN-AMERICAN TRIAL OF PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT DURING PREGNANCY - A SOCIAL-INTERVENTION EVALUATED THROUGH AN EXPERIMENTAL-DESIGN,"Perinatal health problems are a public health priority in Latin America. Among the identified risk factors, psychological and social conditions play a crucial role. However. care during pregnancy and delivery in the region is usually hospital-centered and does not address women's psychological and social conditions. The preeminence of research on perinatal health, along with the necessity for testing interventions that represent alternative models to improve women's health, gave the Latin American Network for Perinatal and Reproductive Research grounds to develop a multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate a program of social support and health education during pregnancy. The conceptual framework for this study was based on an ecological model of social support, i.e. a model in which social support and health education play a synergistic role and are meant to modify stressful situations and negative health-related behaviors. The target population consisted of women attending obstetric hospitals before the 22nd gestational week, at high psychological and social risk (n = 2236).The intervention consisted of four to six home visits, carried out by social workers, and had four main components: the reinforcement of pregnant women's social support network, emotional support, health education, and the improvement of health services utilization. The main foci of the intervention were determined after an ethnographic study was carried out to identify stress-producing situations and needs for support during pregnancy. Besides the home visits, the program a so offered a hot-line, an office in the hospital, a specially designed poster and booklet, and a 'guided tour' of the health institution. Since this was a multicenter trial, the program's standardization was a crucial methodological aspect that was achieved through the training course for the home-visitors team. Biological and psychosocial outcomes were measured in both experimental and control groups at the 36th week of gestational age, post-partum and at the 40th day after delivery.The attributes of the multicenter population showed an important variability, reflecting differences in the countries or hospitals' population prevalent attributes. The results of the program's implementation were analyzed, demonstrating that home visitors adapted topics discussed during the interviews to the women's conditions and the stage of pregnancy during which the visit took place.In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring social interventions through an experimental design; we discuss the benefits of developing an explicit conceptual and analytical framework; we show the possibility of applying a social program to a numerous and heterogeneous population; and we propose a methodology for the development of a social program which is specific to a population's needs, standardized and flexible at the same time.","LANGER, A; VICTORA, C; VICTORA, M; BARROS, F; FARNOT, U; BELIZAN, J; VILLAR, J",0,10.1016/0277-9536(93)90411-V,871
1141,Swiss Cancer League communication skills training programme for oncology nurses: an evaluation,"P>Aim.This paper is a report of an evaluation of the effectiveness of a communication skills training programme for oncology nurses.Background.Clinical care for patients with cancer is increasingly being divided between nurses and physicians, with nurses being responsible for the continuity of patient care, and oncologists choosing and explaining the basics of anti-cancer therapy. Therefore, oncology nurses will profit from evidence-based communication skills training to allow them to perform in a professional way.Methods.Between 2003 and 2006 pre- and post-intervention videos of interviews with simulated patients were compared using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. Patient centeredness was assessed by counting segments of appropriate mutual responding to cues and by calculating length of uninterrupted patient speech.Findings.Appropriate empathic (1 center dot 6% vs. 3 center dot 2%), reassuring statements (2 center dot 3% vs. 3 center dot 4%), questions concerning psychosocial information (2 center dot 8% vs. 4 center dot 0%) increased statistically significantly; utterances containing medical information decreased on the part of nurses (17 center dot 8% vs. 13 center dot 3%) and patients (8 center dot 1% vs. 6 center dot 7%); and patients provided more psychosocial information (3 center dot 3% vs. 5 center dot 7%). The level of congruence and empathic responses to patients' emotional cues increased statistically significantly, as did the length of uninterrupted speech (3 center dot 7-4 center dot 3 utterances; all P < 0 center dot 05).Conclusion.The communication skills training of the Swiss Cancer League could be used as a model to achieve substantial improvements in patient-centred communication. Sequence analysis of utterances from patient-provider interaction should be used to assess the amount of patient-centred talk.","Langewitz, Wolf; Heydrich, Lukas; Nuebling, Matthias; Szirt, Linda; Weber, Heidemarie; Grossman, Paul",0,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2010.05386.x,872
1144,Management of post traumatic stress disorder after childbirth: A review,"Prevalence and risk factors for the development of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childbirth is well described in the literature. However, its management and treatment has only begun to be investigated. The aim of this article is to describe the studies that examine the effects of interventions on PTSD after childbirth. MedLine, PILOTS, CINAHL and ISI Web of Science databases were systematically searched for randomised controlled trials, pilot studies and case studies using key words related to PTSD, childbirth, treatment and intervention. The reference lists of the retrieved articles were also used to supplement the search. A total of nine studies were retrieved. Seven studies that examined debriefing or counselling were identified; six randomised controlled trials and one pilot study. Also found were one case report describing the effects of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on two women, and one pilot study of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Overall, there is limited evidence concerning the management of women with PTSD after childbirth. The results agree with the findings from the non-childbirth related literature: debriefing and counselling are inconclusively effective while CBT and EMDR may improve PTSD status but require investigation in controlled trials before conclusions could be drawn.

1145,Calcium and vitamin D supplementation decreases incidence of stress fractures in female Navy recruits,"Introduction: Stress fractures (SFx) are one of the most common and debilitating overuse injuries seen in military recruits, and they are also problematic for nonmilitary athletic populations. The goal of this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to determine whether a calcium and vitamin D intervention could reduce the incidence of SFx in female recruits during basic training.Materials and Methods: We recruited 5201 female Navy recruit volunteers and randomized them to 2000 mg calcium and 800 IU vitamin D/d or placebo. SFx were ascertained when recruits reported to the Great Lakes clinic with symptoms. All SFx were confirmed with radiography or technetium scan according to the usual Navy protocol.Results: A total of 309 subjects were diagnosed with a SFx resulting in an incidence of 5.9% per 8 wk. Using intention-to-treat analysis by including all enrolled subjects, we found that the calcium and vitamin D group had a 20% lower incidence of SFx than the control group (5.3% versus 6.6%, respectively, p = 0.0026 for Fisher's exact test). The per protocol analysis, including only the 3700 recruits who completed the study, found a 21% lower incidence of fractures in the supplemented versus the control group (6.8% versus 8.6%, respectively, p = 0.02 for Fisher's exact test).Conclusions: Generalizing the findings to the population of 14,416 women who entered basic training at the Great Lakes during the 24 mo of recruitment, calcium and vitamin D supplementation for the entire cohort would have prevented similar to 187 persons from fracturing. Such a decrease in SFx would be associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and financial costs.","Lappe, Joan; Cullen, Diane; Haynatzki, Gleb; Recker, Robert; Ahlf, Renee; Thompson, Kerry",0,10.1359/JBMR.0080102,874
1146,Beneficial effects of aged garlic extract and coenzyme Q10 on vascular elasticity and endothelial function: The FAITH randomized clinical trial,"Objective: Aged garlic extract (AGE) is associated with a significant decrease in atherosclerotic plaque progression and endothelial function improvement. Similarly, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has significant beneficial effects on endothelial function. A stressful lifestyle is a well-known risk factor for the presence and progression of atherosclerosis. This study investigated the effect of AGE plus CoQ10 on vascular elasticity measured by pulse-wave velocity (PWV) and endothelial function measured by digital thermal monitoring (DTM) in firefighters.Methods: Sixty-five Los-Angeles County firefighters who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled in this placebo-controlled, double-blinded randomized trial. The firefighters were randomized to four tablets of AGE (300 mg/tablet) plus CoQ10 (30 mg/tablet) or placebo. The participants underwent quarterly visits and 1-year follow-up. PWV and DTM were measured at baseline and at the 1-year follow-up.Results: There were no significant differences in age, cardiovascular risk factors, PWV, and DTM between the AGE/CoQ10 and placebo groups at baseline (P > 0.5). At 1-y, PWV and DTM significantly improved in the AGE/CoQ10 compared with the placebo group (P < 0.05). After an adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and statin therapy, the mean decrease in vascular stiffness (PWV) was 1.21 m/s in the AGE/CoQ10 compared with the placebo group (P = 0.005). Similarly, the mean increase in the area under the temperature curve, the DTM index of endothelial function, was 31.3 in the AGE/CoQ10 compared with the placebo group (P = 0.01).Conclusion: The combination of AGE and CoQ10 was independently associated with significant beneficial effects on vascular elasticity and endothelial function in firefighters with high occupational stress, highlighting the important role of AGE and CoQ10 in atherosclerotic prevention of such individuals.

1147,Hypertension,"Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a global health problem associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Research has shown that exposure to chronic life stress is associated with elevated blood pressures and an increased incidence of hypertension. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how stress leads to the onset of hypertension, including the role of: (1) negative affect, (2) suppressed hostility, (3) emotional defensiveness, (4) cognitive functioning, and (5) cardiovascular reactivity to stress. Although support exists for each of these pathways, they have not been used for developing effective psychological treatments for patients seeking help in controlling or preventing hypertension.

1148,"Can custom-made biomechanic shoe orthoses prevent problems in the back and lower extremities? A randomized, controlled intervention trial of 146 military conscripts","Background: Shock-absorbing, and biomechanic shoe orthoses are frequently used in the prevention and treatment of back and lower extremity problems. One review concludes that the former is clinically effective in relation to prevention, whereas the latter has been tested in only 1 randomized clinical trial, concluding that stress fractures could be prevented.Objectives: To investigate if biomechanic shoe orthoses can prevent problems in the back and lower extremities and if reducing the number of days off-duty because of back or lower extremity problems is possible.Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled intervention trial.Study Subjects: One female and 145 male military conscripts (aged 18 to 24 years), representing 25% of all new conscripts in a Danish regiment.Method: Health data were collected by questionnaires at initiation of the study and 3 months later. Custom-made biomechanic shoe orthoses to be worn in military boots were provided to all in the study group during the 3-month intervention period. No intervention was provided for the control group. Differences between the 2 groups were tested with the chi-square test, and statistical significance was accepted at P <.05. Risk ratio (RR), risk difference (ARR), numbers needed to prevent (NNP), and cost per successfully prevented case were calculated.Outcome Variables: Outcome. variables included self-reported back and/or lower extremity problems; specific problems in the back or knees or shin splints, Achilles tendonitis, sprained ankle, or other problems in the lower extremity; number of subjects with at least 1 day off-duty because of back or lower extremity problems and total number of days off-duty within the first 3 months of military service because of back or lower extremity problems.Results: Results were significantly better in an actual-use analysis in the intervention group for total number of subjects with back or lower extremity problems (RR 0.7, ARR 19%, NNP 5, cost US $98); number of subjects with shin splints (RR 0.2, ARR 19%, NNP 5, cost US $101); number of off-duty days because of back or lower extremity problems (RR 0.6, ARR < 1%, NNP 200, cost US $3750). In an intention-to-treat analysis, a significant difference was found for only number of subjects with shin splints (RR 0.3, ARR 18%, NNP 6 cost US $105), whereas a worst-case analysis revealed no significant CD differences between the study groups.Conclusions: This study shows that it may be possible to prevent certain musculoskeletal problems in the back or lower extremities among military conscripts by using custom-made biomechanic shoe orthoses. However, because care-seeking for lower extremity problems is rare, using this method of prevention in military conscripts would be too costly. We also noted that the choice of statistical approach determined the outcome.","Larsen, K; Weidich, F; Leboeuf-Yde, C",0,10.1067/mmt.2002.124419,877
1149,A randomized controlled pilot study of inflammatory gene expression in response to a stress management intervention for stem cell transplant caregivers,"Few studies have addressed whether stress-associated physiological changes in caregivers are reversible by psychological interventions mitigating distress. We report on pro-inflammatory, sympathetic, and oxidative stress gene expression in response to stress management for caregivers of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (Allo-HSCT) patients. Following randomization by permuted block to either treatment as usual (TAU, nÂ =Â 11) or a stress management intervention (PsychoEducation, Paced Respiration, and Relaxation, PEPRR, nÂ =Â 13), twenty-four caregivers were selected at the conclusion of a larger trial of 149 caregivers. PEPRR was provided one-on-one beginning around transplant. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling was conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected prior to randomization and on completion of PEPRR 3Â months post-transplant. Bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated reduced activity of transcription control pathways associated with inflammation (NF-ÎºB), sympathetic nervous system (CREB), and oxidative stress (NRF2) in caregivers receiving PEPRR compared to TAU aligning with reductions in stress, depression, and anxiety. This suggests that PEPRR may alter transcriptomic effects reported for distressed individuals.

1150,Attitudes and practices regarding influenza vaccination among healthcare workers providing services to individuals with spinal cord injuries and disorders,"OBJECTIVE: To examine influenza vaccination status and predictors for vaccine receipt among healthcare workers (HCWs) caring for patients with spinal cord injuries and disorders.DESIGN: Cross-sectional, nationwide anonymous survey.SETTING: Twenty-three Veterans Affairs spinal cord injury centers.PARTICIPANTS: One thousand five hundred fifty-six HCWs.METHODS: the primary outcome was staff vaccination status. Independent variables included staff demographic and employment characteristics, health status, attitudes and beliefs about the vaccine, and implications for its use.RESULTS: The staff vaccination rate was 51%. Leading motivators of vaccine receipt were self-protection (77%) and patient protection (49%). The most common reasons for nonreceipt were concerns about side effects (49%), preventive quality (20%), and inconvenience (14%). Logistic regression results suggested that age of 50 years or older (OR, 1.47; P =.021), male gender (OR, 2.50; P <.001), strong belief in vaccine effectiveness (OR, 19.03; P =.008), and importance of HCW vaccination (OR, 20.50; P =.005) significantly increased the probability of vaccination. Recommending the vaccine to coworkers, patients, or patients' families was also associated with HCW vaccination (OR, 3.20; P <.001). Providers who did not believe the vaccine was protective (P <.001) or effective (P <.001) were less likely to recommend it to patients.CONCLUSIONS: Strategies to increase vaccination rates among HCWs should address concerns about side effects, effectiveness, and protective value of the vaccine and access to it. The impact of provider recommendations should be stressed. Vaccination and subsequent prevention of illness may limit morbidity and mortality, thus benefiting HCWs, healthcare facilities, and patients (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2004;25:933-940).","LaVela, SL; Smith, B; Weaver, FM; Legro, MW; Goldstein, B; Nichol, K",0,10.1086/502323,879
1151,"A randomized, controlled trial of massage therapy as a treatment for migraine","Background: Migraine is a distressing disorder that is often triggered by stress and poor sleep. Only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) has assessed the effects of massage therapy on migraine experiences, which yielded some promising findings. Purpose: An RCT was designed to replicate and extend the earlier findings using a larger sample, additional stress-related indicators, and assessments past the final session to identify longer-term effects of massage therapy on stress and migraine experiences. Methods: Migraine sufferers (N = 47) who were randomly assigned to massage or control conditions completed daily assessments of migraine experiences and sleep patterns for 13 weeks. Massage participants attended weekly massage sessions during Weeks 5 to 10. State anxiety, heart rates, and salivary cortisol were assessed before and after the sessions. Perceived stress and coping efficacy were assessed at Weeks 4, 10, and 13. Results: Compared to control participants, massage participants exhibited greater improvements in migraine frequency and sleep quality during the intervention weeks and the 3 follow-up weeks. Trends for beneficial effects of massage therapy on perceived stress and coping efficacy were observed. During sessions, massage induced decreases in state anxiety, heart rate, and cortisol. Conclusions: The findings provide preliminary support for the utility of massage therapy as a nonpharmacologic treatment for individuals suffering from migraines.

1152,Preventing compulsory admission to psychiatric inpatient care through psycho-education and crisis focused monitoring,"Background: The high number of involuntary placements of people with mental disorders in Switzerland and other European countries constitutes a major public health issue. In view of the ethical and personal relevance of compulsory admission for the patients concerned and given the far-reaching effects in terms of health care costs, innovative interventions to improve the current situation are much needed. A number of promising approaches to prevent involuntary placements have been proposed that target continuity of care by increasing self-management skills of patients. However, the effectiveness of such interventions in terms of more robust criteria (e.g., admission rates) has not been sufficiently analysed in larger study samples. The current study aims to evaluate an intervention programme for patients at high risk of compulsory admission to psychiatric hospitals. Effectiveness will be assessed in terms of a reduced number of psychiatric hospitalisations and days of inpatient care in connection with involuntary psychiatric admissions as well as in terms of cost-containment in inpatient mental health care. The intervention furthermore intends to reduce the degree of patients' perceived coercion and to increase patient satisfaction, their quality of life and empowerment.Methods/Design: This paper describes the design of a randomised controlled intervention study conducted currently at four psychiatric hospitals in the Canton of Zurich. The intervention programme consists of individualised psycho-education focusing on behaviours prior to and during illness-related crisis, the distribution of a crisis card and, after inpatient admission, a 24-month preventive monitoring of individual risk factors for compulsory re-admission to hospital. All measures are provided by a mental health care worker who maintains permanent contact to the patient over the course of the study. In order to prove its effectiveness the intervention programme will be compared with standard care procedures (control group). 200 patients each will be assigned to the intervention group or to the control group. Detailed follow-up assessments of service use, psychopathology and patient perceptions are scheduled 12 and 24 months after discharge.Discussion: Innovative interventions have to be established to prevent patients with mental disorders from undergoing the experience of compulsory admission and, with regard to society as a whole, to reduce the costs of health care (and detention). The current study will allow for a prospective analysis of the effectiveness of an intervention programme, providing insight into processes and factors that determine involuntary placement.","Lay, Barbara; Salize, Hans Joachim; Dressing, Harald; Ruesch, Nicolas; Schoenenberger, Thekla; Buehlmann, Monika; Bleiker, Marco; Lengler, Silke; Korinth, Lena; Roessler, Wulf",0,10.1186/1471-244X-12-136,881

1155,Improving the Health and Well-Being of Community-Dwelling Caregivers of Dementia Sufferers: Study Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial of Structured Meditation Training,"Background: Caring for a person with dementia can be an unrelenting and burdensome task, one that is often detrimental to the caregiver's health, well-being, and functionality. The enduring stress and frustration of the caregiver role can also contribute to poorer outcomes for dementia sufferers. Building on growing clinical interest in the capacity for Transcendental Meditation (R) (TM; a relaxation technique) to reduce stress and anxiety in healthy workers, this study examines whether similar improvements could be experienced by dementia caregivers.Objective: The study objective was to ascertain whether a TM program can improve psychological stress, quality of life, affect, and cognitive performance of dementia caregivers.Design: The study was a pilot prospective, single-center, randomized wait-list controlled trial with two parallel arms.Setting/subjects: Community-dwelling carers of persons with diagnosed dementia, residing in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia, were included in this study.Interventions: Participants will be randomly assigned to a 13-hour TM training program or wait-list control over 12 weeks.Outcomes: Primary outcomes include quality of life and stress. Secondary outcomes include affect, cognitive performance, cost-effectiveness, and study feasibility. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, week 12 (post-intervention), and week 24 (follow-up).Results: Results are expected to be available early in 2014.Conclusions: This project responds to a need for robust evidence of the clinical and economic effectiveness of TM for the management of caregiver stress. If Transcendental Meditation is shown to be effective, it could indicate a simple, cost-effective, and easily implemented strategy to assist many of the growing numbers of caregivers to cope with the demanding and often difficult caregiver role.","Leach, Matthew J.; Francis, Andrew; Ziaian, Tahereh",0,10.1089/acm.2013.0170,883
1156,Transcendental Meditation for the improvement of health and wellbeing in community-dwelling dementia caregivers [TRANSCENDENT]: a randomised wait-list controlled trial,"Background: Dementia is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder affecting an estimated 24.3 million people across the globe. The burden on those caring for people with dementia is substantial, with widespread implications for the caregiver, the care recipient and the community. Relaxation techniques, such as Transcendental Meditation (R) (TM), have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety in healthy workers; similar benefits are anticipated in dementia caregivers. The objective of this study was to ascertain whether TM can improve psychological stress, quality of life, affect and cognitive performance in dementia caregivers.Methods: The study was conducted as a pilot prospective, multi-centre, community-based, randomised wait-list controlled trial. Community-dwelling caregivers of persons with diagnosed dementia were randomly assigned to a 12-week (14-hour) TM training program or wait-list control. Participants were assessed for quality of life, stress, affect, cognitive performance and adverse effects. The feasibility of the study was also evaluated.Results: Seventeen caregivers were recruited and randomised. Improvements in WebNeuro response speed scores over time were significantly (p = 0.03) greater in the TM group relative to control. Changes between groups over time in all other primary and secondary outcome measures did not reach statistical significance. However, there was a trend toward greater improvement in WebNeuro stress, depression and negativity bias scores in the TM group. Adverse events were reported amongst 63 % of TM-treated subjects; however, events were generally transient, of mild-moderate intensity and only 'possibly' related to TM.Conclusions: Dementia caregivers exposed to TM demonstrated varying degrees of improvement in several measures of cognitive function, mood, quality of life and stress following exposure to TM. However, as the pilot study was underpowered, no firm conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of TM in this caregiver population. Findings from full-scale trials are now warranted.","Leach, Matthew J.; Francis, Andrew; Ziaian, Tahereh",0,10.1186/s12906-015-0666-8,884
1157,Stress responses and decision making in child protection workers faced with high conflict situations,"Introduction: The assessment of children at risk of abuse and neglect is a critical societal function performed by child protection workers in situations of acute stress and conflict. Despite efforts to improve the reliability of risk assessments through standardized measures, available tools continue to rely on subjective judgment. The goal of this study was to assess the stress responses of child protection workers and their assessments of risk in high conflict situations. Methods: Ninety-six child protection workers participated in 2 simulated scenarios, 1 non-confrontational and 1 confrontational. In each scenario, participants conducted a 15-minute interview with a mother played by a specially trained actor. Following the interview, the workers completed 2 risk assessment measures used in the field at the time of the study. Anxiety was measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at baseline and immediately following the completion of each interview. Physiological stress as measured by salivary cortisol was obtained at baseline as well as 20 and 30. minutes after the start of each interview. Results: Participants demonstrated significant stress responses during the 1st scenario, regardless of whether the interview was confrontational or not. During the second scenario, the participants did not exhibit significant cortisol responses, however the confrontational interview elicited greater subjective anxiety than the non-confrontational scenario. In the first scenario, in which the workers demonstrated greater stress responses, risk assessment scores were higher on one risk assessment tool for the confrontational scenario than for the non-confrontational scenario. Conclusion: The results suggest that stress responses in child protection workers appear to be influenced by the novelty of a situation and by a parent's demeanor during interviews. Some forms of risk assessment tools appear to be more strongly associated than other with the workers' subjective and physiological stress responses. This merits further research to determine which aspects of risk assessment tools are susceptible to the emotional elements of intake interviews.

1158,Does a community-based stress management intervention affect psychological adaptation among underserved black breast cancer survivors?,"Background: In this randomized trial, Project CARE, we examined whether participation in a cognitive-behavioral stress management and breast cancer wellness and education program improved psychological outcomes among a sample of underserved black breast cancer survivors. Methods: Both complementary medicine interventions were 10-sessions, manualized, group-based, and were culturally adapted for black women in the community from evidence-based interventions. Participants were 114 black women (mean age = 51.1, 27-77 years) who had completed breast cancer treatment 0-12 months before enrollment (stages 0-IV, mean time since cancer diagnosis = 14.1 months). Women were enrolled upon completion of curative treatment (ie, surgical, chemotherapy, radiation oncology) and randomized to receive cognitivebehavioral stress management or cancer wellness and education program. Results: There was a remarkable 95% retention rate from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Participants in both conditions showed statistically significant improvement on indices of psychological well-being, including overall quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast), intrusive thoughts (Impact of Event Scale-Revised), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression), and stress levels (Perceived Stress Scale) over the 6-month postintervention follow-up (all repeated measures analysis of variance within-subjects time effects: P < .05, except for overall mood; Profile of Mood States-Short Version). Contrary to hypotheses, however, condition Ã— time effects were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Findings suggest that improvements in multiple measures over time may have been due to intensive training in stress management, extensive provision of breast cancer information, or participation in an ongoing supportive group of individuals from a similar racial background. Implications bear on decisions about appropriate control groups, the timing of intervention delivery during the treatment trajectory, and perceived support from the research team.

1159,"Trauma symptoms, recovery, and participation in the Wellness Management and Recovery (WMR) program","Despite the disproportionate prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among individuals with severe mental illness (SMI), and the emergence of effective trauma-specific treatments for comorbid PTSD/SMI, PTSD remains undertreated in this population. Literature points to two reasons for such: underdiagnosing of PTSD among individuals with SMI, and lack of clinician confidence/training in trauma-specific issues. A meta-analysis found non-trauma-specific groups reduced trauma symptoms in non-SMI populations. Against this backdrop, the purpose of this study was to determine whether individuals with SMI and trauma symptoms reported reduced trauma symptoms following completion of a non-trauma-specific, recovery-focused group treatment, the Wellness Management and Recovery (WMR) program. Pre- and post-WMR data were obtained from 54 participants via the Mental Health Recovery Measure and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist. Participants reported significant improvements in mental health recovery, and significant decreases in trauma symptoms. Results suggested that WMRâ€”a non-trauma-specific group programâ€”may offer promise in reducing trauma symptoms among individuals with SMI who may not have access to evidence-based trauma-specific treatments and/or who may not wish to specifically address trauma issues. Further exploration of the potential of WMR participation to reduce trauma symptoms among individuals with SMI is warranted.

This study was designed to investigate the psycho-endocrine differences between BMV practitioners and naÃ¯ve controls. Methods The experimental group included 54 individuals who had participated in BWV. The control group included 58 subjects who had not participated in formal BWV. Levels of plasma NO, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured, and the modified form of the Stress Response Inventory (SRI-MF), the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were administered. Results The BWV group demonstrated significantly higher plasma NO levels (p=0.003), and levels of ROS and SOD did not differ between the two groups. The BWV group showed lower scores in BDI (p=0.009), BAI (p=0.009) and stress level (p<0.001) and higher scores on positive affect (p=0.023) compared with the control group. NO levels were associated with increased positive affect (p = 0.024) only in BWV subjects. Conclusion BWV may increase NO, a relaxation-related factor, possibly by improving emotional state.

1161,Effectiveness of a meditation-based stress management program as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy in patients with anxiety disorder,"Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a meditation-based stress management program in patients with anxiety disorder. Methods: Patients with anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to an 8-week clinical trial of either a meditation-based stress management program or an anxiety disorder education program. The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) were used to measure outcome at 0, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of the program. Results: Compared to the education group, the meditation-based stress management group showed significant improvement in scores on all anxiety scales (HAM-A, P=.00; STAI state, P=.00; STAI trait, P=.00; anxiety subscale of SCL-90-R, P=.00) and in the SCL-90-R hostility subscale (P=.01). Findings on depression measures were inconsistent, with no significant improvement shown by subjects in the meditation-based stress management group compared to those in the education group. The meditation-based stress management group did not show significant improvement in somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and interpersonal sensitivity scores, or in the SCL-90-R phobic anxiety subscale compared to the education group. Conclusions: A meditation-based stress management program can be effective in relieving anxiety symptoms in patients with anxiety disorder. However, well-designed, randomized, and controlled trials are needed to scientifically prove the worth of this intervention prior to treatment. Â© 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1162,Determining the Effects of a Horticultural Therapy Program for Improving the Upper Limb Function and Balance Ability of Stroke Patients,"The objective of this study was to assess the physical and psychological effects of an 18-session horticultural therapy (HT) program based on task-oriented training in stroke patients and investigate patient satisfaction. The HT program consisted of horticultural activities including the motions such as reaching-grasping, squatting, stepping, and stooping. A total of 31 stroke inpatients (16 males, 15 females) at B rehabilitation hospital in Seongnam, South Korea, participated in this study. Fourteen stroke patients participated in a thrice weekly HT program (6 weeks, approximate to 60 minutes per session) between Aug. and Sept. 2016, whereas another 17 stoke patients comprised the control group. At the completion of the 18-session HT program, upper limb function [manual function test (MFT)], grip strength (hydraulic hand dynamometer), pinch force (hydraulic pinch gauge), fine motor skills (9-hole pegboard), balance [Berg Balance Scale (BBS)], and activities of daily living (Modified Barthel Index) were evaluated in both groups. In addition, depression [The Korean version of the short form of Geriatric Depression Scales (SGDS-K)], rehabilitation stress (Rehabilitation Stress Scales), rehabilitation motivation (Rehabilitation Motivation Scales), and fall efficacy (The Korean version of the Falls Efficacy Scale) were evaluated. Stroke patients in the HT group showed significantly improved upper limb function, hand force, balance, fall efficacy, activities of daily living, and decreased depression (P < 0.05). By contrast, no significant change was noted in the control group. In addition, 85.7% of the stroke patients in the HT group reported being very satisfied or satisfied with the HT program. In conclusion, the HT program based on task-oriented training improved the patients' physical and psychological function after stroke rehabilitation. These study results suggest that implementing an HT program in a rehabilitation hospital will effectively contribute to functional recovery after stroke.","Lee, A-Young; Park, Sin-Ae; Park, Hye-Gyeong; Son, Ki-Cheol",0,10.21273/HORTSCI12639-17,890

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a work-related stress management program on perceived work-related stress in patients with chronic schizophrenia. METHOD. A single-blind, randomized crossover design was used. Twenty-nine patients undergoing vocational training while working at paid part-time jobs in a psychiatric center were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of a work-related stress management program followed by 12 weeks of no treatment, or the reverse. The Work-Related Stress Questionnaire for Chronic Psychiatric Patients (WSQP) was developed for this study and used to examine the treatment effect. RESULTS. The decrease in stress was significantly greater when the participants were undergoing the program compared to the decrease of stress when they were not (t = 2.93, p = .0034, r = .49). CONCLUSION. The results show that the work-related stress management program had large short-term positive effects on the patients' perceived work-related stress.

1166,Exclusion of participants based on substance use status: Findings from randomized controlled trials of treatments for PTSD,"Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more than four times as likely as those without PTSD to have substance use disorder (SUD), making it critical to understand the interaction of substance use status and PTSD outcomes. Using the broader treatment literature, we examined PTSD treatment effects, with and without co-morbid SUD, by extending a published meta-analysis to include recent studies. From reports of 156 Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), we extracted exclusion criteria based on substance use and findings involving substance use as a predictor or outcome. Almost three-quarters of RCT designs excluded participants based on substance use status. Only 29.5% reported descriptive statistics characterizing substance use within the study sample and only 7.7% reported substance use-related outcomes. There was no clear relationship between exclusion criteria based on substance use and PTSD outcome or participant retention, suggesting either that SUD does not impede treatment effects, or that available studies lack sufficient data for these analyses. Importantly, no studies reported significant increases in substance use in the course of PTSD treatment. We conclude that patients with PTSD and co-morbid SUD have been largely neglected in PTSD RCTs; thus findings may not be fully applicable to those meeting criteria for both conditions.

1167,Keynote lecture: Relatives' expressed emotion: From measurement technique to practical help for families,"The measurement of Expressed Emotion (EE) has proved to be one of the most useful predictive tools in psychiatry. It is associated with the outcome of schizophrenia, mania, depressive neurosis, eating disorders, child abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, and alcoholism. Numerous studies on schizophrenia have shown that the association between EE and outcome is independent of culture and language, indicating the universality of patients' psychological responses to emotional relationships. On this scientific basis, programs have been developed to work with families to alter the patients' emotional environment. Evaluation of these programs has been carried out by a series of randomized, controlled trials. The results of these trials have been consistent, showing that when family work is added to maintenance with antipsychotic drugs, the relapse rate is reduced by one half over two years. In order to make the skills of family work available, national training networks have begun to be established in Britain, and are successful in equipping community psychiatric staff with the necessary skills. However, trained workers are finding it difficult to put their expertise into practice. This problem may be overcome by involving managers in the initial stages of the training.","Leff, J",0,,894
1169,Psychological aspects of asthma,"Asthma can be affected by stress, anxiety, sadness, and suggestion, as well as by environmental irritants or allergens, exercise, and infection. It also is associated with an elevated prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders. Asthma and these psychological states and traits may mutually potentiate each other through direct psychophysiological mediation, nonadherence to medical regimen, exposure to asthma triggers, and inaccuracy of asthma symptom perception. Defensiveness is associated with inaccurate perception of airway resistance and stress-related bronchoconstriction. Asthma education programs that teach about the nature of the disease, medications, and trigger avoidance tend to reduce asthma morbidity. Other promising psychological interventions as adjuncts to medical treatment include training in symptom perception, stress management, hypnosis, yoga, and several biofeedback procedures.","Lehrer P., Feldman J., Giardino N., Song H.-S., Schmaling K.",0,10.1037//0022-006X.70.3.691,895
1170,Predicting first onset of depression in young girls: Interaction of diurnal cortisol and negative life events,"Interactions between biological vulnerability and environmental adversity are central to the pathophysiology of depression. Given evidence that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis influences biological responses to environmental events, in the current longitudinal study the authors examined HPA-axis functioning, negative life events, and their interaction as predictors of the first onset of depression. At baseline, girls ages 9 to 14 years provided saliva samples to assess levels of diurnal cortisol production, quantified by total cortisol production (area under the curve with respect to ground; AUCg) and the cortisol awakening response (CAR). The authors then followed these participants until they reached age 18 in order to assess their subsequent experience of negative life events and the onset of a depressive episode. They found that the influence of negative life events on the subsequent onset of depression depended on HPA-axis functioning at baseline. Specifically, negative life events predicted the onset of depression in girls with higher levels of AUCg, but not in girls with lower levels of AUCg. In contrast, CAR did not predict the onset of depression either alone or in interaction with negative life events. These findings suggest that elevated total cortisol production in daily life potentiates susceptibility to environmental adversity and signals the need for early intervention.

1171,Feasibility of the mobile mindfulness-based stress reduction for breast cancer (mMBSR(BC)) program for symptom improvement among breast cancer survivors,"Objective: The purpose of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of delivering the mobile mindfulness-based stress reduction for breast cancer (mMBSR(BC)) program using an iPad and to evaluate its impact on symptom improvement. Methods: A single group, pre-posttest design was implemented among female stages 0-III breast cancer survivors (BCS) who completed treatment. Data were collected at baseline and week 6 on measures of psychological and physical symptoms and quality of life. The mMBSR(BC) program is a standardized, stress-reducing intervention that combines sitting and walking meditation, body scan, and yoga and is designed to deliver weekly 2-hour sessions for 6Â weeks using an iPad. Results: The mean age of the 15 enrolled BCS was 57Â years; one participant was non-Hispanic black, and 14 were non-Hispanic white. Of the 13 who completed the study, there were significant improvements from baseline to 6Â weeks post-mMBSR(BC) in psychological and physical symptoms of depression, state anxiety, stress, fear of recurrence, sleep quality, fatigue, and quality of life (P'sÂ <.05). Effect sizes for improvements of multiple symptoms ranged from medium to large. Conclusions: These results provide preliminary support that the mMBSR(BC) program may be feasible and acceptable, showing a clinical impact on decreasing psychological and physical symptoms. This mobile-based program offers a delivery of a standardized MBSR(BC) intervention to BCS that is convenient for their own schedule while decreasing symptom burden in the survivorship phase after treatment for breast cancer.

1172,Effectiveness and feasibility of a 10-minute employee stress intervention: Outdoor Booster Break,"There is a growing recognition that workplace environments affect employee health. Nature contact exposures in the workplace have been shown to be healthful for employees. This pilot study was designed to test the feasibility and efficacy of a daily outdoor work break (Outdoor Booster Break) compared to a daily indoor break. A census of university office staff was invited to participate (N = 244). Phase 1 focused on feasibilityâ€”participants (n = 119) reported that the Outdoor Booster Break was feasible (74%), practical (80%), and worthwhile (83%). During Phase II we used a single-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effects of an Outdoor Booster Breakâ€”compared with a control indoor work break groupâ€”for 4 weeks on employee stress. Perceived stress was measured at pretest and posttest for both conditions. Mean posttest stress scores were lower for both the control group (n = 19) and the treatment group (n = 18). A main effects ANCOVA model controlling for baseline stress revealed posttest stress was lower for the treatment group compared to controls (p =.041). Taking a work break appears to have stress-reducing benefits, but the Outdoor Booster Break reduced stress significantly more than an indoor break. Implications for employers, worksite health promoters, and future research are discussed.

1174,Psychosocial factors in peptic ulcer and inflammatory bowel disease,"Over the past decade, while gastroenterologists' interest in mind-body interactions in organic disorders dwindled, stronger evidence has linked psychosocial factors with the incidence and recurrence of peptic ulcer and with the course of inflammatory bowel disease. Psychological-behavioral approaches to treatment continue to be disappointing. Psychosocial factors may affect ulcer by increasing duodenal acid load, altering local circulation or motility, intensifying Helicobacter pylori infection, stimulating corticosteroid secretion, and affecting health risk behaviors; possible mechanisms for inflammatory bowel disease include immune deregulation, gut permeability changes, and poor medication adherence. Both belong to the growing category of diseases thought to have an infectious component: for peptic ulcer the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, for inflammatory bowel disease an exaggerated immune response to gut bacteria. Peptic ulcer and inflammatory bowel disease, which present unique interactions among psychological, immunologic, endocrine, infectious, and behavioral factors, are splendid paradigms of the biopsychosocial model.",Levenstein S.,0,10.1037//0022-006X.70.3.739,900

Psychosocial issues may be prevalent among these women. This study examined the efficacy of a gynecological cancer resource program. Fifty-three women completed questionnaires over a year's time. The women felt positively about the program, and used several of the services. The most used services were that of the center coordinator/nurse practitioner, the GYN support group, the hair consultant, and the imagery sessions. The social worker, massage therapist, and the nutritionist seemed to be important at the beginning of the cancer experience but not so much at later stages. Having a nurse practitioner who could talk about treatment side effects, menopause, body image, sexuality, etc., was helpful to at least half of the women.

1176,An exploratory study of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction for emotional eating,"Emotional eating is an important predictor of weight loss and weight regain after weight loss. This two part study's primary aim was to explore changes in emotional eating in a general population of individuals taking the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program, with a secondary aim to explore whether changes in mindfulness predicted changes in emotional eating. Self-reported survey data exploring these questions were collected before and after the intervention for two sequential studies (Study 1 and Study 2). While there were no control groups for either study, in both studies emotional eating scores following the MBSR were significantly lower than scores prior to taking the MBSR (pÂ <Â 0.001; pÂ <Â 0.001) In Study 2, changes in mindfulness were correlated with changes in emotional eating (rÂ =Â 0.317, pÂ =Â 0.004). These results suggest that MBSR may be an effective intervention for emotional eating, and that further research is warranted to examine effects on weight loss and maintenance.

A systematic research synthesis of psychological debriefings,"Psychological debriefings (PDs) have proliferated throughout the trauma and mental health community under the auspice as a one-shot preventive intervention to mitigate acute stress reactions and prevent the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The author presents the results of a systematic research synthesis (SRS) of the available literature on the many variants of PDs. Fifteen empirical studies were systematically analyzed to determine the empirical status of PDs, examine the contention that debriefings prevent PTSD, and investigate the context and with whom PDs demonstrate effectiveness. In toto, PDs lack empirical support. Furthermore, the studies examined had a number of methodological shortcomings, which accent the need for further, well-controlled research of the components of debriefings, experience and training of debriefing providers, and the appropriate context and population prescriptive of PD.

Both within-and across-case analyses were performed.RESULTS: The IPS-process concerned job search support, job-matches (PEO-match), and adjustment of the PEO-match by providing accommodations by on-and off-worksite support. All participants had limitations concerning social interactions and handling symptoms/tolerating stress. Several accommodations were made for the same limitations, mostly directed towards the social environment. Prior work experience, disclosure, and not being in an acute phase of illness seemed important to the support provided.CONCLUSIONS: This study has visualised the support and process in IPS and provided a theoretical framework, the PEO-model, to detect limitations and provide IPS-support. The organization of IPS-support and methods of providing it to individuals may be important for job tenure and employment success.","Lexen, Annika; Hofgren, Caisa; Bejerholm, Ulrika",0,10.3233/WOR-2012-1360,904
1180,Exploring flow in sport and exercise therapy with war and torture survivors,"War and torture survivors often suffer from posttraumatic stress and intrusive memories from past experiences. Thus, they can hardly focus on the â€˜here and nowâ€™. However, there are some indications that people may fade out illness-related thoughts while exercising, e.g. through flow experiences, which may be therapeutically meaningful. Therefore, the present study focused on exploring whether and how flow occurred during a sport and exercise therapy programme with war and torture survivors. Data from participant observation were coded and analysed for the intervention groups (2013â€“2015) with a category system using the software Atlas.ti. Event-focused analysis was complemented with person-focused analysis identifying the occurrence of flow and potential influencing factors. The results suggest that four participants achieved flow several times, particularly during team sports, games, movement improvisations and dance tasks. Hindering factors included task and setting-related aspects that triggered trauma-related distress, quick changes in affective experiencing and momentary well-being. Sense of safety was identified as a condition for the occurrence of flow in this study. The experience of pleasure, the distraction from illness-related thoughts, the being in the present â€˜here and nowâ€™, the experience of mastery and achievements, as well as activation and motivation for physical activity seemed therapeutically meaningful effects relating to flow in this population. Therefore, the minimisation of potential hindering factors is recommended, together with the provision of adequate tasks and a setting that favours flow occurrence in sport and exercise therapy.

1182,How Does a Reward for Creativity Program Benefit or Frustrate Employee Creative Performance? The Perspective of Transactional Model of Stress and Coping,"We explore the effect of a reward for creativity program on employee creativity in organizations by investigating the underlying mechanisms based on the transactional model of stress and copinga novel theoretical perspective for this research area. We theorize and find in two field studies that challenge appraisal of a reward for creativity program (perceived potential for gain, growth, or mastery) is positively related to problem-focused coping, which in turn predicts high creative performance. By contrast, threat appraisal of a reward for creativity program (perceived potential for harms or losses) is positively related to emotion-focused coping in the form of blaming, which in turn predicts low creative performance. Our findings also support the different indirect effects of the two appraisals of a reward for creativity program on creative performance through coping strategies. In addition, we find self-efficacy that is an antecedent of individual appraisals. We discuss the implications of the findings for theory development and managerial practice and suggest some important avenues for future research.","Li, F; Chen, TT; Lai, X",0,10.1177/1059601116688612,907
1188,"Cognitive function, stress hormones, heart rate and nutritional status during simulated captivity in military survival training","Stress influences numerous psychological and physiological processes, and its effects have practical implications in a variety of professions and real-world activities. However, few studies have concurrently assessed multiple behavioral, hormonal, nutritional and heart-rate responses of humans to acute, severe stress. This investigation simultaneously assessed cognitive, affective, hormonal, and heart-rate responses induced by an intensely stressful real-world environment designed to simulate wartime captivity. Sixty males were evaluated during and immediately following participation in U.S. Army Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) school, three weeks of intense but standardized training for Soldiers at risk of capture. Simulated captivity and intense mock interrogations degraded grammatical reasoning (pÂ <Â 0.005), sustained-attention (pÂ <Â 0.001), working memory (pÂ <Â 0.05) and all aspects of mood assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire: Tension/Anxiety, Depression/Dejection, Anger/Hostility, Vigor/Activity, Fatigue/Inertia; Confusion/Bewilderment, and Total Mood Disturbance (pÂ <Â 0.001) It also elevated heart rate (pÂ <Â 0.001); increased serum and salivary cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-s) (pÂ <Â 0.01); elevated serum epinephrine, norepinephrine, and soluble transferrin receptors (sTfR) (pÂ <Â 0.01); increased salivary neuropeptide-Y (NPY) (pÂ <Â 0.001); and decreased serum prolactin and serum and salivary testosterone (pÂ <Â 0.001). Partial recovery was observed immediately after training, but stress-induced changes, particularly in body weight and several of the biomarkers, persisted. This study demonstrates that when individuals were exposed to realistic and controlled simulated captivity, cognition, mood, stress hormones, nutritional status and heart rate are simultaneously altered, and each of these subsequently recovers at different rates.

1189,Improved Mood State and Absence of Sex Differences in Response to the Stress of Army Basic Combat Training,"Background: It is reported that women are more susceptible to stress than men but they have not been compared in stressful, real-world, team-centered, occupational/training environments. This study investigated effects of Army Basic Combat Training (BCT), a structured military training program, on the mood of young adult men and women. Methods: Using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire, 169 soldiers (98 men and 71 women) were assessed prior to starting BCT and after each phase of training. Results: Significant improvements were found in five of six subscales over the course of BCT. Men and women responded positively and similarly to BCT. POMS scores attributable to an interaction of time and each factor of sex, age group, education level, ethnicity, and race were not significantly different. Conclusions: When studied in the same environment and exposed to the same stressors, men and women in this study responded similarly. The positive changes in mood in both sexes during BCT appear to result from the interaction of a structured physical and cognitive training program conducted in a team-oriented environment, and indicate that BCT enhances soldier mood similarly regardless of sex.

The differences in unilateral and bilateral motor performance, daily functions, and quality of parental well-being (i.e., the stress level of their parents) were evaluated. The study included 21 children with CP (age range, 48-119 months) who were randomly assigned to the CIT or control group. All participants received individualized home-based interventions, 3.5-4. h a day, twice a week for 4. weeks. Primary outcomes were measured by the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales II (PDMS-2) and the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP) is the whole name of the assessment. All first letters of this instrument title should be in upper case. Secondary outcome measures were the Pediatric Motor Activity Log (PMAL), the Caregiver Functional Use Survey (CFUS), and the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI). Outcome measures were performed at baseline (pretreatment), 4. weeks (posttreatment), and 6-month (follow-up). Compared with the control group, the CIT group exhibited significantly better performance in grasping control as measured by the PDMS-2, unilateral/bilateral motor efficacy as measured by the BOTMP, and unilateral hand function as measured by the PMAL immediately after the treatment. At the 6-month follow-up, CIT had beneficial effects on grasping control assessed by PDMS-2 and on unilateral/bilateral functional performance measured by the PMAL and CFUS. Parents in both groups reported comparable stress levels at the 6-month follow-up, although the parent-child dysfunctional interaction deteriorated more immediately after CIT than after the control intervention. The follow-up of this randomized controlled trial suggested beneficial effects of home-based CIT on unilateral grasping skills and unilateral/bilateral functional performance at 6 months. The higher stress level reported by the parents in the CIT group than in the control group at posttreatment is temporary and could be alleviated at a longer period of time. Home-based CIT is a feasible and effective alternative to the intervention administered at clinics.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a combination of health education, muscle relaxation, and back massage on reducing physical and psychologic stress in HCC patients receiving TAE. A quasi-experimental design was used. Forty patients with HCC (30 men and 10 women) with a mean age of 57 Â± 12 years were recruited and randomly assigned to the control or experimental group. The effectiveness of the stress management program was evaluated using a knowledge questionnaire, a worry inventory, a state-trait anxiety inventory, and a physical distress scale. After completing the stress management program, the experimental group had a greater mean increase in knowledge score than the control group (5.1 vs 0.8, p < 0.0001) and a greater mean decrease in worry score (-8.2 vs 1.1, P < 0.0001). The mean decrease in the anxiety score in the experimental group was also significantly greater than in the control group before TAE (-5.8 vs 3.2, p < 0.001) and 2, 4, 6, and 7 days after TAE (-8.2 vs 7.1, p < 0.001; -8.7 vs 3.2, p < 0.001; -9.8 vs -2.1, p < 0.05; -11 vs -0.9, p < 0.05). The patients in the experimental group had a smaller mean increase in physical distress score than the control group at 2, 4, 6, and 7 days after TAE (34.7 vs 50.2, 20.9 vs 29.6, 10.6 vs 18.2, 3.9 vs 11.2, all p < 0.05).

1193,Comparison of the burdens of family caregivers and foreign paid caregivers of the individuals with dementia,"Background: The caregiver burden on foreign paid caregivers (FPCs) is currently not well understood. This study identified predictors and differences in caregiver burden between FPCs and family caregivers who provided care for patients with dementia. Methods: We recruited 489 patients with dementia (diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition) and used the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale to assess their neuropsychiatric behavioral problems and severity of dementia. All caregivers [FPCs (n = 42) and family caregivers with (n = 42) and without (n = 447) FPCs] completed three questionnaires: the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and caregivers' knowledge of dementia (KD). To understand caregiver burden, we analyzed the correlations between ZBI and other variables and investigated the differences between family caregivers and FPCs. Results: NPI and CDR scores were higher among patients assisted by FPCs than among those whose families did not employ FPCs. Burdens were greater among family caregivers assisted by FPCs than among FPCs and family caregivers who were not assisted by FPCs. Family caregivers had greater knowledge of dementia than did FPCs. For family caregivers, CES-D scores (Spearman's r = 0.650; p < 0.01) and patients' NPI scores (Spearman's r = 0.471; p < 0.01) were correlated with caregiver burden. For FPCs, only CES-D scores (Spearman's r = 0.511; p < 0.01) were correlated with caregiver burden. A linear regression model showed that CES-D scores contributed most to caregiver burden in all groups [Î² = 0.560 (family caregivers without FPCs), 0.546 (family caregivers with FPCs), and 0.583 (FPCs); p < 0.005]. Conclusion: Both family caregivers and FPCs need emotional support. Adequate treatment to reduce the neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with dementia might reduce the burden on family caregivers.

1194,An 8-week stress management program in pathological gamblers: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"Stress plays a major role at the onset and relapse of pathological gambling (PG), but at the same time it can also be the aftermath of gambling behavior, thus revealing a reciprocal relationship. Although the role of stress has been well-documented, there is a paucity of studies investigating the effect of an adjunctive stress management program on PG. In this 8-week parallel randomized waitlist controlled trial pathological gamblers, already in the gamblers anonymous (GA) group, were assigned randomly in two groups, with the intervention group (n = 22) receiving an additional stress management program (consisting of education on diet and exercise, stress coping methods, relaxation breathing -RB- and progressive muscle relaxation -PMR). Self-reported measures were used in order to evaluate stress, depression, anxiety, sleep quality/disturbances, life-satisfaction and daily routine. The statistical analyses for the between group differences concerning the main psychosocial study outcomes revealed a statistically significant amelioration of stress, depression, anxiety symptoms and an increase of life-satisfaction and a better daily routine in participants of the intervention group. We hope that these will encourage researchers and clinicians to adopt stress management in their future work. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To that end, we examined demographic and clinical process data from 2,684 veterans who scored positive on a mental health screen. We investigated this data set for patterns and possible predictors of mental health referral acceptance and attendance. The majority of patients had not received mental health treatment within the last two years (76%). Veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) were more likely to accept a mental health referral for depression but were equally likely to attend a mental health visit as other era veterans. Decreased acceptance was associated with provider type and contact method, clinic location, depression only, and specific age ranges (65-74). Among those who accepted a referral, decreased attendance was associated with clinic location, depression only, and retirement. No variables predicted OEF/OIF acceptance/attendance. In conclusion, our findings illustrate the importance of close, continual monitoring of clinical process data to help reveal targets for improving mental health care for veterans.","Lindley, Steven; Cacciapaglia, Holly; Noronha, Delilah; Carlson, Eve; Schatzberg, Alan",0,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05692.x,914

Both conditions received a 6min stretching exercise program that included an orientation and three work-related musculoskeletal disorder (WMSD) educational classes. Between educational classes, the enhanced stretching exercise condition also received mobile phone text messaging and telephone counseling to increase self-efficacy (confidence in overcoming barriers) and provide social support. Flexibility, muscle strength, musculoskeletal symptoms, and acculturative stress were assessed at baseline and 12 weeks.ResultsSignificant increase in flexibility was noted for both conditions, but acculturative stress was significantly reduced only in the standard intervention condition. Muscle strength and WMSD symptoms had no significant changes at the 12 week follow up in both conditions.ConclusionThe 12 week, self-managed, community-based, stretching exercise program was effective to increase flexibility. The standard stretching intervention without any enhancements may be a more cost-effective way to increase flexibility. Longitudinal studies, however, are needed to see if the long-term effects are greater in the enhanced intervention for the migrant worker population.","Lee, Hyeonkyeong; Chae, Duckhee; Wilbur, JoEllen; Miller, Arlene; Lee, Kyongeun; Jin, Hwaeun",1,10.1111/jjns.12010,915
1198,Better sleep in a strange bed? Sleep quality in South African women with posttraumatic stress disorder,"Although individuals diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) regularly report subjective sleep disruption, many studies using objective measures (e.g., polysomnography) report no PTSD-related sleep disruption. To account for these inconsistencies, some authors hypothesize that PTSD-diagnosed individuals have sleep-state misperception; that is, they self-report experiencing poor sleep quality, but objectively sleep relatively normally. We tested this sleep-state misperception hypothesis, collecting data on subjectively-reported sleep quality (in the home,and in the laboratory) and on objectively-measured, laboratory-based, sleep quality in PTSD-diagnosed participants from low socioeconomic status South African communities. Women with PTSD (n = 21), with trauma exposure but no PTSD (TE; n = 19), and healthy controls (HC; n = 20) completed questionnaires on their average sleep quality in the past 30 days, and on their sleep quality after a night (8 h) of polysomnographic-monitored sleep in the laboratory. PTSD-diagnosed individuals reported poorer everyday subjective sleep quality than TE and HC individuals. In the laboratory, however, there were no between-group differences in subjective sleep quality, and few between-group differences in objective sleep quality (PTSD-diagnosed individuals only had decreased sleep depth). Furthermore, whereas measures of laboratory-based objective and subjective sleep quality correlated significantly, especially in PTSD-diagnosed individuals, there were few significant associations between objective sleep measures and everyday subjective sleep quality. Taken together, these findings suggest that PTSD-diagnosed individuals likely experienced better sleep quality in the laboratory than at home. Descriptive observations corroborated this interpretation, with almost half the sample rating their laboratory sleep (which they described as ""safe"" and ""quiet"") as better than their home sleep (which was experienced in an atmosphere marked by high levels of violence and nighttime noise). These findings disconfirm the sleep-state misperception hypothesis as related to PTSD, and suggest that the laboratory environment may influence sleep quality positively in these individuals. Many investigations of sleep in PTSD do not consider the influence of the laboratory environment. Our findings suggest that future studies in this field should consider that sleep-state misperception may be an artifact of the laboratory setting, especially when samples are drawn from communities where violence and crime are an everyday reality.

1199,Early intervention for trauma: Current status and future directions,"Although psychological debriefing (PD) represents the most common form of early intervention for recently traumatized people, there is little evidence supporting its continued use with individuals who experience severe trauma. This review identifies the core issues in early intervention that need to be addressed in resolving the debate over PD. It critiques the available evidence for PD and the early provision of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Based on available evidence, we propose that psychological first aid is an appropriate initial intervention, but that it does not serve a therapeutic or preventive function. When feasible, initial screening is required so that preventive interventions can be used for those individuals who may have difficulty recovering on their own. Evidence-based CBT approaches are indicated for people who are at risk of developing posttraumatic psychopathology. Guidelines for managing acutely traumatized people are suggested and standards are proposed to direct future research that may advance our understanding of the role of early intervention in facilitating adaptation to trauma.

1200,"Early health risk factors for violence: Conceptualization, evidence, and implications","Violence and aggression are public health problems that can benefit from ongoing research into risk reduction and prevention. Current developmental theories of violence and aggression emphasize biological and psychosocial factors, particularly during adolescence. However, there has been less focus on understanding the interactive, multiplicative effects of these processes. Furthermore, little attention has been given to the pre-, peri-, and postnatal periods, where prevention and intervention may yield effective results. Early health risk factors that influence negative behavioral outcomes include prenatal and postnatal nutrition, tobacco use during pregnancy, maternal depression, birth complications, traumatic brain injury, lead exposure, and child abuse. There is an ample literature to suggest that these early health risk factors may increase the likelihood of childhood externalizing behaviors, aggression, juvenile delinquency, adult criminal behavior, and/or violence. This paper proposes an early health risk factors framework for violence prediction, built on existing developmental theories of criminal behavior and supported by empirical findings. This framework addresses gaps in the adolescent psychopathology literature and presents a novel conceptualization of behavioral disturbance that emphasizes the pre-, peri-, and post-natal periods, when a child's development is critical and the opportunity for behavioral and environmental modification is high. Implications for such a framework on violence prevention programs are discussed. Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Liu J.,0,10.1016/j.avb.2010.12.003,918
1201,The microbiome as a novel paradigm in studying stress and mental health,"At the intersection between neuroscience, microbiology, and psychiatry, the enteric microbiome has potential to become a novel paradigm for studying the psychobiological underpinnings of mental illness. Several studies provide support for the view that the enteric microbiome influences behavior through the microbiota- gut- brain axis. Moreover, recent findings are suggestive of the possibility that dysregulation of the enteric microbiota (i.e., dysbiosis) and associated bacterial translocation across the intestinal epithelium may be involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders, particularly depression. The current article reviews preliminary evidence linking the enteric microbiota and its metabolites to psychiatric illness, along with separate lines of empirical inquiry on the potential involvement of psychosocial stressors, proinflammatory cytokines and neuroinflammation, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and vagal nerve activation, respectively, in this relationship. Finally, and drawing on these independent lines of research, an integrative conceptual model is proposed in which stress-induced enteric dysbiosis and intestinal permeability confer risk for negative mental health outcomes through immunoregulatory, endocrinal, and neural pathways.

1202,The Effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Adolescent Mental Health: Swedish and Australian Pilot Outcomes,"Depression, anxiety and stress are common problems among adolescents. Teaching young people coping strategies in school-based intervention programs is one promising approach hoped to remedy the negative consequences of distress in adolescence. The aim of the two pilot studies was to examine the effect of a brief intervention based on the principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) on depressive symptomatology (Australian study, NÂ =Â 66) and stress (Swedish study, NÂ =Â 32) among adolescents screened for psychosocial problems in school settings. In both studies, subjects were assigned to receive the ACT-group-intervention, or a control intervention featuring individual support from the school health care. The Australian study was a planned comparison, with random allocation for girls, plus one replication of a boys group. The Swedish study used a randomized controlled design. The ACT-intervention was an 8-session manualized group program. The Australian study showed significant reductions in depressive symptoms with a large effect, and significant reductions in psychological inflexibility with a medium effect when compared to the control group who received standard care. In the Swedish study, the ACT-intervention group, when compared to the control group, reported significantly lower levels of stress with a large effect size, and marginally significant decrease of anxiety, and marginally significant increased mindfulness skills. Taken together, the ACT-intervention seems to be a promising intervention for reducing stress and depressive symptoms among young adolescents in school and should be tested in full-sized studies. Limitations of these two pilots include small samples.

1203,Presidential address: Psychosomatic medicine and biodefense preparedness - A new role for the American Psychosomatic Society,"Biodefense preparations in the United States have focused mostly on improving biosurveillance and hospital surge capacity in the event of an outbreak or a weapons of mass destruction (WMD) event. However, what if an invisible bioweapon or dirty bomb was released in a major population center, or if avian flu took hold with sustained human to human transmission? Suddenly, we need to combine efforts from psychosomatic medicine and general medicine with public health practice to triage nonexposed patients with somatic symptoms from those with medical sequelae resulting from hazardous exposures. This would better enable the limited acute care resources to be directed to those most in need of urgent medical care. Furthermore, psychosomatic medicine experts are potentially important players in biodefense planning related to risk communication and health education strategies in a WMD scenario or outbreak in which individuals must make informed choices about their need for immediate medical attention.

1206,Stress prevention and stress management in childhood and adolescence,"This paper provides an overview about research activities related to stress in children and adolescents at the University of Bielefeld. In this context, two stress prevention programs related to (a) elementary school children and (b) adolescents of grades 8 and 9 were developed and evaluated. The program evaluations compared different program versions and showed favourable results for problem solving, while program versions focusing on relaxation training were less effective. This was the reason to evaluate the effects of relaxation training in children and adolescents more systematically. Different relaxation techniques were compared with providing non-tension producing stories to children and adolescents. The results showed clear short-term effects of relaxation training although this effect was also produced by non-tension producing stories. The use of additional e-learning units is addressed in the final parts of the paper as a way of increasing the motivation of adolescents to participate in stress prevention training.","Lohaus, A",0,10.1026/0943-8149.16.3.143,922

Participants were randomized to receive SSMT (n = 106) or usual care (UCO) (n = 113). The primary outcome-QOL (SF-36) and secondary outcomes depression (CES-D), and anxiety (STAI) were assessed longitudinally over four chemotherapy cycles. Acculturation (BAS) and patients' intervention adherence were assessed. About 63% of participants reported distress after the initial chemotherapy cycle. Hispanics with lower acculturation reported greater STAI-Trait scores (p = .003). No significant treatment effects on outcomes measures were observed for participants receiving SSMT. SSMT intervention techniques were reported useful and improved mental health scores were observed with patients on a psychotropic agent (p = .04). Hispanics experience an elevated level of distress, yet SSMT did not significantly improve primary outcomes. SSMT may be potentially effective when combined with a psychotropic agent. SSMT enhancing strategies are discussed.","Loi, CXA; Nesman, TM; Xu, P; Taylor, TR; McMillan, S; Krischer, JP; Tyc, VL; Gross-King, M; Huegel, V",0,10.1007/s10903-016-0524-x,923
1208,Prevalence and correlates of smoking status among Veterans Affairs primary care patients with probable Major Depressive Disorder,"In an attempt to guide planning and optimize outcomes for population-specific smoking cessation efforts, the present study examined smoking prevalence and the demographic, clinical and psychosocial characteristics associated with smoking among a sample of Veterans Affairs primary care patients with probable major depression. Survey data were collected between 2003 and 2004 from 761 patients with probable major depression who attended one of 10 geographically dispersed VA primary care clinics. Current smoking prevalence was 39.8%. Relative to nonsmokers with probable major depression, bivariate comparisons revealed that current smokers had higher depression severity, drank more heavily, and were more likely to have comorbid PTSD. Smokers with probable major depression were also more likely than nonsmokers with probable major depression to have missed a health care appointment and to have missed medication doses in the previous 5. months. Smokers were more amenable than non-smokers to depression treatment and diagnosis, and they reported more frequent visits to a mental health specialist and less social support. Alcohol abuse and low levels of social support were significant concurrent predictors of smoking status in controlled multivariable logistic regression. In conclusion, smoking prevalence was high among primary care patients with probable major depression, and these smokers reported a range of psychiatric and psychosocial characteristics with potential to complicate systems-level smoking cessation interventions.

1209,Preliminary evidence for the feasibility of a stress management intervention for 7- to 12-year-olds with asthma,"Objective. Evidence supports a bidirectional relationship between stress and asthma exacerbations in children, suggesting that interventions to reduce stress may improve both psychosocial quality of life and disease course. Here, we examine the feasibility of a stress management intervention for 7- to 12-year-olds with asthma. Methods. Two trials were conducted. Cohort 1 (n = 11) was recruited from the community and attended intervention sessions at an urban university. Cohort 2 (n = 7) was school based and recruited from an African American charter school. Six individual intervention sessions focused on psychoeducation about asthma, stress, and emotions; problem-solving and coping skills training; and relaxation training paired with physiological feedback. Pre- and post-intervention stress, mood, and lung function data were collected. Satisfaction surveys were administered after intervention completion. Results. The intervention was rated as highly acceptable by participating families. Feasibility was much stronger for the school-based than the university-based recruitment mechanism. Initial efficacy data suggest that both cohorts showed pre- to post-intervention improvements in lung function, perceived stress, and depressed mood. Conclusion. Findings provide evidence for the feasibility of offering asthma-related stress management training in a school setting. Initial findings offer support for future, large-scale efficacy studies.

1213,Stress management and resilience training (SMART) program to decrease stress and enhance resilience among breast cancer survivors: A pilot randomized clinical trial,"Introduction: Patients with breast cancer experience stress and anxiety related to their diagnosis, with resulting lower quality of life. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a SMART (Stress Management and Resiliency Training) program for increasing resiliency and for decreasing stress and anxiety among mentors who themselves were previously diagnosed with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: The program consisted of two 90-minute group training sessions, a brief individual session, and 3 follow-up telephone calls. Twenty-four mentors at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, were randomized in a single-blind, wait-list controlled clinical trial to either the SMART intervention or a control group for 12 weeks. Primary outcome measures assessed at baseline and at week 12 included the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, Smith Anxiety Scale, and Linear Analog Self Assessment Scale. Results: Twenty patients completed the study. A statistically significant improvement in resilience, perceived stress, anxiety, and overall quality of life at 12 weeks, compared with baseline was observed in the study arm. No significant difference in any of these measures was noted in the control group. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a brief, predominantly group-based resilience training intervention is feasible in patients with previous breast cancer; also, it may be efficacious.

1214,Exploring the links between physical activity and posttraumatic growth in young adult cancer survivors,"Objective: Set within a posttraumatic growth (PTG) framework, the purpose of this investigation was to explore social support and enduring distress as predictors of psychological growth. The moderating role of physical activity was also examined. Method: Sixty-four young adult cancer survivors (M age=28.83, SD=5.5 years) completed a survey assessing constructs within the PTG model, cancer and personal descriptive, and physical activity. Results: In a hierarchical regression analysis, stress (Î²=-0.04) and social support (Î²=0.46) were significant predictors of psychological growth (R2=0.24). The physical activity by social support interaction accounted for an additional 12.8% of the variance (Î²=-0.52), suggesting a strong positive correlation between social support and psychological growth in inactive individuals and a much weaker correlation for active individuals. Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance for young adult cancer survivors to seek social support, adopt appropriate coping strategies to endure distress, and to engage in regular physical activity to foster experiences of psychological growth following diagnosis and treatment for cancer.

1215,Psychosocial factors in the development of heart disease in women: Current research and future directions,"To review the recent (1995-2009) literature on psychosocial risk and protective factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) among women, including negative emotions, stress, social relationships, and positive psychological factors. Methods: Articles for the review were identified using PubMed and bibliographies of relevant articles. Eligible studies included at least 100 women and either focused on a) exclusively female participants or b) both men and women, conducting either gender-stratified analyses or examining interactions with gender. Sixty-seven published reports were identified that examined prospective associations with incident or recurrent CHD. Results: In general, evidence suggests that depression, anxiety disorders, anger suppression, and stress associated with relationships or family responsibilities are associated with elevated CHD risk among women, that supportive social relationships and positive psychological factors may be associated with reduced risk, and that general anxiety, hostility, and work-related stress are less consistently associated with CHD among women relative to men. Conclusions: A growing literature supports the significance of psychosocial factors for the development of CHD among women. Consideration of both traditional psychosocial factors (e.g., depression) and factors that may be especially important for women (e.g., stress associated with responsibilities at home or multiple roles) may improve identification of women at elevated risk as well as the development of effective psychological interventions for women with or at risk for CHD.

The study presented here explored whether staff perceptions about the organizational capacity of their treatment unit are also associated with staff experience of barriers to implementing EBPs. Multivariate regression methods examined the relationship between the clinical staff (n = 510) and director (n = 296) perceptions of organizational capacity (Texas Christian University Organizational Readiness for Change [TCU ORC]-staff and TCU ORC-director) and level of barriers experienced when implementing a new EBP controlling for a range of treatment unit characteristics, staff characteristics, and type of EBP implemented. For both samples, reporting higher levels of stress in their organizations was significantly associated with reporting higher levels of barriers when implementing a new EBP. For clinical staff only, experiencing lower levels of program needs in their organization, working in a program that had been in existence for a shorter period, and implementing motivational interviewing techniques compared with other EBPs were all factors significantly associated with experiencing lower levels of barriers with EBP implementation.

1218,Resource loss predicts depression and anxiety among patients treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator,"OBJECTIVE: Many patients treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) experience clinically significant depression and anxiety after ICD implantation. As ICD use continues to evolve, it is important to understand the correlates of depression and anxiety to identify patients at greatest risk of poor psychological functioning. Conservation of resources theory, a general theory of stress, states that people experience greater stress if they perceive that they are losing personal, social, and material resources. We hypothesized that perceptions of resource loss would be related to symptoms of depression and anxiety after controlling for other known predictors. METHODS: One hundred patients treated with an ICD completed standardized depression and anxiety questionnaires along with questionnaires assessing social support, physical functioning, and resource loss. Clinical variables for patients were obtained from prospectively obtained medical records. RESULTS: Over 20% of the sample exhibited elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety. Patients' depression levels were associated with poor social support, poor physical functioning, a history of depression, and a greater length of time since ICD implantation. Having experienced one or more clinical ICD shocks was related to depression but not anxiety. Higher levels of perceived resource loss were associated with higher levels of both depression and anxiety after controlling for all other predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Resource loss may help to determine psychological distress after ICD implantation. Understanding how resource loss contributes to depression and anxiety may help to identify patients at greatest risk of poor psychological functioning and may suggest treatment strategies.

1221,"Influence of Acute Multispecies and Multistrain Probiotic Supplementation on Cardiovascular Function and Reactivity to Psychological Stress in Young Adults: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial","Objective The potential influence of probiotic supplementation on cardiovascular health and stress responsivity remains largely unexplored. Some evidence suggests the possibility that probiotics may influence blood pressure. A separate body of research suggests that exaggerated cardiovascular reactions to acute psychological stress in the laboratory predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The current investigation explored the effect of acute probiotic use on (1) resting cardiovascular measures in healthy young adults and (2) cardiovascular and psychological reactions to an acute psychological stressor in the laboratory. Method Participants (N = 105, M [SD] age = 20.17 [1.26], 84.8% white) completed a 2-week, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial of a multispecies and multistrain probiotic. Exclusion criteria included previous probiotic use, diagnosed gastrointestinal disorder, and/or current antibiotic use. At visits 1 and 2, participants completed the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, a widely used psychological stress task. Participants were randomly assigned to a probiotic blend or matched placebo. Results Compared with placebo, 2-week probiotic supplementation did not affect resting measures of cardiovascular function, cardiovascular responses during or recovery from stress, or psychological reactions to acute psychological stress. Conclusions Contrary to expectations, short-term use of a probiotic supplement in healthy participants did not influence measures of cardiovascular function or responsivity to psychological stress. Future research is needed to determine species- and strain-specific effects of probiotics in healthy participants with various degrees of stress responsiveness, as well as in diseased populations.

1222,Effects of a behavioral intervention on treatment adherence and stress management in adolescents with IDDM,"OBJECTIVE - To evaluate the effects of a behavioral program to increase treatment adherence and to improve stress management in adolescents with IDDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design with a nonequivalent control group was used. Eighteen subjects were assigned to the experimental group, which received the program, while nineteen subjects made up the control group, which received routine medical care. During the 12 intervention sessions with diabetic adolescents, different procedures were applied: instruction, blood glucose discrimination training, role-playing, relaxation exercises, self-instructions, problem- solving strategies, and homework, among others. RESULTS - The results show significant changes in the experimental group in variables related to diabetes: information (patients and their parents), adherence, daily hassles, uneasiness and likelihood of response in social interactions, skills and frequency of glycemic analyses, blood glucose estimate errors, and negative family support (parents). The program had no effect on either dietary and physical exercise or glycemic control. The improvements, which were maintained at a follow-up carried out 13 months after finishing the program, were: patients' information about physiopathology (P = 0.000), diet (P = 0.000), physical exercise (P = 0.048), glucose testing (P = 0.030), and insulin (P = 0.000), barriers to adherence frequency (P = 0.000), severity of daily hassles (P = 0.006), and degree of uneasiness in social interaction (P = 0.000). CONCLUSIONS - This research introduces the novelty of integrating several behavioral procedures within a wide-ranging package that affects aspects implied in diabetes control such as treatment adherence and stress management. The testing of similar programs on samples of subjects with glycemic control difficulties would be useful.","MÃ©ndez F.J., BelÃ©ndez M.",0,10.2337/diacare.20.9.1370,933

Short-andmedium-termeffectiveness (up to 3 years) of individual level stressmanagement interventions (SMI) at work were demonstrated, yet long-term effectiveness remains unexplored. We therefore aimed to address this research gap. Methods. 94 male middle managers participated in a randomized wait-list controlled trial between 2006 and 2008 and in a post-trial-followup survey in 2015. During the first two years, all received an 18-hour psychotherapeutic SMI intervention which was based on the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) model: tackling stressor on mismatch between effort and reward and promoting recovery on overcommitment. Work stress (i.e., ERI indicators) was the primary outcome, and the secondary outcome was depressive symptoms. The long-term effectiveness of the SMI was examined by mixed modeling, using an external control group (p = 94). Results. Effort and reward were substantially improved with significant intervention * time interaction effects (p < 0.001) compared to the external control group; effects on overcommitment and depressive symptoms were also significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, resp.), though their trajectories in the intervention group were less sustainable.

1225,Differentiation of Self: Enhancing Therapist Resilience When Working with Relational Trauma,"Clinicians are charged with being diligent in gaining competency in the latest trauma-informed interventions when working with relational trauma. This may invest therapists with an overresponsibility that is not only overwhelming and unrealistic, but serves to reduce autonomous functioning in family members. Therefore, clinicians need to become clear about what they are responsible for and what they are not, particularly when family members present as irresponsible or too anxious to think and act more effectively. Using a case vignette, this paper discusses how a clinician's focus on increasing their differentiation of self, a concept embeded in Bowen family systems theory, protects against vicarious traumatisation, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout whilst contributing to more autonomous functioning and better wellbeing outcomes for both clinicians and clients alike.

After the age of 30 years, about 80% of people will have a low back pain crisis, immobilizing them from a few to many days. Each year more man-hours are lost due to CLBP than any other condition and 25% of the patients visiting the orthopedic outpatients clinics suffer from low back pain. METHOD This trial included patients, in random order, who visited the Outpatients Clinics of the Orthopedic Department in â€œAndreas Papandreouâ€ General Hospital, Rhodes, Greece, in the Second Administrative Health Region of the South Aegean, with low back pain. They participated in this randomized clinical trial (RCT) voluntarily after giving their written informed consent. Stress management techniques, including diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided visualization and autogenic training were implemented in the intervention group (n=30). The follow-up was 8 weeks. Self-reported validated measurements of stress assessment were used aimed at valuating the perceived stress, lifestyle modifications and pain. The intervention group filled in a daily log of implementation of the relaxation techniques. The follow-up was 8 weeks. RESULTS The percentage of people reporting that they feel extra pain on the day of filling in the questionnaire was lower at the end (10.0%) than at the start of the trial (23.3%, p<0.001). In the intervention group, an increase was observed in the routine scores in total and specifically increases were observed in the scores of the SF-36 questionnaire on quality of life (higher values show better condition) and, in particular, for physical functionality. An overall decrease was observed in the reported stress level, perceived stress (PSS-14), the total score of symptoms and the â€œchanceâ€ health control center. CONCLUSIONS It is imperative to carry out further such studies, incorporated in more objective laboratory trials. Trials need to be carried out extending these first conclusions on the favorable effects of stress control on CLBP and examining other similar techniques, with more objective measurement of the stress levels, using biomarkers.

1230,Propranolol's impact on cognitive performance in post-traumatic stress disorder,"Background Propranolol has effectively diminished fear-based emotional memories in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and this effect has been attributed to traumatic memory reconsolidation blockade. However, propranolol may also exert cognitive effects by modulating stress and arousal. Method Within a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial, propranolol's impact on cognitive functioning was examined in individuals who were diagnosed with chronic PTSD. Participants received a single dose of 1 mg/kg of propranolol (n=20) or placebo (n=21), and completed subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale third edition (WAIS-III). PTSD symptoms were assessed 1 week before and after treatment by the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R). Results The propranolol group performed significantly better on the Processing Speed composite measure compared to the placebo group. Furthermore, greater heart rate decreases were associated with higher Perceptual Organization performance, within the propranolol group. Limitations The generalizability of results may have been reduced as participants were treatment seeking; the sample size was small and included a greater proportion of females.This study could not assess whether pre-existing psychological function influenced cognitive performance, post-trauma. Future studies might consider including a non-PTSD control group to determine if our findings are specific to propranolol's effect on PTSD associated cognitive impairment. Conclusions Our preliminary results demonstrated that cognitive functioning improved following propranolol administration in PTSD patients. The implications are discussed with regards to the processing of traumatic events. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

1231,"The Effects of Office Ergonomic Training on Musculoskeletal Complaints, Sickness Absence, and Psychological Well-Being: A Cluster Randomized Control Trial","This study explored whether musculoskeletal complaints can be reduced by the provision of ergonomics education. A cluster randomized controlled trial study was conducted in which 3 units were randomized to intervention and received training and 3 units were given a leaflet. The effect of intervention on knowledge, workstation practices, musculoskeletal complaints, sickness absence, and psychological well-being were assessed at 6 and 12 months. Although there was no increment of knowledge among workers, significant improvements in workstation practices in the use of monitor, keyboard, and chair were observed. There were significant reductions in neck and upper and lower back complaints among workers but these did not translate into fewer days lost from work. Workers' stress was found to be significantly reduced across the studies. In conclusion, office ergonomics training can be beneficial in reducing musculoskeletal risks and stress among workers.","Mahmud, Norashikin; Kenny, Dianna T.; Zein, Raemy Md; Hassan, Siti Nurani",0,10.1177/1010539511419199,940
1232,Mindfulness-based interventions for chronic pain: Evidence and applications,"Chronic pain is estimated to occur in from 5.5% to 33% of the world's adult population (Gureje et al., 1998). Chronic pain is frequently treated with opiates, which has produced an opiate addiction crisis (Dowell et al., 2016). Several non-pharmacological treatment alternatives can help manage chronic pain. There is moderate evidence that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) such as meditation, yoga, and stress reduction lower the perception of pain, increase mobility, improve functioning and well-being. By integrating MBIs and other therapeutic interventions in a multi-disciplinary pain management plan, clinicians can improve treatment outcomes and potentially decrease pain-related medication utilization.

1233,Stress management interventions in the workplace improve stress reactivity: A randomised controlled trial,"Objective: To examine the long-term effects of a stress management intervention (SMI) based on the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model, on psychological and biological reactions to work stress. Methods: 174 lower or middle management employees (99% male) were randomly assigned to an intervention or a waiting control group. The programme comprised 24X45 min group sessions (2 full days followed by two 4X45 min sessions within the next 8 months) on individual work stress situations. The primary endpoint was perceived stress reactivity (Stress Reactivity Scale, SRS), while secondary endpoints were salivary cortisol and a-amylase, anxiety and depression, and ERI. Assessments were repeated in 154 participants 1 year later. Results: SRS score decreased in both groups. A twofactor ANOVA with repeated measures showed a significant timeXgroup effect (F=5.932; p=0.016) with the greater reduction in the intervention group. For SRS, the effect size (Cohen's d) after 1 year was d=0.416 in the intervention and d=0.166 in the control group. Î±-Amylase as a measure of sympathetic nervous system activation, decreased more strongly in the intervention group (area under the daytime curve and daytime slope: timeXgroup effect p=0.076 and p=0.075). No difference was observed for cortisol. For depression, anxiety and ERI, improvements were higher in the intervention group but did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: SMI based on work stress theory, is effective in reducing perceived stress reactivity and sympathetic activation in lower and middle management employees. Other mental health parameters and ERI show a tendency towards improvement. These beneficial effects are present 1 year later.","Limm H., GÃ¼ndel H., HeinmÃ¼ller M., Marten-Mittag B., Nater U.M., Siegrist J., Angerer P.",1,10.1136/oem.2009.054148,942
1234,Impact of TBI on caregivers of veterans with TBI: Burden and interventions,"Objectives: Describe State-of-the-Art in practice and research in caregiving with individuals, specifically, Veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the implications for current practice and future research.Sources: Professional literature and personal experience of review panel.Main Outcomes: Unpaid caregiving for individuals with TBI is most often provided by a spouse, parent or other blood relative; the majority of caregivers are women. Although caregiving can be rewarding, it also may create financial burden and psychological stress. Depression among family caregivers occurs four times more frequently than in the general population. Positive coping can help reduce the impact of stress, and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) programmes are available to ease financial burden. Group interventions show promise in reinforcing and improving positive coping for both family caregivers and Veterans with TBI.Conclusions: Identifying the specific needs of caregivers and families of Veterans with TBI and other traumatic injuries, including post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD), will require further longitudinal research. Currently available group interventions and programmes appear to benefit injured Veterans and their family caregivers financially and psychologically. Increased understanding of characteristics of quality family caregiving and its long term costs and benefits is likely to lead to additional improvements in these interventions and programmes.","Malec, James F.; Van Houtven, Courtney Harold; Tanielian, Terri; Atizado, Adrian; Dorn, Michael C.",0,10.1080/02699052.2016.1274778,943

A survey was administered to 1005 caregivers of children with autism in Pennsylvania. Two-thirds of respondents (66.4%) had ever participated in an autism-specific support group. In adjusted analyses, demographic characteristics, including age and sex of the child, ethnicity and parental education and income, were associated with support group participation. Parents of children with self-injurious behavior, sleep problems or severe language deficits were more likely to belong, as were parents whose diagnosing clinician referred them to a support group. The results of this study suggest the importance of clinician referrals to groups, and the need to make groups available to under-served populations.

1237,"Pharmacological and Psychosocial Management of Mental, Neurological and Substance Use Disorders in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Issues and Current Strategies","Mental, neurological, and substance use disorders (MNS) are among the largest sources of medical disability in the world, surpassing both cardiovascular disease and cancer. The picture is not different in low- and middle-income countries (LAMIC) where the relative morbidity associated with MNS is increasing, as a consequence of improvement in general health indicators and longevity. However, 80 % of individuals with MNS live in LAMIC but only close to 20 % of cases receive some sort of treatment. The main aim of this article is to provide non-specialist health workers in LAMIC with an accessible guide to the affordable essential psychotropics and psychosocial interventions which are proven to be cost effective for treating the main MNS.The MNS discussed in this article were selected on the basis of burden, following the key priority conditions selected by the Mental Health Action Programme (mhGAP) developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) (anxiety, stress-related and bodily distress disorders; depression and bipolar disorder; schizophrenia; alcohol and drug addiction; and epilepsy), with the addition of eating disorders, because of their emergent trend in middle-income countries. We review best evidence-based clinical practice in these areas, with a focus on drugs from the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and the psychosocial interventions available in LAMIC for the management of these conditions in primary care. We do this by reviewing guidelines developed by prestigious professional associations and government agencies, clinical trials conducted in LAMIC and systematic reviews (including Cochrane reviews) identified from the main international literature databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO).In summary, it can be concluded that the availability and use of the psychotropics on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines in LAMIC, plus an array of psychosocial interventions, can represent a cost-effective way to expand treatment of most MNS. The translation of these findings into policies can be achieved by relatively low supplementary funding, and limited effort engendered by governments and policy makers in LAMIC.In summary, it can be concluded that the availability and use of the psychotropics on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines in LAMIC, plus an array of psychosocial interventions, can represent a cost-effective way to expand treatment of most MNS.

1238,A pilot trial of a stress management intervention for primary caregivers of children newly diagnosed with cancer: Preliminary evidence that perceived social support moderates the psychosocial benefit of intervention,"Objectives (1) To examine the acceptability and feasibility of a stress management intervention for caregivers of children recently diagnosed with cancer. (2) To explore whether caregivers with lower baseline perceived social support derive greater benefit from the intervention than those with higher perceived support. Methods 45 primary caregivers were randomly assigned to intervention or standard care. Of these, 37 completed measures of social support, depression, anxiety, and perceived stress at both pre-intervention (T1; mean = 24 days post-diagnosis) and post-intervention time points (T2; mean = 165 days post-diagnosis). Results Enrollment, retention, and satisfaction data support feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. There was no overall significant impact of participation in the intervention on levels of distress at T2. However, T1 social support moderated intervention response, with caregivers who perceived lower T1 support showing greater psychological benefit from the intervention. Conclusions Primary caregivers with lower levels of perceived social support may benefit from preemptive stress management intervention. Â© 2013 The Author 2013.

1241,Using lifestyle and coping to reduce job stress and improve health in 'at risk' office workers,"This study assessed the effectiveness of an intervention programme which employed previously identified lifestyle and coping strategies to reduce the subjective experience and effects of work-related stress. Employees (104) working in a government tax office with identified stress-related symptoms were randomized to enter an intervention group (52) or a control group (52). Pre- and post-programme questionnaire assessments of work-related stress, coping strategies, physical health and lifestyle as well as physiological assessments (blood pressure and body mass index) were used to evaluate changes following an 8-week programme implementation phase. The programme comprised four weekly workshops on stress and lifestyle education as well as stress-coping skills training, followed by individual counselling sessions and a personalized action plan. Control group members were offered the same programme after post-programme assessment. There were no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups for stress and health indicators at post-programme. A 12-week post-intervention follow-up showed reductions in perceived workplace (p < 0.01) and home/work (p = 0.05) stress. The data suggest that relatively short inter ventions with individual follow-up can reduce perceptions of stress even where workplace stressors have not changed.

1243,A Cluster Randomized Trial of Interventions to Improve Work Conditions and Clinician Burnout in Primary Care: Results from the Healthy Work Place (HWP) Study,"Work conditions in primary care are associated with physician burnout and lower quality of care.We aimed to assess if improvements in work conditions improve clinician stress and burnout.Primary care clinicians at 34 clinics in the upper Midwest and New York City participated in the study.This was a cluster randomized controlled trial.Work conditions, such as time pressure, workplace chaos, and work control, as well as clinician outcomes, were measured at baseline and at 12-18 months. A brief worklife and work conditions summary measure was provided to staff and clinicians at intervention sites.Diverse interventions were grouped into three categories: 1) improved communication; 2) changes in workflow, and 3) targeted quality improvement (QI) projects.Multilevel regressions assessed impact of worklife data and interventions on clinician outcomes. A multilevel analysis then looked at clinicians whose outcome scores improved and determined types of interventions associated with improvement.Of 166 clinicians, 135 (81.3 %) completed the study. While there was no group treatment effect of baseline data on clinician outcomes, more intervention clinicians showed improvements in burnout (21.8 % vs 7.1 % less burned out, p = 0.01) and satisfaction (23.1 % vs 10.0 % more satisfied, p = 0.04). Burnout was more likely to improve with workflow interventions [Odds Ratio (OR) of improvement in burnout 5.9, p = 0.02], and with targeted QI projects than in controls (OR 4.8, p = 0.02). Interventions in communication or workflow led to greater improvements in clinician satisfaction (OR 3.1, p = 0.04), and showed a trend toward greater improvement in intention to leave (OR 4.2, p = 0.06).We used heterogeneous intervention types, and were uncertain how well interventions were instituted.Organizations may be able to improve burnout, dissatisfaction and retention by addressing communication and workflow, and initiating QI projects targeting clinician concerns.","Linzer, Mark; Poplau, Sara; Grossman, Ellie; Varkey, Anita; Yale, Steven; Williams, Eric; Hicks, Lanis; Brown, Roger L.; Wallock, Jill; Kohnhorst, Diane; Barbouche, Michael",1,10.1007/s11606-015-3235-4,949
1244,Assessment of proprioceptive exercises in the treatment of rotator cuff disorders in nursing professionals: a randomized controlled clinical trial,"Background: Shoulder pain in nursing professionals may lead to limitations in occupational and daily activities and consequently interfere with quality of life. Objective: To compare the effects of two physical therapy programs which differed in the proprioceptive exercises used on the nursing professionals with rotator cuff disorder, according to quality of life, work satisfaction indicators, and pain intensity. Method: This study was an experimental, randomized, prospective, comparative trial with quantitative data analysis. The data sampling was carried out between the months of June 2010 and July 2011 by means of a questionnaire containing socio-demographic and professional information, the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC), the Occupational Stress Indicator (OSI), and the Visual Numeric Scale (VNS). Based on randomization, subjects were divided into two groups. Group 1 (control) was submitted to stretching and strengthening exercises and cryotherapy. Group 2 (experimental) was treated with the same protocol as the control group, with the addition of proprioception exercises. The data was analyzed by means of the Statistical Package for the Social Science version 16.0 for Windows. Results: After physical therapy intervention, significant reduction in pain levels occurred in both groups, with a significant improvement in quality of life for Group 2. No changes were observed in the work satisfaction indicators after the two types of physical therapy interventions. Conclusions: The proprioceptive exercises were important in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders, however the results did not allow us to determine which treatment was the most effective as there was no significant difference between groups.","Martins, Lisandra V.; Marziale, Maria H.

However, comparatively little research has been devoted to addressing how best to remedy this growing problem. We provide an overview of the influence of stress on dietary intake, and then explore the novel, yet simple, possibility that regular elicitation of the relaxation response may effectively reduce stress-induced eating via both physiological neuroendocrine and reward pathways and psychological pathways involving emotion regulation, and habitual coping. If shown to be effective, the regular practice of relaxation may provide a convenient, cost efficient, patient-centered therapeutic practice to assist in the prevention of unhealthy weight gain and other negative consequences of unhealthy food intake.

1247,Reduced reward-driven eating accounts for the impact of a mindfulness-based diet and exercise intervention on weight loss: Data from the SHINE randomized controlled trial,"Many individuals with obesity report over eating despite intentions to maintain or lose weight. Two barriers to long-term weight loss are reward-driven eating, which is characterized by a lack of control over eating, a preoccupation with food, and a lack of satiety; and psychological stress. Mindfulness training may address these barriers by promoting awareness of hunger and satiety cues, self-regulatory control, and stress reduction. We examined these two barriers as potential mediators of weight loss in the Supporting Health by Integrating Nutrition and Exercise (SHINE) randomized controlled trial, which compared the effects of a 5.5-month diet and exercise intervention with or without mindfulness training on weight loss among adults with obesity. Intention-to-treat multiple mediation models tested whether post-intervention reward-driven eating and psychological stress mediated the impact of intervention arm on weight loss at 12- and 18-months post-baseline among 194 adults with obesity (BMI: 30-45). Mindfulness (relative to control) participants had significant reductions in reward-driven eating at 6 months (post-intervention), which, in turn, predicted weight loss at 12 months. Post-intervention reward-driven eating mediated 47.1% of the total intervention arm effect on weight loss at 12 months [Î² = -0.06, SE(Î²) = 0.03, p = .030, 95% CI (-0.12, -0.01)]. This mediated effect was reduced when predicting weight loss at 18 months (p = .396), accounting for 23.0% of the total intervention effect, despite similar weight loss at 12 months. Psychological stress did not mediate the effect of intervention arm on weight loss at 12 or 18 months. In conclusion, reducing reward-driven eating, which can be achieved using a diet and exercise intervention that includes mindfulness training, may promote weight loss (clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT00960414).

1248,"The Still-Face Paradigm and bidirectionality: Associations with maternal sensitivity, self-esteem and infant emotional reactivity","The Still-Face Paradigm (SFP) is a structured stressful event within which researchers have investigated the influence of maternal psychological and behavioral characteristics on infant behavior. The present investigation contributes to this body of work by examining the joint contributions of maternal and child behavioral and affective characteristics on subsequent behaviors and affectations following the SFP. A sample of non-clinically depressed mothers and their infants (n= 31) engaged in a modified Still-Face Paradigm (SFP), followed by a period of toy play. These interactions were videotaped and behaviorally coded along the following dimensions: maternal sensitivity prior to the SFP and during toy play, infant negative emotional reactivity during the still-face, and infant resistance during the reunion phase. Additionally, mothers reported global self-esteem and this was examined as a predictor of infant behavior. Results revealed significant bidirectional influences such that maternal self-esteem predicted infant emotional reactivity, maternal sensitivity pre-SFP predicted infant resistance during the reunion phase, and infant resistance predicted subsequent levels of maternal sensitivity. Indirect effects were also examined, and provided additional support for bidirectionality in mother-infant interactions. Implications for clinical practice are discussed in light of these findings.

However, this low work-related self-efficacy/enhanced SMT benefits effect may be conditional on employees also having high levels of intrinsic work motivation. In the present study, we examined this proposition by testing three-way, or higher order, interaction effects. One hundred and fifty-three U.K. government employees were randomly assigned to a SMT intervention group (n = 68), or to a waiting list control group (n = 85). The SMT group received three half-day training sessions spread over two and a half months. Findings indicated that there were significant overall reductions in psychological strain, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization in the SMT group, in comparison to the control group. Furthermore, there were significant higher order Group (SMT vs. control) Ã— Time 1 Work-Related Self-Efficacy Ã— Time 1 Intrinsic Work Motivation interactions, such that reductions in emotional exhaustion and depersonalization at certain time points were experienced only by those who had low baseline levels of work-related self-efficacy and high baseline levels of intrinsic work motivation.

1251,Disaster management: Mental health perspective,"Disaster mental health is based on the principles of â€²preventive medicineâ€² This principle has necessitated a paradigm shift from relief centered post-disaster management to a holistic, multi-dimensional integrated community approach of health promotion, disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation. This has ignited the paradigm shift from curative to preventive aspects of disaster management. This can be understood on the basis of six â€²Râ€²s such as Readiness (Preparedness), Response (Immediate action), Relief (Sustained rescue work), Rehabilitation (Long term remedial measures using community resources), Recovery (Returning to normalcy) and Resilience (Fostering). Prevalence of mental health problems in disaster affected population is found to be higher by two to three times than that of the general population. Along with the diagnosable mental disorders, affected community also harbours large number of sub-syndromal symptoms. Majority of the acute phase reactions and disorders are self-limiting, whereas long-term phase disorders require assistance from mental health professionals. Role of psychotropic medication is very limited in preventing mental health morbidity. The role of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in mitigating the mental health morbidity appears to be promising. Role of Psychological First Aid (PFA) and debriefing is not well-established. Disaster management is a continuous and integrated cyclical process of planning, organising, coordinating and implementing measures to prevent and to manage disaster effectively. Thus, now it is time to integrate public health principles into disaster mental health.","Math S., Nirmala M., Moirangthem S., Kumar N.",0,10.4103/0253-7176.162915,957

1254,Attenuating posttraumatic distress with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids among disaster medical assistance team members after the Great East Japan Earthquake: The APOP randomized controlled trial,"Background: On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake, the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, and a massive tsunami struck off the coast of the Sanriku region. A Disaster Medical Assistance Team, a mobile medical team with specialized training that is deployed during the acute phase of a disaster, was dispatched to areas with large-scale destruction and multiple injured and sick casualties. Previous studies have reported critical incident stress (i.e. posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and depressive symptoms) among rescue workers as well as the need for screening and prevention for posttraumatic stress disorder. So far we have shown in an open trial that posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in critically injured patients can be reduced by taking omega-3 fatty acids intended to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis.Method/Design: This study is designed to determine the effectiveness of attenuating posttraumatic distress with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids among Disaster Medical Assistance Team members after the Great East Japan Earthquake, and is named the APOP randomized controlled trial which is currently ongoing. First, we will provide psycho-education on posttraumatic distress, which is common in responders to the Disaster Medical Assistance Team members deployed to the disaster area. Second, observational research will be conducted to evaluate critical incident stress following the completion of medical activities. Third, team members who provide consent to participate in the intervention research will be randomly divided into a group given an omega-3 fatty acid supplement and a group not given the supplements. Outcome will be evaluated at 12 weeks after the supplements are shipped to the team members.Discussion: Measures that address critical incident stress in disaster responders are important, but there is no substantial evidence that links such measures with prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder. Thus, any confirmation through this study that the intake of omega-3 fatty acid supplements serves as a simple preventative measure for critical incident stress will be of great significance.Trial registration: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, UMIN000005367","Matsuoka, Yutaka; Nishi, Daisuke; Nakaya, Naoki; Sone, Toshimasa; Hamazaki, Kei; Hamazaki, Tomohito; Koido, Yuichi",0,10.1186/1471-244X-11-132,960

We evaluated men's mortality risk associated with number of different work stressors and marital dissolution during the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT). Methods: Men without definite evidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) at study entry but with above-average risk for CHD mortality based on blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, and/or cigarette smoking were recruited into MRFIT. Survivors at the end of the trial were followed up for mortality for an additional 9 years.

Results: Increasing number of different work stressors and divorce during the trial were associated with total and cardiovascular mortality during the 9-year follow-up period (Psâ‰¤.01 for linear trend), with a relative risk of 1.26 (95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.48) for those reporting 3 or more different work stressors compared with those reporting none, and relative risk of 1.37 (95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.72) for those who divorced compared with those who remained married for total mortality. Analyses were adjusted for age, intervention group, educational attainment, occurrence of a nonfatal cardiovascular event during the trial, smoking, diastolic blood pressure, alcohol consumption, and serum cholesterol level (the last 4 adjustments were trial averages). Conclusion: Work and marital stressors increase risk for mortality in men.","Matthews K.A., Gump B.B.",0,,961
1256,"Association between financial strain, social network and five-year recovery from first episode psychosis","Despite much effort to positively affect long-term outcome in psychosis and schizophrenia many patients are still facing a poor outcome with persistent psychotic symptoms and decline in social functioning. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between financial strain and social network and five-year outcome of first episode psychosis (FEP). FEP patients were divided into recovered (n = 52) and non-recovered (n = 19). Each person was matched according to age and gender with four persons (n = 284) from a longitudinal population-based study. All persons had answered an extensive questionnaire including social network, quantitative and qualitative, financial strain and mental health. Linear regression analysis showed that both financial strain and social network were associated, and had a unique contribution, to outcome. The results indicate that FEP patients might benefit from interventions that reduce financial strain thus facilitating daily life and cultural and social activities.

1257,The effects of mindfulness interventions on prenatal well-being: A systematic review,"Objective: Low well-being during pregnancy can have significant adverse outcomes for mother and child. The effects of mindfulness interventions on prenatal maternal well-being are increasingly examined but outcomes have yet to be systematically evaluated. The aims of the current paper are to systematically evaluate intervention effects and current research approaches with pregnant groups. Design: A systematic review of eight studies examining mindfulness intervention effects on prenatal well-being. Results: Findings indicate potential benefits of mindfulness interventions for reducing levels of depression, anxiety and negative affect during pregnancy. There is also evidence for improved self-compassion and perceived childbirth self-efficacy. Further, these effects may be more pronounced for vulnerable groups, such as women currently experiencing low prenatal well-being. Less consistent findings were observed for stress, and positive affect. Variations in research design, gestational characteristics, timing of assessments and outcome measurement may explain some inconsistencies in the extant literature. Conclusion: Mindfulness interventions present a potentially useful means to improve prenatal well-being but improved methodological quality is essential to rigorously examine intervention effects.

1258,"Systematic Medical Appraisal, Referral and Treatment (SMART) Mental Health Programme for providing innovative mental health care in rural communities in India","Background. India has few mental health professionals to treat the large number of people suffering from mental disorders. Rural areas are particularly disadvantaged due to lack of trained health workers. Ways to improve care could be by training village health workers in basic mental health care, and by using innovative methods of service delivery. The ongoing Systematic Medical Appraisal, Referral and Treatment Mental Health Programme will assess the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a task-shifting mobile-based intervention using mixed methods, in rural Andhra Pradesh, India.Method. The key components of the study are an anti-stigma campaign followed by a mobile-based mental health services intervention. The study will be done across two sites in rural areas, with intervention periods of 1 year and 3 months, respectively. The programme uses a mobile-based clinical decision support tool to be used by non-physician health workers and primary care physicians to screen, diagnose and manage individuals suffering from depression, suicidal risk and emotional stress. The key aim of the study will be to assess any changes in mental health services use among those screened positive following the intervention. A number of other outcomes will also be assessed using mixed methods, specifically focussed on reduction of stigma, increase in mental health awareness and other process indicators.Conclusions. This project addresses a number of objectives as outlined in the Mental Health Action Plan of World Health Organization and India's National Mental Health Programme and Policy. If successful, the next phase will involve design and conduct of a cluster randomised controlled trial.","Maulik, P.

1259,Randomized trial of a psychologic distress screening program after breast cancer: Effects on quality of life,"Purpose: Although psychosocial intervention can reduce psychosocial distress following breast cancer, many women who are experiencing problems are not identified and offered additional help. This trial assessed effects on quality of life of psychologic distress screening among newly diagnosed, nonmetastatic breast cancer patients.Patients and Methods: From 1990 to 1992, all eligible patients in one regional breast cancer center were identified and offered study participation. Women in both control and experimental groups received brief psychosocial intervention from a social worker at initial treatment. The experimental group also had monthly telephone screening of distress levels using a brief, validated instrument, with additional psychosocial intervention offered only to those with high distress at screening. Results: Among 282 eligible patients, 89% were randomized and completed the study. participants' psychosocial distress levels decreased over the study period (P = .0001). However, no between-group differences were observed. Mean distress scores among control and experimental women at 0-, 3-, and 12-month interviews were 20.7 and 20.4, 15.5 and 15.0, and 14.6 and 13.5, respectively. No between-group differences were observed with respect to physical health, functional status, social and leisure activities, return to work, or marital satisfaction. Conclusion: Our results indicate that, among patients who receive a minimal psychosocial intervention as part of their initial cancer care, ct distress screening program does not improve quality of life. Minimal psychosocial intervention at initial treatment may be effective in reducing distress, thus making it difficult to obtain additional benefit from a screening program.

1260,"Enhancing Psychosocial Support for HIV Positive Adolescents in Harare, Zimbabwe","Background: There is a recognized gap in the evidence base relating to the nature and components of interventions to address the psycho-social needs of HIV positive young people. We used mixed methods research to strengthen a community support group intervention for HIV positive young people based in Harare, Zimbabwe.Methods: A quantitative questionnaire was administered to HIV positive Africaid support group attendees. Afterwards, qualitative data were collected from young people aged 15-18 through tape-recorded in-depth interviews (n = 10), 3 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 16 life history narratives. Data were also collected from caregivers, health care workers, and community members through FGDs (n = 6 groups) and in-depth interviews (n = 12). Quantitative data were processed and analysed using STATA 10. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis.Results: 229/310 young people completed the quantitative questionnaire (74% participation). Median age was 14 (range 618 years); 59% were female. Self-reported adherence to antiretrovirals was sub-optimal. Psychological well being was poor (median score on Shona Symptom Questionnaire 9/14); 63% were at risk of depression. Qualitative findings suggested that challenges faced by positive children include verbal abuse, stigma, and discrimination. While data showed that support group attendance is helpful, young people stressed that life outside the confines of the group was more challenging. Caregivers felt ill-equipped to support the children in their care. These data, combined with a previously validated conceptual framework for family-centred interventions, were used to guide the development of the existing programme of adolescent support groups into a more comprehensive evidence-based psychosocial support programme encompassing caregiver and household members.Conclusions: This study allowed us to describe the lived experiences of HIV positive young people and their caregivers in Zimbabwe. The findings contributed to the enhancement of Africaid's existing programme of support to better promote psychological well being and ART adherence.","Mavhu, Webster; Berwick, Jessica; Chirawu, Petronella; Makamba, Memory; Copas, Andrew; Dirawo, Jeffrey; Willis, Nicola; Araya, Ricardo; Abas, Melanie A.; Corbett, Elizabeth L.; Mungofa, Stanley; Laver, Susan M.; Cowan, Frances M.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0070254,966
1261,Primary cerebral blood flow deficiency and Alzheimer's disease: Shadows and lights,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder characterized by a decreased regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). It is most likely that a reduction in CBF could displace a pathway leading to AD genesis, in so far neuron death explains a sustained reduction in the supply of oxygen, glucose, and nutrients. Nevertheless, the concept of secondary CBF deficiency cannot explain the critical stages of early memory loss while, on the other hand, the picture of progressive ischemia due to primary CBF decline sheds light on the course of AD in a most persuasive manner. The concept of primary CBF deficiency is even more strengthened by the lack of correlation between degree of dementia and amount of CBF. Vascular abnormalities, frequently observed to co-occur with AD, might play a critical role in the initiation and aggravation of AD pathology given that the elimination of amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) through a vascular route is an important brain AÎ² clearance mechanism and its failure leads to formation of vascular amyloidosis and dense-core plaques. The goal of this review is to provide scientists comprehensive knowledge of the state-of the art influence vascular damage and reduced perfusion have on the final development of AD and to hopefully stimulate more research in this area of neuroscience.

1262,Mindfulness training for coaches: A mixed-method exploratory study,"Mindfulness-based research in sport has focused on athletes, while coaches remain unexplored. Research consistently shows that coaches experience high stress, which can lead to burnout, reduced performance, and emotional mismanagement. The present study developed and explored Mindfulness Training for Coaches (MTC), which is aimed at increasing mindfulness and emotional stability while reducing anxiety. Participants were 20 Division I coaches. The mixed-method design included trait and state measures of anxiety, mindfulness, and emotion, along with qualitative semistructured interviews. Trained coaches reported significantly less anxiety and greater emotional stability from pre- to posttraining. The state measures showed trained coaches were lower in anxiety and adverse emotions at each time point. Interviews showed six distinct positive impacts on coaches: anxiety and stress; emotions; mindfulness; coaching; athletes; and personal life. MTC is a promising intervention for coaches to reduce stress, improve well-being, and enhance coach-athlete interactions.

1263,A Randomized Clinical Trial of Alternative Stress Management Interventions in Persons With HIV Infection,"Research in psychoneuroimmunology suggests that immunosuppression associated with perceived stress may contribute to disease progression in persons with HIV infection. While stress management interventions may enhance immune function, few alternative approaches have yet been tested. This randomized clinical trial was conducted to test effects of three 10-week stress management approaches-cognitive-behavioral relaxation training (RLXN), focused tai chi training (TCHI), and spiritual growth groups (SPRT)-in comparison to a wait-listed control group (CTRL) among 252 individuals with HIV infection. Using repeated measures mixed modeling, the authors found that in comparison to the CTRL group, (a) both the RLXN and TCHI groups used less emotion-focused coping, and (b) all treatment groups had augmented lymphocyte proliferative function. Despite modest effects of the interventions on psychosocial functioning, robust findings of improved immune function have important clinical implications, particularly for persons with immune-mediated illnesses.

1264,Toward Treatment Integrity: Developing an Approach to Measure the Treatment Integrity of a Dialectical Behavior Therapy Intervention With Homeless Youth in the Community,"The current paper discusses an approach to measuring treatment integrity of dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) when implemented within two programs providing services to street-involved youth in the community. Measuring treatment integrity is a critical component of effective implementation of evidence-based interventions in clinical practice, since sound treatment integrity increases confidence in client outcomes and intervention replicability. Despite being an essential part of implementation science, few studies report on treatment integrity, with limited research addressing either measurement tools or maintenance of treatment integrity. To address the lack of available treatment integrity measures, researchers in the current study developed and piloted a treatment integrity measure which pertain to the individual and group components of DBT. A total of 20 recordings were assessed using the treatment integrity measure. Results indicate that the community agency staff (e.g. youth workers, social workers & nurses) implemented the intervention as intended; increasing confidence in the outcome variables, the staffs' training and the replicability of the intervention. This article offers one approach to addressing treatment integrity when implementing evidence-based interventions, such as DBT in a community setting, and discusses the need for effective and feasible integrity measures that can be adopted in order to strengthen mental health practice in community settings.

1268,"A social ecological, relationship-based strategy for parent involvement: Families And Schools Together (FAST)","Purpose - Most schools struggle to get busy and stressed parents to come repeatedly to the school building for events. At primary schools, especially those with pupils living in low-income communities or with many immigrants, involving parents to come at all is seen as a challenge. The purpose of this paper is to present a social ecological strategy of using the school building as a site for families to gather and for community networks to grow by building relationships between parents who have same-aged children attending that school. When families know other families, they feel more comfortable coming into the school building, and probably will return frequently.Design/methodology/approach - A large randomised controlled trial of 52 urban schools with an average of 73 per cent Latino students situated in disadvantaged neighbourhoods in the USA has data to examine the impact of this strategy on parent involvement. Parents of all first-grade students (age 6 or 7) at schools assigned either to Families and Schools Together (FAST) or services-as-usual were invited to participate. At schools with the social ecological strategy universal invites were made to those in the study to attend any one of eight weekly multi-family group sessions offered after-school at the building. Trained teams were culturally representative of the families (language, ethnicity) and made up of local parents and professionals; each team hosted up to ten families in a hub for two and a half hours (83 families attended at one session). Parents were socially included, treated with respect, coached by the team to lead a family meal, singing, family crafts and games at a family table. Parent time (respite) was provided with chat-time in pairs, followed by parent-led discussion groups. Parents were coached in one to one time, ""child-led"" responsive play for 15 minutes.Findings - Parent involvement data showed that on average, 43.6 per cent of all first-graders' families (an average of 44 families per school) attended at least one session; of those, who attended at least one session, 69 per cent returned for another. On average, of those families who attended at least once, the average family went four times; an average of 22 families per school attended six or more sessions. Parent graduates led monthly booster sessions open to all families. In half of the families, both fathers and mothers attended; immigrant parents attended statistically significantly more than native-born ones. In surveys, more parents in schools with FAST vs control reported attending three or more events at school.Practical implications - The FAST programme encourages the involvement of reluctant parents in school events. This benefits both children's general well-being and academic attainment and so contributes to preventative public health strategies.Originality/value - This paper brings new perspectives to the challenges faced by educators in involving parents at school by a sociologist-led research team introducing a social worker-developed social ecological, systemic strategy to schools in low-income communities using a randomised controlled design. This novel social ecological approach has consistently and effectively engaged whole families into increased involvement in schools in 20 countries, especially in low-income communities. Headteachers consistently report increased school engagement of FAST parent graduates for years, suggesting that the early intensity builds ongoing relationships of trust and reciprocity across home, school and community. Policy makers should note that building social capital in disadvantaged communities through partnerships with parents and schools can result in decreased disparities in health, social care and education.","McDonald, Lynn; Miller, Hannah; Sandler, Jen",0,10.1108/JCS-07-2015-0025,971

1271,"Feasibility, Acceptability, and Preliminary Effectiveness of a 4-Week Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Protocol for Hospital Employees","Hospital employees may experience occupational stress and burnout, which negatively impact quality of life and job performance. Evidence-based interventions implemented within the hospital setting are needed to promote employeesâ€™ well-being. We offered a 4-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) group program for hospital employees and used a mixed-methods practice-based research approach to explore feasibility, acceptability, and effects on stress and burnout. Participants were 65 hospital employees (MageÂ =Â 44.06; 85% white) who participated between September 2015 and January 2016. Participants completed validated measures of stress and burnout before and after the program and answered open-ended satisfaction questions after the program. Groups consistently enrolled at least ten participants, but attendance rates declined across sessions (76% at session 2 vs. 54% at session 4) due primarily to work-related scheduling conflicts. The program content was acceptable as evidenced by high perceived value (MÂ =Â 9.18 out of 10), homework compliance (51% practicing at least three times/week), and qualitative requests for program expansion. There were large, statistically significant decreases in stress (Î”MÂ =Â 2.1, pÂ <Â .001, dÂ =Â 0.85) and medium decreases in burnout (Î”MÂ =Â 0.46, pÂ =Â .01, dÂ =Â 0.57), which were supported by qualitative themes of improved self-regulation and mindfulness skills, stress reduction, emotional well-being, and improved work productivity and patient care skills. Findings suggest that 4-week MBCT is acceptable and useful for hospital employees, though research is needed to identify alternate delivery methods or strategies to enhance session attendance.

1273,Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management for Healthy Women at Risk for Breast Cancer: a Novel Application of a Proven Intervention,"Background: Women at risk for breast cancer report elevated psychological distress, which has been adversely associated with cancer-relevant behaviors and biology. Purpose: The present study sought to examine the effects of a 10-week cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) group intervention on distress among women with a family history of breast cancer. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to CBSM (N = 82) or a wait-list comparison group (N = 76). Baseline to postintervention effects of CBSM on depressive symptoms and perceived stress were examined using hierarchical regression. Results: CBSM participants reported significantly lower posttreatment depressive symptoms (Î² = âˆ’0.17, p < 0.05) and perceived stress (Î² = âˆ’0.23, p < 0.05) than wait-list comparison participants. Additionally, greater relaxation practice predicted lower distress. Conclusions: Group-based CBSM intervention is feasible and can reduce psychological distress among women with a family history of breast cancer. The present findings represent an encouraging avenue for the future application of CBSM.

1274,"A review of the relation between dissociation, memory, executive functioning and social cognition in military members and civilians with neuropsychiatric conditions","Dissociative experiences, involving altered states of consciousness, have long been understood as a consequence or response to traumatic experiences, where a reduced level of consciousness may aid in survival during and after a traumatic event. Indeed, the dissociative subtype of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD-DS) was added recently to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5). Dissociative symptoms are present across a host of neuropsychiatric conditions, including PTSD, psychotic spectrum illnesses, anxiety and mood disorders. Transdiagnostically, the presence of dissociative symptoms is associated with a greater illness burden and reduced treatment outcomes. Critically, dissociative symptoms are related to impaired performance on measures of attention, executive functioning, memory, and social cognition and may contribute to the widespread cognitive dysfunction observed across psychiatric illnesses. Despite this knowledge, the relation between dissociative symptoms and reduced cognitive function remains poorly understood. Here, we review the evidence linking dissociative symptoms to cognitive dysfunction across neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, we explore two potential neurobiological mechanisms that may underlie the relation between dissociative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in trauma-related neuropsychiatric conditions. Specifically, we hypothesize that: 1) functional sensory deafferentation at the level of the thalamus, as observed in the defence cascade model of dissociation, may underlie reduced attention and arousal leading to progressive cognitive dysfunction and; 2) altered functional connectivity between key brain networks implicated in cognitive functioning may represent a critical neurobiological mechanism linking dissociative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in patients with PTSD-DS and transdiagnostically.

1275,Body temperature in sedentary adults during moderate exercise: No effect from exercise the day before,"Background: Epidemiological findings show a continued presence of exertional heat injury during military basic recruit training. Current guidelines do not consider the carry-over effects of prior exercise or exposure to high ambient temperatures on the risk of succumbing to heat illness. Hypothesis: From the epidemiological evidence we hypothesized that both prior exercise and exposure to hot environments on the day before would increase the core temperature response during exercise the next day. Methods: Seven sedentary and non heat-acclimated men and women each performed eight randomized exposures involving treadmill walking for a maximum of 2 h every 2 wk. Two separate control trials at a wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) of 22.5degreesC and 26.5degreesC consisted of exercise during the morning only. Six experimental trials involved successive days of exercise with trials on the second day at either a WBGT of 22.5degreesC or 26.5degreesC. All of the experimental trials involved walking during the first morning at a WBGT of 22.5degreesC. Further, four of these trials included additional exercise in the afternoon at either a WBGT of 22.5degreesC (two trials) or 29.5degreesC (two trials). Results: There was no impact of prior exercise on the day preceding the tests at either WBGT for any of the dependent measures. Rectal temperatures increased to 38.0degreesC at the WBGT of 22.5degreesC and to 38.5degreesC for trials at 26.5degreesC. There were also no carry-over effects from exercise conducted during the preceding afternoon. Conclusions: Under situations where individuals are well hydrated, rested, and free-of injury, illness, and drug use, repeated exercise bouts on successive days do not alter the thermoregulatory response to exercise.","McLellan, TM; Rhind, SG; Bell, DG",0,,976
1276,Positive psychology and well-being at sea,"In light of research indicating that mariners as a professional group are amongst those at the highest risk for stress and associated mental health conditions, researchers are calling for the psychological health of seafarers to be effectively investigated, measured, and addressed. It has been suggested that the shipping industry could benefit by availing of modern scientific psychology interventions. The application of positive psychology interventions and training to the maritime context has great potential in this regard. This chapter explores positive psychology as an approach to enhancing well-being at sea. The isolated, confined, and safety-critical environment of the ship exposes seafarers to a very particular assortment of stressors. However, this environment also offers unique opportunities to develop and apply positive psychology programmes in the maritime context. We highlight some of the interventions that have been used in other contexts and consider their application to the maritime sector. Robust research is required that shows the effects of such interventions on seafarersâ€™ psychological well-being. Recommendations are made for future research relating to the use of online or computer-based positive psychology interventions and training, and research on maritime health at the systems level.

1277,What's bugging your teen?â€”The microbiota and adolescent mental health,"Human adolescence is a time of enormous developmental change, second only to infancy and early childhood in terms of brain shaping and growth. It is also a period in life when the young adult is faced with distinct environmental challenges and stressors. Interestingly, we now know that these external sources of stress all have an impact on the intestinal microbiota. Given that there is now a significant body of knowledge indicating a role for the microbiota-gut-brain axis in development and function of the brain, and potentially the emergence of psychiatric illnesses, we need to draw our attention to the intestinal microbiota in the adolescent. As psychiatric illnesses frequently first manifest during the teenage years it may be that the intestinal bacteria are playing an as yet unidentified role in disease pathogenesis. Identifying a role for the microbiota in psychiatric illnesses opens up an exciting opportunity for therapeutic advances via bacterial manipulation. This could prove to be a beneficial and novel avenue for treatment of mental illnesses in the developing teen.

This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the prevalence of high levels of distress among oncologists. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol is registered at the PROSPERO international prospective register (ref. 2015:CRD42015016325). We categorised data items according to the following distress factors: burnout, psychiatric morbidity, stress, depression, disrupted sleep, stress-induced physical symptoms, and substance use. We meta-analysed the prevalence of burnout and psychiatric morbidity using random effects models with MetaXL software. Results: The meta-analyses showed that 32% of 4876 oncologists had high burnout (Â±CI 28%-36%) and 27% of 2384 had high psychiatric morbidity (Â±CI 23%-32%). Studies also showed that 42% to 69% feel stressed at work, >12% of oncologists screen positive for depression, many oncologists suffer from sleep deprivation, up to 30% drink alcohol in a problematic way, and up to 20% of junior oncologists use hypnotic drugs, and some frequently experience stress-induced complaints such as ulcers, gastric problems, headaches, and arrhythmia. Conclusions: Occupational distress reduces career satisfaction, affects patient care, and increases the chances of oncologists switching to another area of medicine; therefore, future research should explore appropriate interventions.

1280,"Improving well-being at work: A randomized controlled intervention based on selection, optimization, and compensation","This study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate an occupational health intervention that is based on the theoretical model of selection, optimization, and compensation (SOC). We conducted a stratified randomized controlled intervention with 70 nurses of a community hospital in Germany (94% women; mean age 43.7 years). Altogether, the training consisted of 6 sessions (16.5 hours) over a period of 9 months. The training took place in groups of 6-8 employees. Participants were familiarized with the SOC model and developed and implemented a personal project based on SOC to cope effectively with 1 important job demand or to activate a job resource. Consistent with our hypotheses, we observed a meaningful trend that the proposed SOC training enhanced mental well-being, particularly in employees with a strong commitment to the intervention. While highly committed training participants reported higher levels of job control at follow-up, the effects were not statistical significant. Additional analyses of moderation effects showed that the training is particularly effective to enhance mental well-being when job control is low. Contrary to our assumptions, perceived work ability was not improved by the training. Our study provides first indications that SOC training might be a promising approach to occupational health and stress prevention. Moreover, it identifies critical success factors of occupational interventions based on SOC. However, additional studies are needed to corroborate the effectiveness of SOC trainings in the occupational contexts.

1282,Infant health effects of a nurse-community health worker home visitation programme: A randomized controlled trial,"Background Home visiting is supported as a way to improve child health and development. Home visiting has been usually provided by nurses or community health workers (CHWs). Few studies compared the child health advantages of a nurse-CHW team approach over nurse prenatal and postnatal home visiting. Methods A randomized trial was conducted with Medicaid-insured pregnant women in Kent County, Michigan. Pregnant women were assigned to a team intervention including nurse-CHW home visitation, or standard community care (CC) including nurse home visitation. Morbidity was assessed in 530 infants over their first 12 months of life from medical claims and reported by the mother. Results There were no differences in overall child health between the nurse-CHW intervention and the CC arm over the first year of life. There were fewer mother-reported asthma/wheezing/croup diagnostics in the team intervention group among infants whose mothers have low psychosocial resources (13% vs. 27%, P=0.01; adjusted OR=0.4, P=0.01). There were no differences in diagnosed asthma/wheezing/croup documented by medical claims. There were no differences in immunizations, hospitalizations and ear infections. Conclusions There was no strong evidence that infant health was improved by the addition of CHWs to a programme of CC that included nurse home visitation. Targeting such interventions at common health problems of infancy and childhood or at diagnosed chronic conditions may prove more successful.

1283,Effects of screening for psychological distress on patient outcomes in cancer: A systematic review,"Objective: Several practice guidelines recommend routine screening for psychological distress in cancer care. The objective was to evaluate the effect of screening cancer patients for psychological distress by assessing the (1) effectiveness of interventions to reduce distress among patients identified as distressed; and (2) effects of screening for distress on distress outcomes. Methods: CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, ISI, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and SCOPUS databases were searched through April 6, 2011 with manual searches of 45 relevant journals, reference list review, citation tracking of included articles, and trial registry reviews through June 30, 2012. Articles in any language on cancer patients were included if they (1) compared treatment for patients with psychological distress to placebo or usual care in a randomized controlled trial (RCT); or (2) assessed the effect of screening on psychological distress in a RCT. Results: There were 14 eligible RCTs for treatment of distress, and 1 RCT on the effects of screening on patient distress. Pharmacological, psychotherapy and collaborative care interventions generally reduced distress with small to moderate effects. One study investigated effects of screening for distress on psychological outcomes, and it found no improvement. Conclusion: Treatment studies reported modest improvement in distress symptoms, but only a single eligible study was found on the effects of screening cancer patients for distress, and distress did not improve in screened patients versus those receiving usual care. Because of the lack of evidence of beneficial effects of screening cancer patients for distress, it is premature to recommend or mandate implementation of routine screening.

1285,A pilot study evaluation of psychosocial competency training for junior physicians working in oncology and hematology,"Background: This pilot and feasibility study evaluated a work-related self-care competency training in oncology and hematology medicine for junior physicians working in oncology and hematology medicine. Methods: A pilot study was conducted with 80 physicians working in oncology and hematology hospital departments in Germany. Physicians were distributed to either the intervention group receiving competency training or a comparison group. The intervention took place in groups over a period of 12Â weeks. Training content included work-related self-care strategies, problem-solving techniques solution-focused counselling. The outcomes studied were changes in work-related stress, emotional exhaustion, emotion regulation, and job satisfaction. Follow-up assessments were arranged after 12Â weeks (T1), after 24Â weeks (T2), and after 36Â weeks (T3). Results: Intervention group reached a decrease in perceived job stress and emotional exhaustion. Self-perceived improvements were also obvious regarding enhanced emotion regulation skills. Future oncologists valued the intervention with high scores for training design, content, received outcome, and overall training satisfaction. Conclusions: This study provided first indications that an innovative self-care competency training might be a supportive approach for junior physicians starting work in oncology and hematology. However, replication studies are needed to verify the results in the medical working context.

1286,Parenting stress in mothers after very preterm birth and the effect of the Infant Behavioural Assessment and Intervention Program,"Objective Purpose of this study was to examine maternal parenting stress as a secondary outcome of the Infant Behavioural Assessment and Intervention Program (IBAIP). Methods: In a randomized controlled trial 86 very preterm infants and their parents were assigned to the intervention group and 90 to the control group. Maternal parenting stress was assessed with the Dutch version of the Parenting Stress Index at 12 and 24 months post term. Results: Mothers in the intervention group mothers assessed their infants as happier and less hyperactive/distractible compared with the control group mothers. However, mothers in the intervention group reported more feelings of social isolation. Conclusions: The IBAIP appears to have made mothers more satisfied about their infants' mood and distractibility, but also may have evoked more feelings of social isolation. Next to long-term evaluation of the development in very preterm born children, follow-up on functioning of their parents is important.

1290,After critical care: Challenges in the transition to inpatient rehabilitation,"Purpose/Objective: The aftermath of treatment for critical illness and/or critical injury in the intensive care unit (ICU) often includes persisting cognitive and emotional morbidities as well as severe physical deconditioning (a constellation termed post-intensive care syndrome, or PICS), but most patients do not receive psychological services before they enter the inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF). Although a burgeoning literature guides the efforts of critical care providers to reduce risk factors for PICS - for example, reducing the use of sedatives and enacting early mobilization, there is need for a corresponding awareness among IRF psychologists and other providers that the post-ICU patient often arrives in a state of significantly reduced capacity, with persisting cognitive impairments and acute psychological distress. Many are at risk for long-term complications of posttraumatic stress disorder, general anxiety and/or clinical depression, and assuredly all have experienced a profound life disruption. This paper offers a multilevel perspective on the adaptation of post-ICU patients during inpatient rehabilitation, with discussion of the psychologist's role in education and intervention. Research Method/Design: Clinical review paper. Results: NA. Conclusions: To optimize response to rehabilitation, it is important to understand the behavior of post-ICU patients within a full biopsychosocial context including debility, cognitive and emotional impairment, disruption of role identities, and environmental factors. The psychologist can provide education about predictable barriers to participation for the post-ICU patient, and guide individual, family and team interventions to ameliorate those barriers.

Currently, many CVD patients continue to show cardiac events despite optimal treatment of traditional risk factors. This evidence suggests that additional interventions, particularly those aimed at nontraditional factors, might be useful for continuing the decline. Psychosocial stress is a newly recognized (nontraditional) risk factor that appears to contribute to all recognized mechanisms underlying cardiac events, specifically, (a) clustering of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, (b) endothelial dysfunction, (c) myocardial ischemia, (d) plaque rupture, (e) thrombosis, and (f) malignant arrhythmias. A better understanding of the behavioral and physiologic associations between psychosocial stress and CVD will assist researchers in identifying effective approaches for reducing or reversing the damaging effects of stress and may lead to further reductions of CVD morbidity and mortality.","Merz C.N.B., Dwyer J., Nordstrom C.K., Walton K.G., Salerno J.W., Schneider R.H.",0,10.1080/08964280209596039,986
1293,Factors Associated With Participation in Work-Site Wellness Programs: Implications for Increasing Willingness Among Rural Service Employees,"The purpose of this study was to identify factors underlying decisions to participate in work-site wellness programs. A sample of 279 full-time workers from a service division of a rural Midwestern university completed a survey assessing demographic and job characteristics, health status and health behaviors, and Reasoned Action Approach (RAA) variables for participating in work-site wellness activities. Regression analyses identified factors associated with intention; multivariate analyses of variance compared low to high intenders on salient beliefs. In sequential regression analyses, constructs of RAA predicted intention over and above the three significant background variables of age, exercise in past month, and fruit and vegetable consumption (R-2 = .469, R-2 change = .409, p < .001). Attitude had the highest relative weight (beta = .445, p < .001); perceived norm had a significant weight (beta = .273, p < .001). Significant differences in beliefs were found. To increase participation, planners should design programs that provide benefits employees perceive as advantageous and ensure coworker and supervisor support.","Middlestadt, SE; Sheats, JL; Geshnizjani, A; Sullivan, MR; Arvin, CS",0,10.1177/1090198110384469,987
1294,Targets for the prevention of dementia,"The prevalence of dementia is expected to increase dramatically over the upcoming decades due to the aging population. Since treatment is still short of a cure, preventative strategies are of the utmost importance. Stimulating activity (cognitive, physical, and social), vascular risk factors, and diet may be important in preventative strategies. Dementia risk may be modified by participation in stimulating activities. One study suggested that the cognitive, physical, and social components of activity were of equal importance to cognitive outcomes. However, while exercise interventions appear to benefit global cognition, the benefits from cognitive training appear to be domain specific. People with vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity) appear to be at higher risk for dementia than those without in observational and clinical trials. Controlled trials suggest that vascular risk management via some pharmaceutical interventions may benefit cognition, though results are inconsistent. Finally, people who adhere to a Mediterranean diet or who have high intake of antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids have reduced likelihood of dementia in observational studies. However, supplementation in controlled trials has not generally proved successful at improving cognitive outcomes. A single supplement may be insufficient to prevent dementia; it may be that the overall diet is more important. Future large randomized controlled studies should examine whether interventions can reduce the risk of dementia and whether combining cognitive, physical, and social activity, vascular risk reduction, and dietary interventions might have additive or multiplicative effects.

BACKGROUND: Job-related stress in nurses leads to high rates of burnout, compromises patient care, and costs US healthcare organizations billions of dollars annually. Many mindfulness and resiliency programs are taught in a format that limits nurses' attendance. METHODS: Consistent with blended learning, participants chose the format that met their learning styles and goals; Web-based, independent reading, facilitated discussions. The end points of mindfulness, resilience, anxiety, stress, happiness, and burnout were measured at baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up to examine within-group differences. RESULTS: Findings showed statistically significant, clinically meaningful decreases in anxiety, stress, and burnout and increases in resilience, happiness, and mindfulness. CONCLUSIONS: Results support blended learning using SMART as a strategy to increase access to resiliency training for nursing staff.","Magtibay, DL; Chesak, SS; Coughlin, K; Sood, A",1,10.1097/NNA.0000000000000501,989
1297,Learning to cope with anxiety: Long-term links from adolescence to adult career satisfaction,"This study examined the long-term effect of anxiety on career satisfaction for young adults in the United States. The abilities to positively cope with stress and function competently as an adult were examined as potential moderators of this link, and adolescent developmental precursors of these abilities were also investigated. Analyses revealed a negative association between anxiety at age 21 and career satisfaction at age 27. However, this association was ameliorated for youth with better coping skills and functional competence at age 24. Autonomy and relatedness behaviors with best friends and mothers were examined as potential predictors of these moderators, with positive autonomy and relatedness from friends at age 13 emerging as the sole predictor of these skills. Results suggest that although anxiety may inhibit career satisfaction for many youth, positive coping and adult functional competence skills may allow anxious individuals to achieve career satisfaction. Moreover, these skills may be promoted through peer relationships in early adolescence. Â© 2018","Miles M.M., Szwedo D.E., Allen J.P.",0,10.1016/j.adolescence.2018.01.003,990
1298,The Positive Outlook Study: A Randomised Controlled Trial Evaluating Online Self-Management for HIV Positive Gay Men,"The aim of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness of an online self-management program in improving health outcomes and well-being for gay men living with HIV in Australia. The online Positive Outlook Program was based on self-efficacy theory and used a self-management approach to enhance HIV-positive gay menâ€™s skills, confidence and abilities to manage the psychosocial issues associated with HIV in daily life. The 7-week program was delivered in closed groups and comprised information modules, action-planning activities, moderated discussion boards, and weekly peer-facilitated â€˜live chatsâ€™. A randomised controlled trial was conducted to establish the effectiveness of the Positive Outlook program compared to a â€˜usual careâ€™ control. Participants were HIV-positive gay men 18Â years or older living in Australia. Primary outcomes were evaluated at three time-points (baseline, post-intervention and 12-weekâ€™s post-intervention follow-up) and included HIV-related quality of life (PROQOL-HIV), outcomes of health education (HeiQ) and HIV specific self-efficacy (Positive Outlook Self-Efficacy Scale). A total of 132 gay men with HIV in Australia were randomly allocated to the intervention (nÂ =Â 68) or usual care control (nÂ =Â 64) groups. Maximum likelihood marginal-linear modelling indicated significant improvement in the intervention group on the PROQOL-HIV subscales of body change (pÂ =Â 0.036), social relationships (pÂ =Â 0.035) and emotional distress (pÂ =Â 0.031); the HeiQ subscales of health-directed activity (pÂ =Â 0.048); constructive attitudes and approaches (pÂ =Â 0.015); skill and technique acquisition (pÂ =Â 0.046) and health service navigation (pÂ =Â 0.008); and the Positive Outlook Self-Efficacy Scale on the subscales of relationships (pÂ =Â 0.019); social participation (pÂ =Â 0.006); and emotions (pÂ =Â 0.041).

1299,Physical Activity Intervention Effects on Perceived Stress in Working Mothers: The Role of Self-Efficacy,"Working mothers often report elevated stress, and efforts to improve their coping resources are needed to buffer the detrimental effects of stress on health. This study examined the impact of changes in physical activity, self-efficacy, and self-regulation across the course of a brief intervention on subsequent levels of stress in working mothers. Participants (N = 141) were randomly assigned to an intervention or control condition (2:1 ratio). The intervention was conducted in Illinois between March 2011 and January 2012 and consisted of two group-mediated workshop sessions with content based on social cognitive theory. Participants completed measures of physical activity, self-efficacy, self-regulation, and perceived stress at baseline, immediately postintervention, and 6-month follow-up. Stress levels declined across the 6-month period in both groups. Changes in stress were negatively associated with changes in self-efficacy and self-regulation among intervention participants only. Regression analyses revealed the intervention elicited short-term increases in physical activity, self-efficacy, and self-regulation, but only changes in self-efficacy predicted perceived stress at 6-month follow-up. These results suggest that enhancing self-efficacy is likely to improve working mothers' perceived capabilities to cope with stressors in their lives. Future interventions should continue to focus on increasing self-efficacy to promote improvements in physical activity and psychological well-being in this population.","Mailey, EL; McAuley, E",1,10.1080/03630242.2014.899542,992

1301,Pelvic stress injuries in the athlete - Management and prevention,"Stress-related injuries of the pelvis are an important consideration in sports medicine. Diagnosis of stress injuries may be difficult and requires a high index of suspicion. Plain radiographs are the first step in imaging but magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging modality of choice for definitive diagnosis. Repetitive forces transferred to the bone, either through muscle fatigue or from the tensile forces generated by the contracting muscles, are thought to be the causative mechanism of stress injuries. Interestingly, the reparative and reorganisational process of bone result in a temporary weakening before ultimately producing a reinforced structure better adept at supporting repetitive stress. This temporary weakness occurs for several weeks after the initiation of a training programme. Knowledge of the mechanism and aetiology of stress injuries provides the foundation for treatment and prevention. Resting the involved bone through modifying the training programme is the mainstay of treatment. Every effort to prevent stress injuries should be made when initiating a training programme. A cyclical training programme, one that does not place continued and undue stress on any one bone, but provides adequate rest for bone recovery, is recommended. Attention to proper nutrition is emphasised for both treatment and prevention. Maintenance of a normal hormonal balance is additionally important in the female athlete. The bone-maintaining properties of estrogen from a normal eumenorrhoeic menstrual cycle should be preserved. Rarely, women may develop an inter-related problem of disordered eating, amenorrhoea and osteoporosis, the female athlete triad. The female athlete triad is a serious problem that may result in a permanent loss of bone mass. This article more fully explains the mechanism of stress injuries to bone, and provides a more detailed discussion of diagnosis, treatment and prevention.","Miller, C; Major, N; Toth, A",0,10.2165/00007256-200333130-00005,994
1302,Workplace based mindfulness practice and inflammation: A randomized trial,"We have developed a low dose Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI-Id) that reduces the time committed to meetings and formal mindfulness practice, while conducting the sessions during the workday. This reduced the barriers commonly mentioned for non-participation in mindfulness programs. In a controlled randomized trial we studied university faculty and staff (n = 186) who were found to have an elevated CRP level,>3.0 mg/ml, and who either had, or were at risk for cardiovascular disease. This study was designed to evaluate if MBI-Id could produce a greater decrease in CRP. IL-6 and cortisol than an active control group receiving a lifestyle education program when measured at the end of the 2 month interventions. We found that MBI-Id significantly enhanced mindfulness by 2-months and it was maintained for up to a year when compared to the education control. No significant changes were noted between interventions in cortisol, IL-6 levels or self-reported measures of perceived stress, depression and sleep quality at 2-months. Although not statistically significant (p=.08), the CRP level at 2-months was one mg/ml lower in the MBI-Id group than in the education control group, a change which may have clinical significance (Ridker et al., 2000; Wassel et al., 2010). A larger MBI-Id effect on CRP (as compared to control) occurred among participants who had a baseline BMI <30 (-2.67 mg/ml) than for those with BMI >30 (-0.18 mg/ml). We conclude that MBI-Id should be more fully investigated as a low-cost self-directed complementary strategy for decreasing inflammation, and it seems most promising for non-obese subjects.

1303,The long-term impact of post traumatic stress disorder on recovery from heroin dependence,"The high prevalence of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among people with heroin dependence and its impact on short term outcomes has been well established. The impact of PTSD on long-term recovery is, however, unknown. This paper examines the impact of current and lifetime PTSD on long-term recovery from heroin dependence among participants who took part in the 11-year follow-up of the Australian Treatment Outcome Study (ATOS), a prospective naturalistic longitudinal study of 615 people with heroin dependence recruited from Sydney, Australia, in 2001â€“2002. Seventy-one percent of the cohort (n = 431) were re-interviewed 11-years post study entry. Outcomes examined included heroin and other drug use, dependence, general physical and mental health, depression, PTSD, employment, and the incidence of trauma exposure, overdose, imprisonment, and attempted suicide over the 11- year follow-up. Despite having a poorer profile at baseline, individuals with current PTSD or a history of PTSD at baseline demonstrated similar levels of improvement to those without a history of PTSD in all outcome domains across the 11-year follow-up, PTSD was associated with consistently higher levels of major depression, and attempted suicide, subsequent trauma exposure, and poorer occupational functioning across the 11-year follow-up. These findings highlight the importance of interventions aimed at occupational rehabilitation, reducing the likelihood of retraumatisation, and addressing PTSD and associated comorbidities among people with heroin dependence.

The study concerns a stress management training program developed for female production workers with little formal education, based on the cognitive approach of Rational-Emotive-Behavioral Training (REBT). Several strategies and teaching aids suitable for such a population are suggested. Twenty-seven women participated in the program. Fourteen of them comprised the waiting-list control group, Burnout, tension, listlessness, cognitive weariness, and work/home conflict were assessed before, at the end, and at 12 months follow-up. At the end of the six-session program, four of the five measures in the experimental group were significantly reduced compared to the control group. At the 12 months follow-up, tension and burnout were still reduced compared to baseline suggesting that REBT can be successfully taught to such participants but booster sessions are required.","Malkinson, R; Kushnir, T; Weisberg, E",1,,997
1306,A stress management programme for inflammatory bowel disease patients,"This randomized controlled trial was designed to determine whether practising stress management techniques would decrease disease activity and promote psychosocial functioning in inflammatory bowel disease patients. Eighty ambulatory adults received a preâ€intervention interview, at which time baseline data about disease activity and psychosocial functioning were collected. They were then randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group received six classes on stress management which included autogenics, personal planning skills and communication techniques. All 80 subjects were followed up at 4â€month intervals for 1 year by interviewers who were blind to group designation. The data collection instruments, which were used at all assessment points, comprised three questionnaires: the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Stress Index. These instruments produced scores which decreased with improvement in physical and psychosocial wellâ€being. At all assessment points, both the CDAI and IBD Stress Index scores dropped significantly (P<005) from baseline in the treatment group. However, there was no significant change in the scores ofthe control group throughout the study year. There were no significant changes in medications at any assessment point in either group that could account for changes in the scores. The results of this study indicate that stress management techniques may have therapeutic benefits for IBD patients. Copyright Â© 1986, Wiley Blackwell.

1307,Can general practitioners identify people with distress and mild depression? A meta-analysis of clinical accuracy,"Background: There is increasing emphasis on distress and mild depression but uncertainty regarding how well general practitioners (GPs) identify these conditions. Further, the proportion of attendees suffering distress is also unclear. Aim: To quantify the rate of distress in primary care and to clarify the ability of GPs to identify distressed and/or mildly depressed individuals using their clinical skills. Methods: Meta-analysis of clinical recognition of distress and mild depression defined on a continuum (severity scale) or categorically (semi-structured interview). Results: From 157 studies that examined the ability of GPs to diagnose any emotional or mental disorder, we identified 23 that focused on defined distress and 9 that reported on mild depression. The prevalence of broadly defined distress was 37.4% (n = 23, 95% CI = 29.5% to 45.5) although it was 47.3% (n = 14, 95% CI = 38.0% to 56.7%) using self-report methods. GPs correctly identified distressed individuals in 48.4% (n = 21, 95% CI = 42.6% to 54.2%) of presentations and identified non-distressed people in 79.4% (n = 21, 95% CI = 74.3% to 84.1%) of presentations without distress. GPs correctly identified 33.8% (95% CI = 27.3% to 40.7%) of people with mild depression and had a detection specificity of 80.6% (95% CI = 66.4% to 91.6%) for the non-depressed. Clinicians' ability to recognize mild depression was significantly lower than their ability to recognize moderate-severe depression. Out of 100 consecutive presentations, a typical GP making a single assessment would correctly identify 19 out of 39 people with distress, missing 20. He or she would correctly re-assure 48 out of 61 people without distress, falsely label 13 people as distressed. For mild depression, out of 100 consecutive presentations, a typical GP would correctly identify 4 out of 11 people with mild depression, missing 7. GPs would correctly re-assure 72 out of 89 people without distress, falsely diagnosing 19. Conclusions: Clinicians have considerable difficulty accurately identifying distress and mild depression in primary care with only one in three people correctly diagnosed. Clinicians are better able to identify distress than mild depression but success remains limited. However not all such individuals want professional help, and some people who are overlooked get help elsewhere, or improve spontaneously, therefore the implications of these detection problems are not yet clear.

1310,Environmental factors as modulators of neurodegeneration: Insights from gene-environment interactions in Huntington's disease,"Unlike many other neurodegenerative diseases with established gene-environment interactions, Huntington's disease (HD) is viewed as a disorder governed by genetics. The cause of the disease is a highly penetrant tandem repeat expansion encoding an extended polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. In the year 2000, a pioneering study showed that the disease could be delayed in transgenic mice by enriched housing conditions. This review describes subsequent human and preclinical studies identifying environmental modulation of motor, cognitive, affective and other symptoms found in HD. Alongside the behavioral observations we also discuss potential mechanisms and the relevance to other neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. In mouse models of HD, increased sensorimotor and cognitive stimulation can delay or ameliorate various endophenotypes. Potential mechanisms include increased trophic support, synaptic plasticity, adult neurogenesis, and other forms of experience-dependent cellular plasticity. Subsequent clinical investigations support a role for lifetime activity levels in modulating the onset and progression of HD. Stress can accelerate memory and olfactory deficits and exacerbate cellular dysfunctions in HD mice. In the absence of effective treatments to slow the course of HD, environmental interventions offer feasible approaches to delay the disease, however further preclinical and human studies are needed in order to generate clinical recommendations. Environmental interventions could be combined with future pharmacological therapies and stimulate the identification of enviromimetics, drugs which mimic or enhance the beneficial effects of cognitive stimulation and physical activity.

1311,"A Tele-Behavioral Health Intervention to Reduce Depression, Anxiety, and Stress and Improve Diabetes Self-Management","Background: Depression is prevalent among individuals with diabetes and associated with suboptimal self-management. Little is known about the feasibility and potential impact of tele-behavioral therapy to improve depressive symptoms and self-management among diabetes patients. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of consecutive graduates enrolled in a national 8-week diabetes behavioral telehealth program between August 1, 2014, and January 31, 2015 (N = 466; mean age 56.8 Â± 5.0 years; 56% female). Participant characteristics (demographics, comorbidities) were obtained by standardized questionnaire. Depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (DASS; validated Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 survey), and glucose self-testing frequency and values (point-of-care monitor) were measured at program start and completion. Changes in DASS severity and glucose self-testing frequency were assessed by chi-square tests. Changes in DASS and blood glucose levels were evaluated by paired t-tests. Results: At baseline, approximately one in three participants had elevated depression (32%), anxiety (33%), or stress (31%) scores. Significant reductions in average DASS, depression (-8.8), anxiety (-6.9), and stress (-9.9), scores were observed at graduation among those with elevated baseline scores (p < 0.0001); most (â‰¥80%) improved to less severe depression, anxiety, or stress categories. Improved glucose self-testing frequency (69% vs. 60% tested â‰¥once per week; p = 0.0005) and significant reductions in mean morning glucose levels (-12.3 mg/dL; p = 0.0002) were observed from baseline to graduation. Participants with normal versus non-normal depression scores were more likely to have lower (<mean) glucose levels at graduation (odds ratio = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.1-3.7). Conclusions: This study documented significant decreases in depression, anxiety, stress, and glucose levels, as well as increased frequency of glucose self-testing, among participants in a diabetes behavioral telehealth program.

1313,Childhood exposure to violence and lifelong health: Clinical intervention science and stress-biology research join forces,"Many young people who are mistreated by an adult, victimized by bullies, criminally assaulted, or who witness domestic violence react to this violence exposure by developing behavioral, emotional, or learning problems. What is less well known is that adverse experiences like violence exposure can lead to hidden physical alterations inside a child's body, alterations that may have adverse effects on life-long health. We discuss why this is important for the field of developmental psychopathology and for society, and we recommend that stress-biology research and intervention science join forces to tackle the problem. We examine the evidence base in relation to stress-sensitive measures for the body (inflammatory reactions, telomere erosion, epigenetic methylation, and gene expression) and brain (mental disorders, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological testing). We also review promising interventions for families, couples, and children that have been designed to reduce the effects of childhood violence exposure. We invite intervention scientists and stress-biology researchers to collaborate in adding stress-biology measures to randomized clinical trials of interventions intended to reduce effects of violence exposure and other traumas on young people.

1314,Cadmium-induced toxicity is rescued by curcumin: A review,"Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most common environmental and occupational heavy metals with extended distribution. Exposure to Cd may be associated with several deleterious consequences on the liver, bones, kidneys, lungs, testes, brain, immunological, and cardiovascular systems. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the main mechanism behind its toxicity causes oxidative stress and subsequent damages to lipids, proteins, and DNA. Therefore, antioxidants along with chelating agents have shown promising outcomes against Cd-induced toxicity. Curcumin with various beneficial effects and medical efficacy has been evaluated for its inhibitory activities against biological impairments caused by Cd. Thus, this article is intended to address the effectiveness of curcumin against toxicity following Cd entry. Curcumin can afford to attenuate lipid peroxidation, glutathione depletion, alterations in antioxidant enzyme, and so forth through scavenging and chelating activities or Nrf2/Keap1/ARE pathway induction.

1315,A randomized trial of stress management for the prevention of new brain lesions in MS,"Objectives: This trial examined the efficacy of a stress management program in reducing neuroimaging markers of multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity. Methods: A total of 121 patients with relapsing forms of MS were randomized to receive stress management therapy for MS (SMT-MS) or a wait-list control condition. SMT-MS provided 16 individual treatment sessions over 24 weeks, followed by a 24-week post-treatment follow-up. The primary outcome was the cumulative number of new gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) brain lesions on MRI at weeks 8, 16, and 24. Secondary outcomes included new or enlarging T2 MRI lesions, brain volume change, clinical exacerbation, and stress. Results: SMT-MS resulted in a reduction in cumulative Gd+ lesions (p = 0.04) and greater numbers of participants remained free of Gd+ lesions during the treatment (76.8% vs 54.7%, p = 0.02), compared to participants receiving the control treatment. SMT-MS also resulted in significantly reduced numbers of cumulative new T2 lesions (p = 0.005) and a greater number of participants remaining free of new T2 lesions (69.5% vs 42.7%, p = 0.006). These effects were no longer detectable during the 24-week post-treatment follow-up period. Conclusions: This trial indicates that SMT-MS may be useful in reducing the development of new MRI brain lesions while patients are in treatment. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence that SMT-MS, a manualized stress management therapy program, reduced the number of Gd+ lesions in patients with MS during a 24-week treatment period. This benefit was not sustained beyond 24 weeks, and there were no clinical benefits.

1316,Using the demand-control model of job strain to predict caregiver burden and caregiver satisfaction in the informal caregivers of heart failure patients,"Objectives. The demand-control (D-C) model of job strain has generated a considerable body of empirical support in predicting psychological health outcomes in the context of work. This study aimed to extend previous work using the D-C model of job strain to predict caregiver burden and satisfaction in the informal caregivers of patients with heart failure. Design and method. Data were gathered from 60 caregiver/patient dyads in a cross-sectional design. Patients with chronic stable heart failure were recruited from out-patient clinics. The dependent variables were caregiver burden and satisfaction. Demand and control were measured using both patient- and caregiver-derived measures. Results. The D-C model accounted for 15 and 19% of the variance in caregiver burden, after controlling for age, gender and relationship to the patient. Lower control was associated with higher burden. The D-C model did not predict caregiver satisfaction. Conclusion. The D-C model was associated with caregiver burden, but not satisfaction in caregivers, with control being the dominant predictor. Research linking the theory and findings from job strain and informal caregiving studies may elucidate both fields of research.

The aim of this study is to construct a comprehensive theoretical proposal for a therapeutic intervention that is sensitive to the different clinical manifestations of this state. In order to do this, the frenetic, under-challenged and worn-out subtypes of burnout are presented in a systematic manner, together with the interventions that may provide suitable management for each subtype. Said clinical profiles may represent different stages in the progression of burnout, and have specific dysfunctional mechanisms that require a choice of adjusted intervention strategies according to the characteristics of each particular case. Finally, the degree of dedication to work and its clinical repercussions are put forward as a hypothesis to explain the progressive impairment caused by burnout, and as a target on which primary, secondary and tertiary prevention strategies could be founded.","Montero-MarÃ­n J., Prado-Abril J., Demarzo M.M.P., GarcÃ­a-Toro M., GarcÃ­a-Campayo J.",0,10.5944/rppc.vol.21.num.3.2016.15686,1008
1318,"Promoting mental health in small-medium enterprises: An evaluation of the ""Business in Mind"" program","Background: Workplace mental health promotion (WMHP) aims to prevent and effectively manage the social and economic costs of common mental illnesses such as depression. The mental health of managers and employees within small-medium enterprises (SMEs) is a neglected sector in occupational health research and practice, despite the fact that this sector is the most common work setting in most economies. The availability and propensity of SME staff to attend face-to-face training/therapy or workshop style interventions often seen in corporate or public sector work settings is a widely recognised problem. The 'Business in Mind' program employs a DVD mode of delivery that is convenient for SME managers, particularly those operating in regional and remote areas where internet delivery may not be optimal. The objective of the intervention program is to improve the mental health of SME managers, and examine whether employees of managers' whose mental health improves, report positive change in their psychosocial work environment. The mechanisms via which we aim to improve managers' mental health are through the development of their psychological capital (a higher order construct comprised of hope, self efficacy, resilience and optimism) and their skills and capacities for coping with work stress.Methods/Design: The effectiveness of two versions of the program (self administered and telephone facilitated) will be assessed using a randomised trial with an active control condition (psychoeducation only). We aim to recruit a minimum of 249 managers and a sample of their employees. This design allows for 83 managers per group, as power analyses showed that this number would allow for attrition of 20% and still enable detection of an effect size of 0.5. The intervention will be implemented over a three month period and postal surveys will assess managers and employees in each group at baseline, intervention completion, and at 6 month follow up. The intervention groups (managers only) will also be assessed at 12 and 24 month follow-up to examine maintenance of effects. Primary outcomes are managers' levels of psychological capital (hope, resilience, self-efficacy and optimism), coping strategies, anxiety and depression symptoms, self-reported health, job satisfaction and job tension. Secondary outcomes are participating managers subordinates' perceptions of manager support, relational justice, emotional climate and job tension. In order to provide an economic evaluation of the intervention, both employees and manager rates of absenteeism and presenteeism will also be assessed.Discussion: The intervention being trialled is expected to improve both primary and secondary outcomes. If proven efficacious, the intervention could be disseminated to reach a much larger proportion of the business community.","Martin, Angela; Sanderson, Kristy; Scott, Jenn; Brough, Paula",1,10.1186/1471-2458-9-239,1009
1319,Communication skills training for healthcare professionals working with people who have cancer,"BackgroundThis is an updated version of a review that was originally published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in 2004, Issue 2. People with cancer, their families and carers have a high prevalence of psychological stress which may be minimised by effective communication and support from their attending healthcare professionals (HCPs). Research suggests communication skills do not reliably improve with experience, therefore, considerable effort is dedicated to courses that may improve communication skills for HCPs involved in cancer care. A variety of communication skills training (CST) courses have been proposed and are in practice. We conducted this review to determine whether CST works and which types of CST, if any, are the most effective.ObjectivesTo assess whether CST is effective in improving the communication skills of HCPs involved in cancer care, and in improving patient health status and satisfaction.Search methodsWe searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) Issue 2, 2012, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo and CINAHL to February 2012. The original search was conducted in November 2001. In addition, we handsearched the reference lists of relevant articles and relevant conference proceedings for additional studies.Selection criteriaThe original review was a narrative review that included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled before-and-after studies. In this updated version, we limited our criteria to RCTs evaluating 'CST' compared with 'no CST' or other CST in HCPs working in cancer care. Primary outcomes were changes in HCP communication skills measured in interactions with real and/or simulated patients with cancer, using objective scales. We excluded studies whose focus was communication skills in encounters related to informed consent for research.Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently assessed trials and extracted data to a pre-designed data collection form. We pooled data using the random-effects model and, for continuous data, we used standardised mean differences (SMDs).Main resultsWe included 15 RCTs (42 records), conducted mainly in outpatient settings. Eleven studies compared CST with no CST intervention, three studies compared the effect of a follow-up CST intervention after initial CST training, and one study compared two types of CST. The types of CST courses evaluated in these trials were diverse. Study participants included oncologists (six studies), residents (one study) other doctors (one study), nurses (six studies) and a mixed team of HCPs (one study). Overall, 1147 HCPs participated (536 doctors, 522 nurses and 80 mixed HCPs).Ten studies contributed data to the meta-analyses. HCPs in the CST group were statistically significantly more likely to use open questions in the post-intervention interviews than the control group (five studies, 679 participant interviews; P = 0.04, I-2 = 65%) and more likely to show empathy towards patients (six studies, 727 participant interviews; P = 0.004, I-2 = 0%); we considered this evidence to be of moderate and high quality, respectively. Doctors and nurses did not perform statistically significantly differently for any HCP outcomes. There were no statistically significant differences in the other HCP communication skills except for the subgroup of participant interviews with simulated patients, where the intervention group was significantly less likely to present 'facts only' compared with the control group (four studies, 344 participant interviews; P = 0.01, I-2 = 70%).There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to outcomes assessing HCP 'burnout', patient satisfaction or patient perception of the HCPs communication skills. Patients in the control group experienced a greater reduction in mean anxiety scores in a meta-analyses of two studies (169 participant interviews; P = 0.02; I-2 = 8%); we considered this evidence to be of a very low quality.Authors' conclusionsVarious CST courses appear to be effective in improving some types of HCP communication skills related to information gathering and supportive skills. We were unable to determine whether the effects of CST are sustained over time, whether consolidation sessions are necessary, and which types of CST programs are most likely to work. We found no evidence to support a beneficial effect of CST on HCP 'burnout', patients' mental or physical health, and patient satisfaction.","Moore, Philippa M.; Rivera Mercado, Solange; Grez Artigues, Monica; Lawrie, Theresa A.",0,10.1002/14651858.CD003751.pub3,1010
1321,Single blind randomised controlled trial of GAME (Goals - Activity - Motor Enrichment) in infants at high risk of cerebral palsy,"Background: Cerebral palsy (CP) is caused by a lesion in the developing infant brain. Recent neuroplasticity literature suggests that intensive, task-specific intervention ought to commence early, during the critical period of neural development. Aims: To determine whether ""GAME"" (Goals - Activity - Motor Enrichment), a motor learning, environmental enrichment intervention, is effective for improving motor skills in infants at high risk of CP. Methods and procedures: Single blind randomised controlled trial of GAME versus standard care. Primary outcome was motor skills on the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 (PDMS-2). Secondary outcomes included Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) and Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66). Outcome assessors were masked to group allocation and data analyzed with multiple regression. Outcomes and results: All n = 30 infants enrolled received the assigned intervention until 16 weeks post enrolment. At 12 months of age, n = 26 completed assessments. Significant between group differences were found in raw scores on the PDMS-2 in favour of GAME (B = 20.71, 95%CI 1.66-39.76, p = 0. 03) and at 12 months on the total motor quotient (B = 8.29, 95%CI 0.13-16.45,p = 0.05). Significant between group differences favored GAME participants at 12 months on the cognitive scale of the BSID-III and satisfaction scores on the COPM. Conclusion: GAME intervention resulted in advanced motor and cognitive outcomes when compared with standard care.

1322,Serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) polymorphism and susceptibility to a home-visiting maternal-infant attachment intervention delivered by community health workers in South Africa: Reanalysis of a randomized controlled trial,"BackgroundClear recognition of the damaging effects of poverty on early childhood development has fueled an interest in interventions aimed at mitigating these harmful consequences. Psychosocial interventions aimed at alleviating the negative impacts of poverty on children are frequently shown to be of benefit, but effect sizes are typically small to moderate. However, averaging outcomes over an entire sample, as is typically done, could underestimate efficacy because weaker effects on less susceptible individuals would dilute estimation of effects on those more disposed to respond. This study investigates whether a genetic polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene moderates susceptibility to a psychosocial intervention.Methods and findingsWe reanalyzed data from a randomized controlled trial of a home-visiting program delivered by community health workers in a black, isiXhosa-speaking population in Khayelitsha, South Africa. The intervention, designed to enhance maternal-infant attachment, began in the third trimester and continued until 6 mo postpartum. Implemented between April 1999 and February 2003, the intervention comprised 16 home visits delivered to 220 mother-infant dyads by specially trained community health workers. A control group of 229 mother-infant dyads did not receive the intervention. Security of maternal-infant attachment was the main outcome measured at infant age 18 mo. Compared to controls, infants in the intervention group were significantly more likely to be securely attached to their primary caregiver (odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, p = 0.029, 95% CI [1.06, 2.76], d = 0.29). After the trial, 162 intervention and 172 control group children were reenrolled in a follow-up study at 13 y of age (December 2012-June 2014). At this time, DNA collected from 279 children (134 intervention and 145 control) was genotyped for a common serotonin transporter polymorphism. There were both genetic data and attachment security data for 220 children (110 intervention and 110 control), of whom 40% (44 intervention and 45 control) carried at least one short allele of the serotonin transporter gene. For these 220 individuals, carrying at least one short allele of the serotonin transporter gene was associated with a 26% higher rate of attachment security relative to controls (OR = 3.86, p = 0.008, 95% CI [1.42, 10.51], d = 0.75), whereas there was a negligible (1%) difference in security between intervention and control group individuals carrying only the long allele (OR = 0.95, p = 0.89, 95% CI [0.45, 2.01], d = 0.03). Expressed in terms of absolute risk, for those with the short allele, the probability of secure attachment being observed in the intervention group was 84% (95% CI [73%, 95%]), compared to 58% (95% CI [43%, 72%]) in the control group. For those with two copies of the long allele, 70% (95% CI [59%, 81%]) were secure in the intervention group, compared to 71% (95% CI [60%, 82%]) of infants in the control group. Controlling for sex, maternal genotype, and indices of socioeconomic adversity (housing, employment, education, electricity, water) did not change these results. A limitation of this study is that we were only able to reenroll 49% of the original sample randomized to the intervention and control conditions. Attribution of the primary outcome to causal effects of intervention in the present subsample should therefore be treated with caution.ConclusionsWhen infant genotype for serotonin transporter polymorphism was taken into account, the effect size of a maternal-infant attachment intervention targeting impoverished pregnant women increased more than 2.5-fold when only short allele carriers were considered (from d = 0.29 for all individuals irrespective of genotype to d = 0.75) and decreased 10-fold when only those carrying two copies of the long allele were considered (from d = 0.29 for all individuals to d = 0.03). Genetic differential susceptibility means that averaging across all participants is a misleading index of efficacy. The study raises questions about how policymakers deal with the challenge of balancing equity (equal treatment for all) and efficacy (treating only those whose genes render them likely to benefit) when implementing psychosocial interventions.","Morgan, Barak; Kumsta, Robert; Fearon, Pasco; Moser, Dirk; Skeen, Sarah; Cooper, Peter; Murray, Lynne; Moran, Greg; Tomlinson, Mark",0,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002237,1012
1323,"GAME (Goals - Activity - Motor Enrichment): protocol of a single blind randomised controlled trial of motor training, parent education and environmental enrichment for infants at high risk of cerebral palsy","Background: Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability of childhood and early detection is possible using evidence based assessments. Systematic reviews indicate early intervention trials rarely demonstrate efficacy for improving motor outcomes but environmental enrichment interventions appear promising. This study is built on a previous pilot study and has been designed to assess the effectiveness of a goal - oriented motor training and enrichment intervention programme, ""GAME"", on the motor outcomes of infants at very high risk of cerebral palsy (CP) compared with standard community based care.Methods/design: A two group, single blind randomised controlled trial (n = 30) will be conducted. Eligible infants are those diagnosed with CP or designated ""at high risk of CP"" on the basis of the General Movements Assessment and/or abnormal neuroimaging. A physiotherapist and occupational therapist will deliver home-based GAME intervention at least fortnightly until the infant's first birthday. The intervention aims to optimize motor function and engage parents in developmental activities aimed at enriching the home learning environment. Primary endpoint measures will be taken 16 weeks after intervention commences with the secondary endpoint at 12 months and 24 months corrected age. The primary outcome measure will be the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale second edition. Secondary outcomes measures include the Gross Motor Function Measure, Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Affordances in the Home Environment for Motor Development - Infant Scale, and the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. Parent well-being will be monitored using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale.Discussion: This paper presents the background, design and intervention protocol of a randomised trial of a goal driven, motor learning approach with customised environmental interventions and parental education for young infants at high risk of cerebral palsy.","Morgan, Catherine; Novak, Iona; Dale, Russell C.; Guzzetta, Andrea; Badawi, Nadia",0,10.1186/s12883-014-0203-2,1013
1324,Structured skills training for adults with ADHD in an outpatient psychiatric context: an open feasibility trial,"The aim of the current study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy-based skills training groups for adults with ADHD in an outpatient psychiatric context. Furthermore, the purpose was to analyze the impact of clinical characteristics on the effect and attrition. Ninety-eight adults (out of 102) with ADHD were allocated to the treatment. Self-rating scales were administered as baseline before the first session (T1), post-treatment (T2), and at 3-month follow-up (T3). Approximately 80Â % (74 individuals) attended at least two-thirds of the sessions. Treatment satisfaction was good. ADHD symptoms and ADHD-related functional impairment in every-day life were reduced. Well-being, ability to be mindful, acceptance of emotions and quality of life were increased. The results were stable at 3-month follow-up. None of the predictors, i.e., age, comorbidity, ADHD medication status, IQ-level, treatment credibility, or functional impairment at the beginning of treatment, significantly predicted treatment outcome (change in ADHD symptoms from T1 to T2). Likewise, none of the predictors, i.e., irritability/aggression, comorbidity, and functional impairment, were significantly associated with attrition. Due to the difficulties in predicting treatment outcome, as well as attrition, based on clinical characteristics, broad inclusion criteria should be applied.

1326,Depressive symptomatology mediates associations with community reintegration in veterans with TBI,"Community reintegration (CR) is a challenge for military veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, bodily pain, and limitations in physical functioning-common comorbidities with TBI in veterans-have all been associated with problems in CR, but their interrelationships are unclear. The role of depression as a possible mediator of effects on CR has not been examined. We tested depressive symptoms as a possible mediator of CR's associations with physical limitations, PTSD, and bodily pain. This cross-sectional study used baseline data from a larger randomized controlled trial that evaluated the impact of an in-home intervention for veterans with TBI and their families. Eighty-three military veterans with TBI recruited from a medical rehabilitation service at an urban U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs medical center participated in the study. Interview instruments measured CR, depressive symptoms, physical limitations (limitations in physical functioning), bodily pain, quality of the relationship with key family members, and sociodemographic characteristics. PTSD was determined through review of the electronic medical record. Interview data were collected in veterans' homes. Depressive symptoms totally mediated the association between physical limitations and CR and the association between PTSD and CR. The bodily pain-CR association was not significant after quality of relationship had been entered into the regression models. Findings suggest that interventions to increase CR of veterans with TBI should address depression, a treatable condition. Replication of our mediation findings in larger veteran and civilian samples with TBI is needed.

1327,A pilot study of an interactive web site in the workplace for reducing alcohol consumption,"An interactive web-site-based intervention for reducing alcohol consumption was pilot tested. Participants were 145 employees of a work site in the Silicon Valley region of California, categorized as low or moderate risk for alcohol problems. All participants were given access to a web site that provided feedback on their levels of stress and use of coping strategies. Participants randomized to the full individualized feedback condition also received individualized feedback about their risk for alcohol-related problems. Some evidence was found for greater alcohol reduction among participants who received full individualized feedback, although due to difficulties in recruiting participants, the sample size was inadequate for evaluating treatment effects on drinking. The results provide preliminary support for using an interactive web site to provide individualized feedback for persons at risk for alcohol problems. However, the low participation rate (2.7%) suggests that such an intervention must address the challenges of recruiting employees through their work site. Â© 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The current study created a cold condition to examine the impact of cold stress on driving behavior. Forty-four participants drove a high-fidelity driving simulator during a thermal neutral or local torso cooled condition. Participants performed additional tasks to assess attention, psychomotor vigilance, and manual dexterity. Skin temperature was significantly lower in the cold condition while internal temperature was unaffected. Participants who had higher subjective ratings of cold followed lead vehicles closer and started to brake later. Participants in the cold condition followed the lead car 22% (0.82 s) closer and started braking 20% (2.35 s) later when approaching a stop sign during the car-following task. No change in attention, psychomotor vigilance, or dexterity was observed. The current results suggest that cold environmental conditions can contribute to dangerous driving behaviors. Measures of cold perception were also shown to predict changes in driving behavior. Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Morris D.M., Pilcher J.J.",0,10.1016/j.biopsycho.2016.09.011,1018

Even when medication, diet, and physical activity regimens are maintained, blood sugar levels might not be effectively controlled because stress triggers the release of sugar into the blood. This makes the management of stress an important adjunct to the treatment of T2DM. Stress includes both life stress, the major issues that people face in their lives, such as job loss, divorce, or death of a loved one, and daily hassles, smaller everyday problems, such as deadlines for work, traffic hold-ups, or family disagreements. The stress levels created by these events are exacerbated by the stress created by the demands of managing diabetes. In this paper, we first examine the evidence for the relationship between stress and poor blood sugar control in people with T2DM. Then, we consider research that has examined the impact of various stress management strategies on blood sugar level. Finally, we discuss some promising psychological techniques for managing stress that could be helpful for people with diabetes or pre-diabetes. We note the double benefit of physical activity, which directly assists in the metabolism of sugar from the blood and indirectly reduces acute stress and chronic stress reactivity, thus providing a buffer against the effects of stress for people with T2DM.

1333,Impact of Sleepwise: An intervention for youth with developmental disabilities and sleep disturbance,"The prevalence of sleep disturbance among children with developmental disabilities is known to be considerably higher than the typical population. The current study examined the effectiveness of the Sleepwise intervention program (O'Connell and Vannan in Aust Occup Ther J 55:212-214, 2008): a parent-assisted group-based treatment for sleep disturbance which was recently adapted for older children and adolescents with DD. Twenty-six families with children aged 8-17 years participated. The study compared a treatment and a wait-list control group at baseline, post-treatment and 2 months post-treatment on measures of child and parent functioning. Results demonstrated that the Sleepwise approach was effective in reducing sleep disturbance and parent stress. Limitations and future research directions are discussed.

1334,Site-specific muscle hyper-reactivity in musicians with occupational upper limb pain,"Fourteen musicians who reported a history of pain in the upper limb associated with the playing of their instruments were compared with a sample of pain-free musicians, matched for age, sex and musical instrument. Four tasks were presented in random order and included neutral, general stressor, personal stressor and pain stressor tasks. Ratings of stressfulness and recordings of skin conductance level confirmed the effectiveness of the experimental manipulations for both subject groups. No differences were found between groups or tasks for frontalis surface electromyograph (EMG) activity. Evidence was found, however, of EMG elevation in flexor and trapezius muscles on the pain side for the pain subjects, in response to the task involving recall of a pain experience. This elevation was not found for the pain-free controls or for other stressor tasks, although some elevation in response to the pain stressor task was found for pain subjects in the trapezius muscles of the non-pain side. The duration of return to baseline of EMG following the pain stressor task was found to be extended in pain subjects for the trapezius, but not for the flexor muscles of the pain side. The findings suggest that site-specific muscle hyper-reactivity may play a role in the development and maintenance of occupational upper limb pain in musicians.

1335,Trauma tips: An internet-based intervention to prevent Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in injured trauma patients,"In the prevention of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after severe traumatic injury, easily applicable, accessible, cost-efficient early interventions are needed that use well-established techniques for decreasing acute psychological stress reactions. Whereas most studies delivered cognitive behavioral techniques face-to-face or as a curative treatment, we incorporated them into a brief Internet-based early intervention program to reduce acute psychological distress and prevent long-term symptoms of PTSD in trauma victims. By means of interactive elements, visual and auditory materials, the intervention contains psychoeducation, modeling, in vivo exposure, stress management and social support. In this article, we describe the design of the program and the outcomes of an initial feasibility study among trauma patients (n = 5) and healthy controls (n = 5). The participants reviewed the program as useful and clear. Neither patients nor controls experienced adverse psychological reactions after completing the intervention. The results show that the intervention is well-received and feasible for implementation in severely injured trauma survivors.

1336,Oxidative & nitrosative stress in depression: Why so much stress?,"Many studies support a crucial role for oxidative & nitrosative stress (O&NS) in the pathophysiology of unipolar and bipolar depression. These disorders are characterized inter alia by lowered antioxidant defenses, including: lower levels of zinc, coenzyme Q10, vitamin E and glutathione increased lipid peroxidation; damage to proteins, DNA and mitochondria; secondary autoimmune responses directed against redox modified nitrosylated proteins and oxidative specific epitopes. This review examines and details a model through which a complex series of environmental factors and biological pathways contribute to increased redox signaling and consequently increased O&NS in mood disorders. This multi-step process highlights the potential for future interventions that encompass a diverse range of environmental and molecular targets in the treatment of depression.

1337,"Exercising the worry away: How inflammation, oxidative and nitrogen stress mediates the beneficial effect of physical activity on anxiety disorder symptoms and behaviours","Regular physical activity exerts positive effects on anxiety disorder symptoms, although the biological mechanisms underpinning this effect are incompletely understood. Numerous lines of evidence support inflammation and oxidative and nitrogen stress (O&NS) as important in the pathogenesis of mood and anxiety disorders, and physical activity is known to influence these same pathways. This paper reviews the inter-relationships between anxiety disorders, physical activity and inflammation and O&NS, to explore whether modulation of inflammation and O&NS may in part underpin the positive effect of physical activity on anxiety disorders. Numerous studies support the notion that physical activity operates as an anti-inflammatory and anti-O&NS agent which potentially exerts positive effects on neuroplasticity, the expression of neurotrophins and normal neuronal functions. These effects may therefore influence the expression and evolution of anxiety disorders. Further exploration of this area may elicit a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders, and inform the development of integrated programmes including PA specifically suited to the treatment and prevention of anxiety disorders and symptoms.

1338,Computer-assisted resilience training to prepare healthcare workers for pandemic influenza: a randomized trial of the optimal dose of training,"Background: Working in a hospital during an extraordinary infectious disease outbreak can cause significant stress and contribute to healthcare workers choosing to reduce patient contact. Psychological training of healthcare workers prior to an influenza pandemic may reduce stress-related absenteeism, however, established training methods that change behavior and attitudes are too resource-intensive for widespread use. This study tests the feasibility and effectiveness of a less expensive alternative-an interactive, computer-assisted training course designed to build resilience to the stresses of working during a pandemic.Methods: A ""dose-finding"" study compared pre-post changes in three different durations of training. We measured variables that are likely to mediate stress-responses in a pandemic before and after training: confidence in support and training, pandemic-related self-efficacy, coping style and interpersonal problems.Results: 158 hospital workers took the course and were randomly assigned to the short (7 sessions, median cumulative duration 111 minutes), medium (12 sessions, 158 minutes) or long (17 sessions, 223 minutes) version. Using an intention-to-treat analysis, the course was associated with significant improvements in confidence in support and training, pandemic self-efficacy and interpersonal problems. Participants who under-utilized coping via problem-solving or seeking support or over-utilized escape-avoidance experienced improved coping. Comparison of doses showed improved interpersonal problems in the medium and long course but not in the short course. There was a trend towards higher drop-out rates with longer duration of training.Conclusions: Computer-assisted resilience training in healthcare workers appears to be of significant benefit and merits further study under pandemic conditions. Comparing three ""doses"" of the course suggested that the medium course was optimal.","Maunder, Robert G.; Lancee, William J.; Mae, Reet; Vincent, Leslie; Peladeau, Nathalie; Beduz, Mary Agnes; Hunter, Jonathan J.; Leszcz, Molyn",1,10.1186/1472-6963-10-72,1026
1339,Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) in complex systems: Cultural adaptation and safety impacts in healthcare,"In complex systems, such as hospitals or air traffic control operations, critical incidents (Cis) are unavoidable. These incidents can not only become critical for victims but also for professionals working at the ""sharp end"" who may have to deal with critical incident stress (CIS) reactions that may be severe and impede emotional, physical, cognitive and social functioning. These CIS reactions may occur not only under exceptional conditions but also during every-day work and become an important safety issue. In contrast to air traffic management (ATM) operations in Europe, which have readily adopted critical incident stress management (CISM), most hospitals have not yet implemented comprehensive peer support programs. This survey was conducted in 2010 at the only European general hospital setting which implemented CISM program since 2004. The aim of the article is to describe possible contribution of CISM in hospital settings framed from the perspective of organizational safety and individual health for healthcare professionals. Findings affirm that daily work related incidents also can become critical for healthcare professionals. Program efficiency appears to be influenced by the professional culture, as well as organizational structure and policies. Overall, findings demonstrate that the adaptation of the CISM program in general hospitals takes time but, once established, it may serve as a mechanism for changing professional culture, thereby permitting the framing of even small incidents or near misses as an opportunity to provide valuable feedback to the system.

Interventions targeting specific domains of functioning, age groups, stages of illness, and human service system gaps are classified as evidence-based practices or promising practices according to the extent to which their efficacy is currently supported by meta-analyses and individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Evidence-based practices include assertive community treatment (ACT), cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for psychosis, cognitive remediation, family psychoeducation, illness self-management training, social skills training, and supported employment. Promising practices include cognitive adaptive therapy, CBT for posttraumatic stress disorder, first-episode psychosis intervention, healthy lifestyle interventions, integrated treatment for co-occurring disorders, interventions targeting older individuals, peer support services, physical disease management, prodromal stage intervention, social cognition training, supported education, and supported housing.

1341,Evaluating an employee wellness program,"What criteria should be used to evaluate the impact of a new employee wellness program when the initial vendor contract expires? Published academic literature focuses on return-on-investment as the gold standard for wellness program evaluation, and a recent meta-analysis concludes that wellness programs can generate net savings after one or two years. In contrast, surveys indicate that fewer than half of these programs report net savings, and actuarial analysts argue that return-on-investment is an unrealistic metric for evaluating new programs. These analysts argue that evaluation of new programs should focus on contract management issues, such as the vendor's ability to: (i) recruit employees to participate and (ii) induce behavior change. We compute difference-in-difference propensity score matching estimates of the impact of a wellness program implemented by a mid-sized employer. The analysis includes one year of pre-implementation data and three years of post-implementation data. We find that the program successfully recruited a broad spectrum of employees to participate, and it successfully induced short-term behavior change, as manifested by increased preventive screening. However, the effects on health care expenditures are positive (but insignificant). If it is unrealistic to expect new programs to significantly reduce healthcare costs in a few years, then focusing on return-on-investment as the gold standard metric may lead to early termination of potentially useful wellness programs. Focusing short-term analysis of new programs on short-term measures may provide a more realistic evaluation strategy.","Mukhopadhyay, S; Wendel, J",0,10.1007/s10754-013-9127-4,1029

Studies demonstrate that Workrelated stress can have a negative effect on the quality of life, productivity, and as a result lead to considerable socioeconomic consequences. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of a brief stress management intervention on work-related stress in employees of Isfahan Steel Company in Iran. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was used to compare the intervention group with the control group. Eighty-eight employees of Blast Furnaces were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 44) and control groups (n = 44) and completed Occupational Role Questionnaire before and after A brief three-session CB (Cognitive behavioral) stress management. RESULTS: After the intervention significant differences were detected between the control and intervention groups in role overloud, role insufficiency, role boundary, and responsibility but not in role ambiguity and physical environment. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the brief stress management intervention can be considered as a preliminary education for employees to develop skills to cope with role overloud, role insufficiency, role boundary, and responsibility, which are some of the factors of work-related stress.","Mazaheri M.A., Darani F.M., Eslami A.A.",1,,1030
1343,"Depressive symptoms in mothers of pre-school children. Effects of deprivation, social support, stress and neighbourhood social capital","Background: Depressive symptoms in mothers of young children can have serious consequences for the health of the child. In particular, children whose mothers are experiencing depressive symptoms are at significantly greater risk of poisoning and accidental injury. A mother's risk of developing depressive symptoms has been shown to be related to socio-economic disadvantage, high levels of stress and a perceived lack of social support. Residents who perceive their neighbourhoods to be of low social capital are more likely to report poor mental health. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between maternal depressive symptoms, deprivation, social support, stress and neighbourhood social capital in a group of mothers living in deprived areas of Nottingham, United Kingdom (UK). Design and setting: A postal questionnaire at entry to a randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessed socio-demographic characteristics and a second questionnaire, 21 months later, assessed depressive symptoms, perceived lack of social support, self-reported stress and individual- level assessment of neighbourhood social capital. Participants: A total of 846 mothers of young children living in deprived areas in Nottingham, UK, enrolled in the control group of an RCT. Results: One-third of mothers reported high levels of depressive symptoms. Neighbourhood-level deprivation and receiving means-tested benefits were independently associated with maternal depressive symptoms. A lack of social support and high levels of self-reported stress were also strongly associated with depressive symptoms. Individual-level assessment of neighbourhood social capital was not associated with depressive symptoms amongst mothers after adjusting for self-reported stress. Conclusions: Neighbourhood- and individual-level variables of deprivation and psychological distress are more important than mother's assessment of the social capital of the neighbourhood in which she lives in determining the risk of depressive symptoms. Interventions aimed at supporting mothers of young children may be more effective at reducing the risks of depressive symptoms and consequent risks to the child's health than interventions aimed at improving a neighbourhood's social capital.

1344,Adult anxiety disorders in relation to trait anxiety and perceived stress in childhood,"It is well established that objective early life stressors increase risk for anxiety disorders and that environmental stressors interact with dispositional factors such as trait anxiety. There is less information on how subjective perception of stress during childhood relates to later clinical anxiety. This study tested whether childhood perceived stress and trait anxiety were independently and interactively associated with adult anxiety disorders. Forty-seven adults diagnosed with anxiety disorders (M age = 34 yr., SD = 11) and 29 healthy participants (M = 33 yr., SD = 13) completed the adult Perceived Stress Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Global Perceived Early Life Events Scale as a measure of perceived stress during childhood. In a logistic regression model, high childhood perceived stress (Î² = 0.64) and trait anxiety (Î² = 0.11) were associated with significantly greater odds of adult anxiety disorder. The association between childhood perceived stress and adult anxiety remained significant when controlling for adult perceived stress. These findings suggest that children's perception of stress in their daily lives may be an important target of intervention to prevent the progression of stress into clinically significant anxiety.

1345,Effectiveness and experiences of families and support workers participating in peer-led parenting support programs delivered as home visiting programs: a comprehensive systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Designing child and family health services to meet the diverse needs of contemporary families is intended to minimize impacts of early disadvantage and subsequent lifelong health and social issues. Innovative programs to engage families with child and family support services have led to interest in the potential value of peer-led home visiting from parents in local communities. There is a range of benefits and challenges identified in a limited number of studies associated with home visiting peer support.OBJECTIVES: The objective of the review is to identify: INCLUSION CRITERIA PARTICIPANTS: Families/parents with one or more children aged zero to four years, peer support workers and their supervisors.INTERVENTION AND PHENOMENON OF INTEREST: Peer-led home visiting parenting support programs that use volunteer or paraprofessional home visitors from the local community compared to standard community maternal-child care. The phenomenon of interest will be the relationships between participants in the program.TYPES OF STUDIES: Quantitative studies: randomized control trials (RCTs). Qualitative studies: grounded theory and qualitative descriptive studies.OUTCOMES: Parental attitudes and beliefs, coping skills and confidence in parenting, parental stress, compliance with child health checks/links with primary healthcare services, satisfaction with peer support and services and the nature of the relationship between parents and home visitors.SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy will include both published and unpublished studies. Seven journal databases and five other sources will be searched. Only studies published in the English language from 2000 to 2015 will be considered.METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Studies were assessed by two independent reviewers using standardized critical appraisal tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) and the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI) as appropriate.DATA EXTRACTION: Both quantitative and qualitative data were independently extracted by two reviewers using standardized data extraction tools from the JBI-MAStARI and the JBI-QARI, respectively, including qualitative and quantitative details about setting of interventions, phenomena of interest, participants, study methods and outcomes or findings.DATA SYNTHESIS: For quantitative findings, statistical pooling was not possible due to differences in interventions and outcome measures. Findings were presented in narrative form. Qualitative findings were aggregated into categories based on similarity of meaning from which synthesized findings were generated.RESULTS: Quantitative results from two RCTs demonstrated positive impacts of peer-led home visiting parent support programs including more positive parenting attitudes and beliefs, and more child preventative health care visits.Fifteen qualitative findings from two studies were aggregated into five categories from which two synthesized findings emerged. Parents and home visitors identified similar components as contributing to their program's success, these being quality of relationships between parents and home visitors with elements being mutual respect, trust and being valued within the partnership. In addition, home visitors identified importance of enabling strategies to develop relationships. They also needed supportive working environments with clinical staff and management.CONCLUSION: The current review indicates a positive impact of peer-led home visiting parent support programs, incorporating a framework of partnership between parents and home visitors, on mother-infant dyads. Positive changes in parenting attitudes and beliefs, and increased number of child preventative healthcare visits are supported by the quality of the relationship between parent and home visitor, and home visitors' working environments.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The essential characteristics of an effective parent support program are strategies for relationship building between parents and home visitors; ongoing staff and home visitor education to enhance communication, collaboration and working in partnership; supervision by team leaders; and continuous quality improvement.IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: The focus of further research should be on confirmatory studies using an action research methodology and the cost-effectiveness of these models.","Munns, Ailsa; Watts, Robin; Hegney, Desley; Walker, Roz",0,,1033
1347,A common elements treatment approach for adult mental health problems in low- and middle-income countries,"This paper describes the Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) for adults presenting with mood or anxiety problems developed specifically for use with lay counselors in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Details of the intervention development, training, supervision, and decision-making process are presented. Case vignettes are used as examples throughout. Preliminary findings are presented on counselor/supervisor performance and client outcomes from practice cases completed prior to randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted at two sites for adult survivors of torture and/or systematic violence in (a) southern Iraq and (b) Thailand-Burma border.Data suggest that local supervisors and lay counselors with little prior mental health training or experience maintained fidelity to the model. The majority of pilot clients were retained in treatment, suggesting acceptability. Using the Reliable Change Index (RCI) for each individual we examined the number of clients above a minimal threshold (z>. 1.96) for each outcome. In Iraq 100% of clients had RCIs above the threshold for depression and posttraumatic stress, and 81.8% for impaired function. In Thailand, 81.3% of clients had RCIs above minimum threshold for depression, 68.8% for posttraumatic stress, and 37.5% for impaired function.Implementation of CETA is discussed in relation to cultural issues within LMIC. These findings, combined with US-based evidence, suggest that a common elements approach warrants further development and testing as a means for addressing the treatment gap for mental health problems in LMIC.

1348,Acceptance and mindfulness-based stress management for support staff caring for individuals with intellectual disabilities,"Support staff working with individuals with intellectual disability (ID) and challenging behaviour experience high levels of work-related stress. Preliminary theoretical and experimental research has highlighted the potential suitability of acceptance and mindfulness approaches for addressing support staff stress. This study examines the effectiveness of an acceptance and mindfulness-based stress management workshop on the levels of psychological distress and well-being of support staff working with individuals with ID and challenging behaviour. Support staff (n= 120) were randomly assigned to a workshop intervention condition (n= 66) or to a waiting list control condition (n= 54). Measurements were completed at three time points (pre-, post and 6 week follow-up) for: psychological distress, well-being, perceived work stressors, thought suppression, and emotional avoidance/psychological inflexibility. Main Findings: The intervention led to significantly greater reductions in distress in the intervention group than in the control group. This was largely maintained at 6 week follow-up. This effect was more pronounced amongst a subsample that had shown higher levels of psychological distress at baseline. Thought suppression was found to reduce significantly in the intervention group between post intervention and follow-up, although no significant change was found in well-being or experiential avoidance/psychological inflexibility. Overall, results demonstrated support for the effectiveness of an acceptance and mindfulness-based intervention in reducing distress.

Semistructured interviews were conducted with local counselors trained in TF-CBT (NÂ =Â 19; 90% of those trained; 12 female) and children/caregivers who had received TF-CBT in a small feasibility study (NÂ =Â 18; 86% of the children and NÂ =Â 16; 76% of the caregivers) who completed TF-CBT (total completed; NÂ =Â 21). Each client was asked six open-ended questions, and domain analysis was used to explore the data. Counselors were positive about the program, liked the structure and flexibility, reported positive changes in their clients, and discussed the cultural adaptation around activities and language. Counselors stated the training was too short, and the supervision was necessary. Challenges included client engagement and attendance, availability of location, funding, and a lack of community understanding of â€œtherapy.â€ Children and caregivers stated multiple positive changes they attributed to TF-CBT, such as better family communication, reduction of problem behaviors, and ability to speak about the trauma. They recommended continuing the program. This study brings a critical examination of providersâ€™ and clientsâ€™ perspectives of the implementation of an EBT for children in a low-resource setting. Clinical implications include changing implementation methods based on responses. Research implications include future study directions such as an effectiveness trial of TF-CBT and an examination of implementation factors.

We evaluated a community-based, translational stress management program to improve health-related quality of life in Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer. Methods. We adapted a cognitive-behavioral stress management program integrating evidence-based and community best practices to address the needs of Latinas with breast cancer. Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer were randomly assigned to an intervention or usual-care control group. Trained peers delivered the 8-week intervention between February 2011 and February 2014. Primary outcomes were breast cancer-specific quality of life and distress, and general symptoms of distress. Results. Of 151 participants, 95% were retained at 6 months (between May 2011 and May 2014). Improvements in quality of life from baseline to 6 months were greater for the intervention than the control group on physical well-being, emotional well-being, breast cancer concerns, and overall quality of life. Decreases from baseline to 6 months were greater for the intervention group on depression and somatization. Conclusions. Results suggest that translation of evidence-based programs can reduce psychosocial health disparities in Latinas with breast cancer.

1351,Randomized controlled trial of Nuevo Amanecer: A peer-delivered stress management intervention for Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer,"Background Latinas with breast cancer suffer symptom and psychosocial health disparities. Effective interventions have not been developed for or tested in this population. Purpose We describe community-based participatory research methods used to develop and implement the Nuevo Amanecer program, a culturally tailored, peerdelivered cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention for low-income Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer, and unique considerations in implementing a randomized controlled trial to test the program in community settings. Methods We applied an implementation science framework to delineate the methodological phases used to develop and implement the Nuevo Amanecer program and trial, emphasizing community engagement processes. Results In phase 1, we established project infrastructure: Academic and community co-principal investigators, community partners, community advisory board, steering committee, and funding. In phase 2, we identified three program inputs: formative research, a community best-practices model, and an evidence-based intervention tested in non-Latinas. In phase 3, we created the new program by integrating and adapting intervention components from the three sources, making adaptations to accommodate low literacy, Spanish language, cultural factors, community context, and population needs. In phase 4, we built community capacity for the program and trial by training field staff (recruiters and interventionists embedded in community sites), compensating field staff, and creating a system for identifying potential participants. In phase 5, we implemented and monitored the program and trial. Engaging community partners in all phases has resulted in a new, culturally tailored program that is suitable for newly diagnosed Latinas with breast cancer and a trial that is acceptable and supported by community and clinical partners. Lessons learned Engagement of community-based organizations and cancer survivors as research partners and hiring recruiters and interventionists from the community were critical to successful implementation in community settings. Having culturally and linguistically competent research staff with excellent interpersonal skills facilitated implementation. Facilitating and maintaining excellent communication among community partners was imperative to troubleshoot implementation issues. Randomization was challenging due to community concerns about assigning women to a control group. Patient privacy regulations and the need for extensive outreach to establish relationships between community partners and clinical sites hampered initial recruitment. Limitations These were resource-intensive processes to develop and implement the program that need to be compared to less-intensive alternatives. Conclusion Engaging community members in design and implementation of community-based programs and trials enhances cultural appropriateness and congruence with the community context. If the randomized trial demonstrates that the intervention is effective, it will fill a gap in evidence-based programs to address ethnic disparities in quality of life among Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer.

Conclusions were limited by an ambiguous definition of compassion fatigue that fails to adequately differentiate it from related constructs (e.g. burnout, secondary traumatic stress) and the modest number of cancer-related studies found. However, evidence suggests that compassion fatigue takes a toll not only on cancer-care providers but also on the workplace. These findings highlight the need to understand more clearly the link between the empathic sensitivity of healthcare professionals and their vulnerability to compassion fatigue.

1354,Development of a 2-h suicide prevention program for medical staff including nurses and medical residents: A two-center pilot trial,"Background: Suicide is a crucial global health concern and effective suicide prevention has long been warranted. Mental illness, especially depression is the highest risk factor of suicide. Suicidal risk is increased in people not only with mental illness but also with physical illnesses, thus medical staff caring for physically-ill patients are also required to manage people with suicidal risk. In the present study, we evaluated our newly developed suicide intervention program among medical staff.Methods: We developed a 2-h suicide intervention program for medical staff, based on the Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), which had originally been developed for the general population. We conducted this program for 74 medical staff members from 2 hospitals. Changes in knowledge, perceived skills, and confidence in early intervention of depression and suicide-prevention were evaluated using self-reported questionnaires at 3 points; pre-program, immediately after the program, and 1 month after program.Results: This suicide prevention program had significant effects on improving perceived skills and confidence especially among nurses and medical residents. These significant effects lasted even 1 month after the program.Limitations: Design was a single-arm study with relatively small sample size and short-term follow up.Conclusions: The present study suggests that the major target of this effective program is nurses and medical residents. Future research is required to validate the effects of the program with control groups, and also to assess long-term effectiveness and actual reduction in suicide rates.","Nakagami, Yukako; Kubo, Hiroaki; Katsuki, Ryoko; Sakai, Tomomichi; Sugihara, Genichi; Naito, Chisako; Oda, Hiroyuki; Hayakawa, Kohei; Suzuki, Yuriko; Fujisawa, Daisuke; Hashimoto, Naoki; Kobara, Keiji; Cho, Tetsuji; Kuga, Hironori; Takao, Kiyoshi; Kawahara, Yoko; Matsumura, Yumi; Murai, Toshiya; Akashi, Koichi; Kanba, Shigenobu; Otsuka, Kotaro; Kato, Takahiro A.",0,10.1016/j.jad.2017.08.074,1040
1355,Two sessions of sleep-focused mind-body bridging improve self-reported symptoms of sleep and PTSD in veterans: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"Objective: Sleep disturbance is highly prevalent among veterans. As an alternative to sleep medications with their undesirable side effects, nonpharmacological mind-body interventions may be beneficial for sleep management in primary care. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate whether a novel mind-body intervention, mind-body bridging (MBB), focusing on sleep, could improve self-reported sleep disturbance and comorbid symptoms in veterans. Methods: This pilot study was a randomized controlled trial at the Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Health Care System in which 63 veterans with self-reported sleep disturbance received MBB or an active sleep education control. Both interventions were conducted in two sessions, once per week. Patient-reported outcomes included the following: primary-Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Survey, MOS Short Form-36V; secondary Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression, PTSD Check List Military, Five-Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire. Results: At both Week 1 (1 week after the first session) and post-intervention assessments, while sleep disturbance decreased in both groups, MBB performed significantly better than did the control group. Furthermore, self-reported PTSD symptoms improved in MBB, while they remained unchanged in the control. Overall mindfulness increased in MBB, while it remained unchanged in the control. Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that a brief sleep-focused MBB could be a promising intervention for sleep and potentially other comorbid symptoms (e.g., PTSD). MBB could help patients develop awareness skills to deal with sleep-related symptoms. Integration of MBB into primary care settings may enhance care of patients with sleep disturbance and co-morbid symptoms. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

1356,Stress-reduction psychoeducational interventions for Black working women,"Stress-reduction psychoeducation as a lifestyle modification intervention highlights multiple sources of stress. This article focuses on stress-reduction psychoeducation for Black women and supports the development of culture- and gender-appropriate community interventions as viable methods for stress reduction. The intervention helped participants verbalize strategies for reducing role conflict such as establishing priorities, partitioning and separating roles, overlooking role demands, and changing attitudes toward roles in order to maximize satisfaction in a specific role. Nurses who provide care for Black women in acute care settings, mental health settings, clinics, and occupational settings are in key positions to identify psychological symptomatology related to negative mental health responses associated with multiple role occupancy for at-risk groups of Black working women. Psychoeducational support groups may be a viable alternative to facilitate the problem solving and the support once afforded by informal support networks.","Napholz, L",0,10.1016/S0029-6465(01)00006-8,1042
1357,Review of VA/DOD clinical practice guideline on management of acute stress and interventions to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder,"This article summarizes the recommendations of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)/Department of Defense (DOD) VA/DOD Clinical Practice Guideline for Management of Post-Traumatic Stress that pertain to acute stress and the prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder, including screening and early interventions for acute stress states in various settings. Recommended interventions during the first 4 days after a potentially traumatic event include attending to safety and basic needs and providing access to physical, emotional, and social resources. Psychological first aid is recommended for management of acute stress, while psychological debriefing is discouraged. Further medical and psychiatric assessment and provision of brief, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy are warranted if clinically significant distress or functional impairment persists or worsens after 2 days or if the criteria for a diagnosis of acute stress disorder are met. Follow-up monitoring and rescreening are endorsed for at least 6 months for everyone who experiences significant acute posttraumatic stress. Four interventions that illustrate early intervention principles contained in the VA/DOD Clinical Practice Guideline are described.","Nash W.P., Watson P.J.",0,10.1682/JRRD.2011.10.0194,1043

Digital technology holds promise for improving access to, and quality of, mental health care. We reviewed evidence on the use of mobile, online, and other remote technologies for treatment and prevention of mental disorders in low-income and middle-income countries. Of the 49 studies identified, most were preliminary evaluations of feasibility and acceptability. The findings were promising, showing the potential effectiveness of online, text-messaging, and telephone support interventions. We summarised the evaluations as: technology for supporting clinical care and educating health workers, mobile tools for facilitating diagnosis and detection of mental disorders, technologies for promoting treatment adherence and supporting recovery, online self-help programmes for individuals with mental disorders, and programmes for substance misuse prevention and treatment. Continued research is needed to rigorously evaluate effectiveness, assess costs, and carefully consider potential risks of digital technology interventions for mental disorders, while determining how emerging technologies might support the scale-up of mental health treatment and prevention efforts across low-resource settings.","Naslund, John A.; Aschbrenner, Kelly A.; Araya, Ricardo; Marsch, Lisa A.; Unutzer, Jurgen; Patel, Vikram; Bartels, Stephen J.",0,10.1016/S2215-0366(17)30096-2,1044
1359,Social support and psychological functioning among high-risk mothers: The impact of the baby love maternal outreach worker program,"This study compared two groups of high-risk Medicaid-eligible mothers, 221 who participated in a maternal home visitation program and 198 who did not, to determine whether program participation was associated with improvements in the mothers' psychological functioning 1 year after delivery, and whether these improvements were associated with the type and intensity of support provided by home visitors. The results suggest that, compared to nonparticipants, participants provided with more intensive home visitor support had significantly higher self-esteem (p = 0.039) and were less depressed (p = 0.015). Participants with less intensive home visitor support, however, did not differ significantly from nonparticipants in their self-esteem or depression levels. No significant differences were observed in the perceived stress levels of participants as compared with nonparticipants, regardless of the intensity of home visitor support. Mothers who had support from the baby's father, however, had significantly lower perceived stress levels than mothers with no support from the baby's father (p = 0.046). Moreover, the type of support provided by home visitors (emotional, instrumental, informational) did not appear to be related to the mothers' psychological functioning. This study suggests that the intensity of support is an important component of maternal home visitation programs that aim to improve women's psychological functioning.","Navaie-Waliser, M; Martin, SL; Tessaro, I; Campbell, MK; Cross, AW",0,10.1046/j.1525-1446.2000.00280.x,1045

Methods: Growth curve analyses compared medical claims for participants of wellness programs versus risk-matched nonparticipants for years 2001 to 2005. The difference was used to define savings. ROI was determined by subtracting program costs from savings and alternative discount rates were applied in a sensitivity analysis. Results: Multivariate models estimated health care expenses per person per year as $176 lower for participants. Inpatient expenses were lower by $182. Four-year savings of $1,335,524 compared with program expenses of $808,403 yielded an ROI of $1.65 for every dollar spent on the program. Conclusions: Using sophisticated methodology, this study suggests that a comprehensive health promotion program can lower the rate of health care cost increases and produce a positive ROI.","Naydeck, BL; Pearson, JA; Ozminkowski, RJ; Day, BT; Goetzel, RZ",0,10.1097/JOM.0b013e3181617855,1046

This article provides a conceptual background for a specific behavioral therapy approach to family stress management in dealing with the sequelae of AMI for all family members with the goal of reducing morbidity for all family members as they cope with ongoing survivorship issues. The family intervention program is described and its pilot implementation discussed. Evaluation of the pilot suggests that an individually tailored focus for that subset of families at higher risk for elevated, persistent distress may be the most cost-effective use of such a family intervention program.

1365,Students perceived stress in academic programs: Consequences for its management,"Background. - Academic stress contributes to the deterioration of the students' quality of life. Psychological determinants involved in the stress process, trait anxiety and coping, have been neglected when assessing the role of academic programs in stress. This study aimed at determining whether academic programs are associated with a high level of perceived stress above and beyond potential personal and environmental risk factors, as well as coping strategies. Methods. - A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2009 among third-year medical (total n = 170, participants 88%), dental (n = 63, 94%), psychology (n = 331, 61%) and sports sciences (n = 312, 55%) students in Montpellier (France). The stress level experienced during the last 2 months, trait anxiety and coping strategies were appraised. Substance use, psychological care, and stress triggers were also collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Results. - Compared with medicine and after adjusting for gender and age, only the sports program was associated with a lower perceived stress risk: adjusted odds ratio: 0.54 [95% Confidence interval: 0.30; 0.99]. Substantial reductions in perceived stress risks were observed in science students after additional adjustments for non-academic stress triggers, substance use, psychological care (adjusted odds ratio: 0.20 [95% Confidence interval: 0.09; 0.41]), and also for trait anxiety and coping strategies (adjusted odds ratio: 0.23 [95% Confidence interval: 0.10; 0.54]). Compared with medicine and after these additional adjustments, psychology had a significantly lower perceived stress risk (0.34 [0.18; 0.64]; 0.40 [0.19; 0.86], respectively), dentistry had a similar risk (0.82 [0.35; 1.91]; 0.53 [0.20; 1.43], respectively). Conclusion. - Sports and psychology programs had a lower perceived stress risk compared with medicine. Personal and environmental risk factors and coping strategies modified the association between academic program and perceived stress. Developing efficient coping strategies in students and improving academic environment could contribute to prevent the potential deleterious consequences of stress. (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

1367,"A Psycho-Educational HIV/STI Prevention Intervention for Internally Displaced Women in Leogane, Haiti: Results from a Non-Randomized Cohort Pilot Study","BackgroundLittle evidence exists regarding efficacious HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) prevention interventions with internally displaced populations. Internally displaced women are at elevated risk for HIV/STI due to limited access to health services, heightened poverty and social network breakdown. The FASY (Famn an Aksyon Pou Sante' Yo) (Women Taking Action For Their Health) study examined the effectiveness of a peer health worker (PHW) delivered psycho-educational HIV/STI pilot study with internally displaced women in Leogane, Haiti.MethodThis was a non-randomized cohort pilot study. Participants completed a computer-assisted pre-test programmed on Android tablet PCs followed by an HIV/STI educational video-based session and a 6-week psycho-educational group program of weekly meetings. Participants completed a post-test upon completion of group sessions. The primary outcome was HIV knowledge; our pre-specified index of clinically significant change was an effect size of 0.30. Secondary outcomes included: STI knowledge, condom use, social support, resilient coping, depression and relationship control. We used mixed-effects regression to calculate mean outcome pre-post score change. This study was registered (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01492829).ResultsBetween January 1-April 30, 2012 we assigned 200 participants to the study. The majority of participants (n&#8202;=&#8202;176, 88%) completed the study and were followed up at 8 weeks, finishing April 30, 2012. Adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, HIV knowledge (&#946;&#8202;=&#8202;4.81; 95% CI 4.36&#8211;5.26), STI knowledge (&#946;&#8202;=&#8202;0.84; 95% CI 0.70&#8211;0.99), condom use (AOR&#8202;=&#8202;4.05, 95% CI 1.86&#8211;8.83), and depression (&#946;&#8202;=&#8202;&#8722;0.63, 95% CI &#8722;0.88&#8211;&#8722;0.39) scores showed statistically significant change post-intervention (p<0.05).ConclusionsThis pilot study evaluated a PHW psycho-educational HIV/STI prevention intervention among internally displaced women in post-earthquake Haiti. Pilot studies are an important approach to understand feasibility and scientific impacts of HIV prevention strategies in disaster contexts. Study results may inform HIV prevention interventions among internally displaced women in Haiti and can be tested for applicability with internally displaced women globally.ClinicalTrials.gov: Identifier NCT01492829, URL: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01492829?term=logie&rank=1","Newman, Peter A; Daniel, Carolann; Weaver, James; Loutfy, Mona R; Logie, Carmen H",0,,1050
1368,Co-occurrence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms with other psychopathology in young adults: Parenting style as a moderator,"The extent to which parenting styles can influence secondary psychiatric symptoms among young adults with ADHD symptoms is unknown. This issue was investigated in a sample of 2284 incoming college students (male, 50.6%), who completed standardized questionnaires about adult ADHD symptoms, other DSM-IV symptoms, and their parents' parenting styles before their ages of 16. Among them, 2.8% and 22.8% were classified as having ADHD symptoms and sub-threshold ADHD symptoms, respectively. Logistic regression was used to compare the comorbid rates of psychiatric symptoms among the ADHD, sub-threshold ADHD and non-ADHD groups while multiple linear regressions were used to examine the moderating role of gender and parenting styles over the associations between ADHD and other psychiatric symptoms. Both ADHD groups were significantly more likely than other incoming students to have other DSM-IV symptoms. Parental care was negatively associated and parental overprotection/control positively associated with these psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, significant interactions were found of parenting style with both threshold and sub-threshold ADHD in predicting wide-ranging comorbid symptoms. Specifically, the associations of ADHD with some externalizing symptoms were inversely related to level of paternal care, while associations of ADHD and sub-threshold ADHD with wide-ranging comorbid symptoms were positively related to level of maternal and paternal overprotection/control. These results suggest that parenting styles may modify the effects of ADHD on the risk of a wide range of temporally secondary DSM-IV symptoms among incoming college students, although other causal dynamics might be at work that need to be investigated in longitudinal studies.

1369,Participants' appraisals of process issues and the effects of stress management interventions,"It has been argued that traditional quasi-experimental approaches to evaluation do not adequately measure, or take account of, perceptual processes that could contribute to the effectiveness of organizational-level interventions. Using longitudinal data with added process measures at time 2 gathered from I I intervention projects in Denmark, this paper used structural equation modelling (n = 462) to explore the impact of employees' direct appraisals of the intervention itself on intervention outcomes. Perceived influence on the content of interventions was directly linked to voluntary participation in these interventions. Participants' appraisals of the activities within an intervention were found to fully mediate the relationships between exposure to interventions and outcome measures (changes in working conditions, behavioural stress and job satisfaction). The results of the study indicate that employees' appraisal of the intervention itself can play an important role in determining the success or failure of a variety of organizational-level interventions.

1371,Life-style intervention at the worksite - reduction of cardiovascular risk factors in a randomized study,"Objectives This study tested a feasible method for screening for cardiovascular risk at the worksite and investigated the effects of a long-term comprehensive program of life style intervention to prevent cardiovascular disease.Methods Employees in the public sector filled out a self-administered questionnaire with questions on social, medical, and work-related factors. The respondents numbered 454 (80%). A score sum for cardiovascular risk was calculated (range 1-20, median 7.0), and the 128 subjects with a sum above 8 were invited to a health examination including blood sampling. Thereafter the subjects were invited to participate, following randomization, in a comprehensive, 18-month, life-style intervention program to improve cardiovascular risk or in a control group.Results The intervention group significantly decreased body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and smoking habits during the intervention. The initially elevated serum cortisol, as a marker of stress reaction, normalized in the intervention group. In the control group LDL cholesterol also decreased, but the glucose and triglyceride levels increased, and smoking habits were unchanged. Sick days for a given period decreased after 1 year in the intervention group but not in the control group.Conclusions Several cardiovascular risk factors can be improved and morning serum cortisol normalized during a long-term life-style intervention program with a randomized design using a worksite population of middle-aged subjects. The use of a 2-step screening program, with an initial questionnaire followed by a health check of subjects with elevated risk, is feasible for worksite settings.","Nilsson, PM; Klasson, EB; Nyberg, P",0,10.5271/sjweh.587,1054
1372,"Pedagogical work, stress regulation and work-related well-being among early childhood professionals in integrated special day-care groups","The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between early childhood professionalsâ€™ (ECPs) stress regulation (using salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase [AA] measurements), work engagement and the quality of their pedagogical work in integrated special day-care groups. Participants were 89 ECPs from 21 integrated special day-care groups located in Helsinki, Finland. The special educational needs of children (who were between 3 and 6Â years of age) in these groups varied from language disorders and self-regulation difficulties to severe disabilities. Data was collected by using work engagement surveys, salivary cortisol and AA measurements and observational assessments of pedagogical work. This study is novel, in that it combines approaches from different disciplines to investigate work-related well-being among ECPs. Our findings demonstrate the close relationship between ECPsâ€™ stress regulation and the quality of pedagogical work in teams. Whilst ECPsâ€™ high work engagement was associated with better-quality pedagogical work, we did not find any associations between different biomarkers and work engagement. Our study highlights the importance of teamwork, not only as fundamental to high-quality early childhood special education, but also in supporting the well-being of ECE professionals. The findings can be applied in future studies and can be used to inform intervention aiming to enhance working conditions in day-care centres.

1373,Suicide Among Soldiers: A Review of Psychosocial Risk and Protective Factors,"Suicide is difficult to predict and prevent and remains a leading cause of death worldwide. Although soldiers historically have had a suicide rate well below that of the general population, the suicide rate among members of the U.S. Army has increased markedly over the past several years and now exceeds that of the general population. This paper reviews psychosocial factors known to be associated with the increased risk of suicidal behavior in general and describes how some of these factors may be especially important in understanding suicide among soldiers. Moving forward, the prevention of suicide requires additional research aimed at: (a) better describing when, where, and among whom suicidal behavior occurs, (b) using exploratory studies to discover new risk and protective factors, (c) developing new methods of predicting suicidal behavior that synthesize information about modifiable risk and protective factors from multiple domains, and (d) understanding the mechanisms and pathways through which suicidal behavior develops. Although the scope and severity of this problem is daunting, the increasing attention and dedication to this issue by the Armed Forces, scientists, and society provide hope for our ability to better predict and prevent these tragic outcomes in the future.","Nock, Matthew K.; Deming, Charlene A.; Fullerton, Carol S.; Gilman, Stephen E.; Goldenberg, Matthew; Kessler, Ronald C.; Mc Carroll, James E.; McLaughlin, Katie A.; Peterson, Christopher; Schoenbaum, Michael; Stanley, Barbara; Ursano, Robert J.",0,10.1521/psyc.2013.76.2.97,1056
1375,Protocol: a multi-level intervention program to reduce stress in 9-1-1 telecommunicators.,"BACKGROUND: Nationwide, emergency response systems depend on 9-1-1 telecommunicators to prioritize, triage, and dispatch assistance to those in distress. 9-1-1 call center telecommunicators (TCs) are challenged by acute and chronic workplace stressors: tense interactions with citizen callers in crisis; overtime; shift-work; ever-changing technologies; and negative work culture, including co-worker conflict. This workforce is also subject to routine exposures to secondary traumatization while handling calls involving emergency situations and while making time urgent, high stake decisions over the phone. Our study aims to test the effectiveness of a multi-part intervention to reduce stress in 9-1-1 TCs through an online mindfulness training and a toolkit containing workplace stressor reduction resources.METHODS/DESIGN: The study employs a randomized controlled trial design with three data collection points. The multi-part intervention includes an individual-level online mindfulness training and a call center-level organizational stress reduction toolkit. 160 TCs will be recruited from 9-1-1 call centers, complete a baseline survey at enrollment, and are randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group. Intervention group participants will start a 7-week online mindfulness training developed in-house and tailored to 9-1-1 TCs and their call center environment; control participants will be ""waitlisted"" and start the training after the study period ends. Following the intervention group's completion of the mindfulness training, all participants complete a second survey. Next, the online toolkit with call-center wide stress reduction resources is made available to managers of all participating call centers. After 3months, a third survey will be completed by all participants. The primary outcome is 9-1-1 TCs' self-reported symptoms of stress at three time points as measured by the C-SOSI (Calgary Symptoms of Stress Inventory). Secondary outcomes will include: perceptions of social work environment (measured by metrics of social support and network conflict); mindfulness; and perceptions of social work environment and mindfulness as mediators of stress reduction.DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an online mindfulness training and call center-wide stress reduction toolkit in reducing self-reported stress in 9-1-1 TCs.

1376,An evaluation of a stress management program for individuals with schizophrenia,"Vulnerability-stress models suggest that training in specific stress management techniques should yield benefits to those suffering from schizophrenia and related disorders. In this paper, we describe an evaluation of the impact of adding a stress management program to other medical and psychosocial interventions for such patients. Outcomes were compared for 121 patients randomly assigned to receive either a 12-week stress management program with follow-up sessions or participation in a social activities group. The two treatment conditions did not differ in levels of symptoms, perceived stress or life skills immediately after completion of treatment or at 1-year follow-up. Patients who received the stress management program did have fewer hospital admissions in the year following treatment. This effect of stress management was most apparent for those who showed high levels of attendance for treatment sessions. It was concluded that training in stress management may provide patients with skills for coping with acute stressors and reduce the likelihood of subsequent acute exacerbation of symptoms with need for hospitalization.

Findings from the Men Stress 40 + study,"Objective Despite the increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity associated with vital exhaustion (VE), the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. Allostatic load may constitute the missing link between VE and cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether men with different degrees of VE would differ in terms of allostatic load, chronic stress, and social support. Methods The Men Stress 40 + study sample consisted of N = 121 apparently healthy men aged 40 to 75 years. The following allostatic load markers were aggregated to create a cumulative index of biological stress: salivary cortisol, salivary dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), waist-to-hip-ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Long-term cortisol and DHEA were additionally measured in hair. Chronic stress and social support were assessed via validated questionnaires. Groups of mildly, substantially, and severely exhausted men were compared using one-way ANOVAs with appropriate post-hoc tests. Results Men who reported mild or severe levels of vital exhaustion had the highest scores on the cumulative index of biological stress. Hair cortisol was unrelated to vital exhaustion; hair DHEA was highest in men with substantial levels of exhaustion. Men with mild exhaustion reported the lowest levels of chronic stress, while men with severe exhaustion reported the lowest levels of social support. Conclusions Signs of allostatic load are detectable in vitally exhausted men at a stage where no major cardiovascular consequences have yet ensued.

1379,Continuous Traumatic Situations in the Face of Ongoing Political Violence: The Relationship Between CTS and PTSD,"This article presents a literature review of the concept of continuous traumatic situations (CTS), which relates to residents living in ongoing situations of political violence and national security threats. The first aim of this review is to narrow the gap regarding knowledge about the concept of CTS by presenting findings from studies that have assessed the effects of CTS on civilian populations. The second aim is to describe CTS in a way that highlights the differences and similarities between posttraumatic stress disorder and responses to CTS. This distinction is a necessary precondition for examining CTS, as is a careful clinical analysis of the development and course of symptoms. This literature review also highlights the importance of adopting a supplementary perspective for understanding the psychological impact of ongoing exposure to real threats, which can be used as a basis for developing intervention strategies that are appropriate for coping with life in the context of persistent violence. CTS can be manifested as emotions, behaviors, and perceptions among individuals, families, communities, and societies. The nature of the proposed model of CTS is a circular one, combining past and future perceptions and emotional reactions that have resulted from continuous and repeated traumatic experiences over an extended period of time. This wider understanding reflects the complexity of the CTS phenomenon. Various micro and macro interventions relating to CTS as the result of political violence situations and national security threats are presented, and recommendations for practice, policy, and future research are offered.

Suggestions for addressing medication adherence and accommodating interventions with concomitant substance use treatment are also considered. These recommendations are presented with an emphasis on expanding both the efficacy and effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in HIV. These recommendations are presented as realistic strategies for improving the modest treatment effect sizes for psychosocial outcomes and identifying meaningful effects on distal physiological outcomes associated with traditional stress management interventions in HIV.

1381,Use of the Tailored Activities Program to reduce neuropsychiatric behaviors in dementia: an Australian protocol for a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness,"Background:Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are often considered to be the greatest challenge in dementia care, leading to increased healthcare costs, caregiver burden, and placement into care facilities. With potential for pharmacological intervention to exacerbate behaviors or even lead to mortality, the development and rigorous testing of non-pharmacological interventions is vital. A pilot of the Tailored Activities Program (TAP) for reducing problem behaviors in people with dementia was conducted in the United States with promising results. This randomized trial will investigate the effectiveness of TAP for reducing the burden of BPSD on persons with dementia and family caregivers within an Australian population. This trial will also examine the cost-effectiveness and willingness to pay for TAP compared with a control group.Methods:This randomized trial aims to recruit 180 participant dyads of a person with dementia and their caregivers. Participants will have a diagnosis of dementia, exhibit behaviors as scored by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and the caregiver must have at least 7 h per week contact. Participants will be randomly allocated to intervention (TAP) or control (phone-based education sessions) groups, both provided by a trained occupational therapist. Primary outcome measure will be the revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Clinician rating scale (NPI-C) to measure BPSD exhibited by the person with dementia.Conclusions:This trial investigates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TAP within an Australian population. Results will address a significant gap in the current Australian community-support base for people living with dementia and their caregivers.","O'Connor, C. M.; Clemson, L.; Brodaty, H.; Jeon, Y.

There were 64 children with at least mild symptoms of grief and/or traumatic stress and their guardians who participated in this open trial. The TF-CBT for Child Traumatic Grief protocol was adapted for use with a group, resulting in 12 weekly sessions for children and guardians separately with conjoint activities and 3 individual visits with child and guardian. Using a task-sharing approach, the intervention was delivered by lay counselors with no prior mental health experience. Primary child outcomes assessed were symptoms of grief and posttraumatic stress (PTS); secondary outcomes included symptoms of depression and overall behavioral adjustment. All assessments were conducted pretreatment, posttreatment, and 3 and 12 months after the end of treatment. Results showed improved scores on all outcomes posttreatment, sustained at 3 and 12 months. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) for baseline to posttreatment were 1.36 for child reported grief symptoms, 1.87 for child-reported PTS, and 1.15 for guardian report of child PTS.

1385,Mental illness Self-Management: A randomised controlled trial of the wellness recovery action planning intervention for inpatients and outpatients with psychiatric illness,"Objective. Wellness Recovery Action Planning (WRAP) is a cross-diagnostic, patient-centred, self-management intervention for psychiatric illness. WRAP utilises an individualised Wellness Toolbox, a six part structured monitoring and response system, and a crisis and post-crisis plan to promote recovery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of WRAP on personal recovery, quality of life, and self-reported psychiatric symptoms. Method. A prospective randomised controlled trial, based on the CONSORT principles was conducted using a sample of 36 inpatients and outpatients with a diagnosis of a mental disorder. Participants were randomly allocated to Experimental Group or Waiting List Control Group conditions in a 1:1 ratio. Measures of personal recovery, personal recovery life areas, quality of life, anxiety, and depression were administered at three time points: (i) pre-intervention, (ii) post-Experimental Group intervention delivery, and (iii) 6-month follow-up. Data was analysed by available case analysis using univariate and bivariate methodologies. Results. WRAP had a significant effect on two personal recovery life areas measured by the Mental Health Recovery Star: (i) addictive behaviour and (ii) identity and self-esteem. WRAP did not have a significant effect on personal recovery (measured by the Mental Health Recovery Measure), quality of life, or psychiatric symptoms. Conclusions. Findings indicate that WRAP improves personal recovery in the areas of (i) addictive behaviour and (ii) identity and self-esteem. Further research is required to confirm WRAP efficacy in other outcome domains. Efforts to integrate WRAP into recovery-orientated mental health services should be encouraged and evaluated.

1387,Meta-analysis of psychosocial interventions on survival time in patients with cancer,"Objective: This study was to evaluate the effects of psychosocial interventions on survival in adult patients with cancer.Method: MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane Library CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Korean electronic databases (September 2014) were searched. Methodological quality was assessed using Cochrane's Risk of Bias for randomized studies. The RevMan 5.3 program of the Cochrane library was used for data analysis.Results: Fifteen randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 2940 participants. Overall, psychosocial interventions was not associated with better survival (HR=.83, 95% CI [.68, 1.10], p=.06, I-2=64%). In subgroup analysis, based on six trials with 1448 subjects, psychoeducational interventions for cancer patients with non-metastatic at intervention implementation resulted in a 41% reduction in the risk of dying of cancer (HR=.59, 95% CI [.49, .71], p<.001, I-2=0%). For psychoeducational intervention, significant survival benefit were found when health staff delivered the intervention and at a follow-up time of more than 10 years.Conclusions: Use of psychoeducational interventions for cancer patients at early stage appeared to have beneficial effects on survival, preferably for delivering of health staff. However, conduct of further psychosocial studies with adequate power will lead to better understanding of the effects of treatments on survival outcome.","Oh, P. J.; Shin, S. R.; Ahn, H. S.; Kim, H.

1388,Depressive symptoms are associated with lower bone mineral density in young adults with high job strain the cardiovascular risk in young finns study,"Background Job strain has been associated with depressive symptoms, and depression has been associated with low bone mineral density (BMD). Purpose The associations between BMD and job strain have not been studied. We examined the relations between BMD, job strain, and depressive symptoms in a population-based group of young adults in FIN. Method Ultrasonic measurement of BMD at the calcaneus was performed on 777 participants (men 45 %, aged 30-45) drawn from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. Job strain was assessed by self-Administered questionnaires by the combination of job demands and job control. Depressive symptoms were assessed with a modified Beck Depression Inventory. The effects of job strain on BMDwere studied with multivariable analyses with age, sex, BMI, vitamin D, and calcium intake, physical activity, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and depressive symptoms as covariates. Results Depressive symptoms were independently associated with lower BMD T score in participants with high job strain (Î²=-0.241, p=0.02), but depressive symptoms were not significantly associated withBMDin the low (Î²=-0.160, p=0.26) and intermediate (Î²=-0.042, p=0.66) job strain categories. Conclusion The results suggest that job strain modifies the association between depressive symptoms and BMD. Depressed individuals with high work-related stress might be in increased risk of lower bone mineral density.

This unprecedented disaster resulted in a large population of disaster workers in need of psychological assessment and sometimes treatment following their deployment to Ground Zero. Topics include an overview of what has now become the Weill Cornell Medical College Program for Anxiety and Traumatic Stress Studies and the clinical and logistical challenges involved in establishing a large-scale psychological screening and treatment program for disaster workers following the September 11th attacks. We will describe the rapid development and implementation of a well-validated, standardized psychological screening protocol of clinical interviews and self-report measures and the provision of best practices-based prolonged exposure and cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for disaster workers and civilians with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, we will discuss our development of a novel line of research investigating the use of virtual reality technology in the treatment of WTC-related PTSD. The rationale in embarking on this area of inquiry, the details of developing this program, and the clinical research outcomes of our work will be described. Finally, an overview of the potential range of mental health problems in non-rescue disaster workers consequent to the WTC attacks, as well as the larger public health implications of our findings, will be discussed.

1391,House calls revisited: leveraging technology to overcome obstacles to veteran psychiatric care and improve treatment outcomes,"Despite an increasing number of military service members in need of mental health treatment following deployment to Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous psychological and practical barriers limit access to care. Perceived stigma about admitting psychological difficulties as well as frequent long distances to treatment facilities reduce many veterans' willingness and ability to receive care. Telemedicine and virtual human technologies offer a unique potential to expand services to those in greatest need. Telemedicine-based treatment has been used to address multiple psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and substance use, as well as to provide suicide risk assessment and intervention. Clinician education and training has also been enhanced and expanded through the use of distance technologies, with trainees practicing clinical skills with virtual patients and supervisors connecting with clinicians via videoconferencing. The use of these innovative and creative vehicles offers a significant and as yet unfulfilled promise to expand delivery of high-quality psychological therapies, regardless of clinician and patient location.","Olden, Megan; Cukor, Judith; Rizzo, Albert 'Skip'; Rothbaum, Barbara; Difede, JoAnn",0,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05756.x,1068

The PAR program is a strengths-based resilience-building program that integrates interpersonal and cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) perspectives. Pre-, post- and follow-up measures on 20 PAR participants from a resource-sector company were compared with a non-intervention-matched comparison group. At follow-up, the PAR group had maintained significant post-test improvements in coping self-efficacy and lower levels of stress and depression, and reported greater work-life fit than the comparison group. The program appeared to be ecologically valid and treatment integrity was maintained. Process evaluations of PAR program showed that skills were rated highly and widely used in everyday life at both post and follow-up measurement times.","Millear P., Liossis P., Shochet I.M., Biggs H., Donald M.",1,10.1375/bech.25.4.215,1069

1394,Feasibility and effectiveness of a brief meditation-based stress management intervention for patients diagnosed with or at risk for coronary heart disease: A pilot study,"Extensive research has led to the development of a psychobiological model of cardiovascular disease. This model suggests that psychological factors such as depression, anxiety, hostility, and stress may affect the development and progression of coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent studies have also demonstrated that meditation-based stress reduction programs are useful interventions for patients with various medical and psychological symptoms. The objective of this pilot study was to gather preliminary information regarding the feasibility of implementing a brief meditation-based stress management (MBSM) program for patients with CHD, and those at high risk for CHD, at a major metropolitan hospital that serves a predominately non-local patient population. The secondary aim of this study was to investigate the possibility that such an intervention might reduce depression, as well as perceived stress, anxiety, and hostility, while improving general health scores. The overall feasibility results indicate that this MBSM intervention was highly feasible with regard to both recruitment and retention of participants. In fact, 40% of patients requested further training. In addition, after completion of the 4-week intervention, participants reported significant reductions in depression and perceived stress. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the brief meditation-based stress management program was well-received by patients and can successfully be used as a supportive program for patients at risk or diagnosed with CHD.","Olivo, EL; Dodson-Lavelle, B; Wren, A; Fang, YX; Oz, MC",0,10.1080/13548500902890087,1071

It aims to help individuals manage their own wellness regardless of geographical location. WOLP is based on a holistic approach to health and consists of six wellness dimensions: physical (exercise and diet), emotional, social, intellectual, spiritual and occupational. A total of 150 volunteers from the general public were recruited online for this study and data were collected at three intervals: at the beginning of the programme (week 1), mid-programme (week 3) and at the end of the programme (week 6). Ninety of the participants (60%) completed the six-week programme. Acceptance of WOLP, measured by the frequency of individual usage, increased from the start to the end of the programme. Overall personal wellness management improved after six weeks on the wellness programme (5-10%). The study shows that personal wellness management, which had been demonstrated in the narrower confines of the corporate sector, is also possible in the public domain.","Omar, A; Wahlqvist, ML; Kouris-Blazos, A; Vicziany, M",0,10.1258/1357633054461985,1073
1400,Can stress management at the workplace prevent depression? A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Stress, mental health and depression at the workplace have emerged as common and significant problems. The effectiveness of a stress-management program at the workplace was investigated. Methods: The effectiveness of a stress-management program was examined in workers at a highly stressful workplace using a randomized controlled trial. The 58 workers in the office were randomly assigned into a stress-management group (n = 28) and a control group (n = 30). The stress-management program included lectures on the perception of stress, measures to cope with it, stress-management recording sheets, and e-mail counseling. This program was based on the cognitive behavioral approach. The stress-management program was carried out for 3 months, and perceived work-related stress and psychological symptoms were evaluated using: General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-30, Center for Epidemiologic Study for Depression (CES-D), the Questionnaire of Work-Related Stress and the Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire. Twenty-one out of the 28 in the stress-management group and all in the control group were successfully followed up. Results: In the stress-management group, a significant improvement in the depressive symptoms was observed, compared with the control group in CES-D (p = 0.003 by two-tailed paired t-test, and p = 0.042 by repeated measure analysis of variance). In the multiple regression analysis, the effect of stress management on depressive symptoms at follow-up was significant (p = 0.041), controlling for potential confounding factors. However, the alleviation of perceived occupational stress was limited. Conclusions: A stress-management program based on the cognitive behavioral approach at the workplace may have potential for the prevention of depression. Copyright Â© 2006 S.

It is argued that PTSD can be conceptualized as a disorder that is developed and maintained in traumatized individuals as a result of excessive, ineffective attempts to control unwanted thoughts, feelings, and memories, especially those related to the traumatic event(s). As ACT is a therapeutic method designed specifically to reduce experiential avoidance, it may be a treatment that is particularly suited for individuals with PTSD. The application of ACT to PTSD is described, and a case example is used to demonstrate how this therapy can be successfully used with individuals presenting for life problems related to a traumatic event.

1404,Socioeconomic factors in coronary artery disease â€“ Results from the SPIRR-CAD study,"Low socio-economic status (SES) has been associated with an increased coronary risk in Western countries. All stress experiences are more pronounced in low SES patients with stress emanating from problems with family, job, or money. The SPIRR-CAD study offered an excellent opportunity to examine these risk factors in German speaking mildly and medium depressed patients. In the SPIRR CAD study, a German multi centre randomized clinical trial of 450 male and 120 female coronary patients, we examined the standard and psychosocial risk factor profiles in relation to SES, as assessed by educational level. All differences in risk factors between low and high SES were in the inverse direction. Of standard risk factors, only smoking was socially graded and more common in low SES. Of psychosocial factors and emotions, exhaustion showed the strongest and most consistent inverse social gradient, but also anger, anxiety and depression were socially graded. The findings suggest that in German patients, as in other national groups, social gradients in CHD risk are considerable. They can be ascribed to both psychosocial and to standard risk factors. In the present two years follow-up, the prospective significance of psychological and social risk factors was analyzed showing that emotional factors played an important role, in that low and high SES patients differed in the expected direction. However, the differences were not statistically significant and therefore firm conclusions from follow up were not possible.

1405,5As Team obesity intervention in primary care: development and evaluation of shared decision-making weight management tools,"Despite several clinical practice guidelines, there remains a considerable gap in prevention and management of obesity in primary care. To address the need for changing provider behaviour, a randomized controlled trial with convergent mixed method evaluation, the 5As Team (5AsT) study, was conducted. As part of the 5AsT intervention, the 5AsT tool kit was developed. This paper describes the development process and evaluation of these tools. Tools were co-developed by the multidisciplinary research team and the 5AsT, which included registered nurses/ nurse practitioners (n = 15), mental health workers (n = 7) and registered dieticians (n = 7), who were previously randomized to the 5AsT intervention group at a primary care network in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The 5AsT tool development occurred through a practice/implementation-oriented, need-based, iterative process during learning collaborative sessions of the 5AsT intervention. Feedback during tool development was received through field notes and final provider evaluation was carried out through anonymous questionnaires. Twelve tools were co-developed with 5AsT. All tools were evaluated as either 'most useful' or 'moderately useful' in primary care practice by the 5AsT. Four key findings during 5AsT tool development were the need for: tools that were adaptive, tools to facilitate interdisciplinary practice, tools to help patients understand realistic expectations for weight loss and shared decision-making tools for goal setting and relapse prevention. The 5AsT tools are primary care tools which extend the utility of the 5As of obesity management framework in clinical practice.","Osunlana, A. M.; Asselin, J.; Anderson, R.; Ogunleye, A.

PHLAME compares these two behavior change models (the team-based versus the one-on-one approaches) against a usual-care control group. As a group, fire fighters have a concentration of the same harmful behaviors and health risks commonly afflicting the US population. Fire fighters have a unique work structure which is ideal for a team-centered model of behavior change. This strategy, based on Social Learning Theory, focuses on a team of fire fighters who work together on the same shift. If this team-centered model proves successful, it could provide a cost-effective method to impact behavior, and be disseminated among fire bureaus and in other team settings. The one-on-one intervention incorporates the Transtheoretical Model of behavior change, uses Motivational Interviewing for its counseling strategy and could be used in the more typical provider-client clinic setting. Findings from PHLAME will provide information about the process and outcomes of these models' ability to achieve health behavior change.","Moe, EL; Elliot, DL; Goldberg, L; Kuehl, KS; Stevens, VJ; Breger, RKR; DeFrancesco, CL; Ernst, D; Duncan, T; Dulacki, K; Dolen, S",1,10.1093/her/17.5.586,1080
1407,An Overview of Employee Wellness Programs (EWPs) in Large US Cities: Does Geography Matter?,"Although Employee Wellness Programs (EWPs) have been around for decades, initiatives in government organizations typically lag behind initiatives developed in the private sector in both magnitude and diversity. While city managers may invest in EWPs with the intent of saving on health care costs and of enhancing employee productivity, internal characteristics and incentive structures as well as the organizational culture within each individual bureaucracy ultimately shape the nature and direction of EWP management. Drawing upon the logic of geographic individuality of administrative regions, the authors argue that organizations in different cities are likely to develop and incorporate wellness services that reflect unique regional settings. By assessing EWPs across the county, it is evident that the decision to implement certain wellness services within a city unit are based, in part, on geography rather than technical characteristics of the organization or wellness program. This means that geographical attributes can be translated into the provision of services. Pressure to establish a program likely comes from many arenas, and this assessment posits that geography plays an important role in program adoption alongside the service distribution argument of need and ability to pay.","Otenyo, EE; Smith, EA",0,10.1177/0091026016689668,1081
1408,Physiological concomitants of perseverative cognition: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Rumination about the past and worries about the future (perseverative cognition) are extremely common, although pervasive and distressing, dysfunctional cognitive processes. Perseverative cognition is not only implicated in psychological health, contributing to mood worsening and psychopathology but, due to its ability to elicit prolonged physiological activity, is also considered to play a role in somatic health. Although there is emerging evidence that such negative and persistent thoughts have consequences on the body, this association has not yet been quantified. The aim of this study was to meta-analyze available studies on the physiological concomitants of perseverative cognition in healthy subjects. Separate meta-analyses were performed on each examined physiological parameter. Sixty studies were eligible for the analyses. Associations emerged between perseverative cognition and higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) (g =.45) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (g =.51) in experimental studies, and higher heart rate (HR) (g =.28 and g =.20) and cortisol (g =.36 and g =.32), and lower heart rate variability (HRV) (g =.15 and g =.27) in experimental and correlational studies, respectively. Significant moderators were sex, ethnicity, type of induction used to elicit perseverative cognition, assessment of state versus trait perseverative cognition, focus on worry or rumination, duration of physiological assessment, and quality of the studies. With the exception of blood pressure, results were not influenced by publication bias. Results show that perseverative cognition affects cardiovascular, autonomic, and endocrine nervous system activity, suggesting a pathogenic pathway to long-term disease outcomes and clarifying the still unexplained relationship between chronic stress and health vulnerability.

Fasting blood samples were obtained at the beginning and 6 weeks after the intervention to quantify hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.Results: After 6 weeks of intervention, a significant improvement of GHQ was observed in the probiotic yogurt (18.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 13.5 +/- 1.9, P = 0.007) and in the probiotic capsule group (16.9 +/- 1.8 vs. 9.8 +/- 1.9, P = 0.001), as well as a significant improvement in DASS scores in the probiotic yogurt (23.3 +/- 3.7 vs. 13.0 +/- 3.7, P = 0.02) and the probiotic capsule group (18.9 +/- 3.2 vs. 9.4 +/- 4.0, P = 0.006). However, there was no significant improvement in the conventional yogurt group (P = 0.05 for GHQ and P = 0.08 for DASS).Discussion: The consumption of probiotic yogurt or a multispecies probiotic capsule had beneficial effects on mental health parameters in petrochemical workers.","Mohammadi, Ali Akbar; Jazayeri, Shima; Khosravi-Darani, Kianoush; Solati, Zahra; Mohammadpour, Nakisa; Asemi, Zatollah; Adab, Zohre; Djalali, Mahmoud; Tehrani-Doost, Mehdi; Hosseini, Mostafa; Eghtesadi, Shahryar",1,10.1179/1476830515Y.0000000023,1083
1411,Clinical expertise: A preliminary attempt to clarify its core elements,"The recent emphasis on evidence-based practice revolves around an integration of three domains: client characteristics, relevant research, and clinical expertise. Unfortunately, most reports focus on the examination of current research, while few guidelines exist for clarifying or developing expertise in clinical psychology. Although expertise is more advanced than competence, basic clinical competence can set the foundation for the development of more sophisticated skills. It is best to strive for narrow domains of expertise instead of global ratings of a professional as an ""expert"". Five criteria are proposed for evaluating, developing, and maintaining clinical expertise: (1) the professional must possess a terminal degree in the field, (2) the professional has accumulated multiple years of clinical experience in the direct provision of clinical assessment, psychological testing, or psychological treatment, (3) the professional has attained advanced credentials in a specific area of psychology, (4) the professional is visible in the professional community at a national level, and (5) the professional has demonstrated evidence of superior clinical skills in a specific application of psychology. Together, these five criteria help to objectify the evaluation and cultivation of clinical expertise in psychology. Because each criterion is weak and flawed if used alone, it is recommended that multiple criteria are used in combination to define clinical expertise.

1412,"Contemporary perspectives on stress management: Medication, meditation or mitigation","Stressful life events can increase the risk for developing a variety of physical disorders and emotional problems. A biopsychosocial approach can help mental health professions to better understand and more effectively treat disorders that are related to severe negative life events. Biological approaches focus on suppressing emotional reactions, usually through a reliance on psychopharmacological interventions. Psychological approaches usually focus on the cognitive processes that translate stress into distress. Psychological interventions focus on changing the negative attitudes and maladaptive behaviors that aggravate most stressful situations. Social interventions focus on improving social support and involvement with agencies to confront limited finances, unemployment, and housing problems. In these times of economic crisis and severe financial hardship, psychological and social intervention strategies appear more useful than biological treatments.

1414,The Effect of Stress Management Training Program on Stress Coping Styles among the Adolescents in Prison in Turkey,"This study was performed to determine the effects of a stress management training program that was administered to adolescents in prison. This was a semi-experimental study that used pretests and posttests in controlled groups; it was performed between June 2012 and March 2013 in a closed prison for children and adolescents. The study was completed with the participation of 73 adolescents (36 in the experimental group and 37 in the control group). Adolescent Lifestyle Profile scale and the Stress Coping Styles Scale were used as the data collection tools. The Stress Management Training Program was developed by the researchers and carried out for 2weeks, a total of 10 sessions of 40min each. The scales were administered before the program was implemented, immediately after the program and 1month following the program. Although there were no statistically significant differences between the mean Stress Coping Styles Scale scores of the experimental and control groups before the intervention (p>0.05), a statistically significant difference was found after the intervention and at re-test (p<0.05). This study has shown that this training program could be implemented with adolescents in prison, and the program was effective in providing positive behavioural changes in stress management.

1416,Psychosocial factors and pregnancy outcome: A review with emphasis on methodological issues,"This review focuses on the research concerning the relation between psychosocial factors and pregnancy outcome. The following four outcome measures are dealt with: (1) birth weight, (2) preeclampsia, (3) preterm labour, and (4) intrapartum complications. The most consistent finding concerns the association between maternal exposure to taxing situations and preterm delivery. Three possible pathways are hypothesized: (1) an indirect influence via unhealthy coping and life style behaviour, (2) a direct influence via stress-dependent hormones, and (3) an additional direct influence via psycho-immunological factors. Intervention studies aimed at improving pregnancy outcome show fairly mixed results. It is recommended that studies on the relationship between psychosocial factors and pregnancy outcome should employ a prospective design with due attention to chronic stressors, should include appropriate biochemical assessments, and multivariate techniques are applied.

1417,Job rotation designed to prevent musculoskeletal disorders and control risk in manufacturing industries: A systematic review,"To better understand job rotation in the manufacturing industry, we completed a systematic review asking the following questions: 1) How do job-rotation programs impact work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and related risk control for these MSDs, as well as psychosocial factors? and 2) How best should the job rotation programs be designed? We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Business Source Premier, ISI Web of Knowledge, CINAHL, PsyINFO, Scopus, and SciELO databases for articles published in peer-reviewed journals. Eligible studies were examined by two independent reviewers for relevance (population of manufacturing workers, outcomes of musculoskeletal disorders, physical factors, psychosocial factors, and strategies used in job-rotation implantation) and methodological quality rating. From 10,809 potential articles, 71 were read for full text analysis. Of the 14 studies included for data extraction, two were non-randomized control trial studies, one was a case-control study, and 11 were cross-sectional comparisons. Only one, with a case-control design, was scored with good methodological quality. Currently, weak evidence exists supporting job rotation as a strategy for the prevention and control of musculoskeletal disorders. Job rotation did not appear to reduce the exposure of physical risk factors; yet, there are positive correlations between job rotation and higher job satisfaction. Worker training has been described as a crucial component of a successful job-rotation program. The studies reported a range of parameters used to implement and measure job-rotation programs. More rigorous studies are needed to better understand the full impact of job rotation on production and health. PROSPERO register: CRD42014013319. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1419,Psychosocial first Aid: Support for the child survivors of the Asian Tsunami,"We developed and implemented an assessment and intervention program that can be used as psychosocial first aid for children caught up in a humanitarian emergency. We developed training modules for professionals in this aspect of disaster relief. We based this in regional institutions, so that the program would have wide implementation across the country. Because this disaster was not anticipated, we were fortunate to have a group of previously trained individuals who were able to implement the knowledge and skills required to do workforce training. We would have liked to have used more rigorous program assessment activities, but there was no time to do so. More communities and countries need to do more disaster preparation that includes psychosocial first aid for children. It is important that multiple modalities of psychosocial assistance be used and available to strengthen families, to restore livelihoods, and to revitalize communities in the aftermath of a disaster. The use of the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale proved useful, and we recommend its development as a tool for testing the effectiveness of psychosocial first aid.","Pairojkul S., Siripul P., Prateepchaikul L., Kusol K., Puytrakul T.",0,10.1097/DBP.0b013e3181f46de2,1089
1421,Evidence that brief self-affirming implementation intentions can reduce work-related anxiety in downsize survivors,"Background and Objectives: Workers were recruited from a UK further education college during a period of organizational downsizing. This study assessed the effects of a brief health psychology intervention on work-related stress in downsize survivors. Design and Methods: Sixty-six employees were randomly allocated to one of two conditions: one in which they were asked to create a work-related self-affirming implementation intention (WS-AII) or a control. Feelings of anxiety and depression were measured before and after the intervention or control task and three weeks later. Job satisfaction, self-efficacy, and self-esteem were also measured. Results: There were statistically significant differences between the WS-AII condition and the control. Workers who created WS-AIIs reported an immediate reduction in anxiety. This reduction was also observed in their appraisal of job-related anxiety three weeks later. There were no significant effects of WS-AIIs on depression, job satisfaction, or self-esteem. There was, however, a significant effect on self-efficacy with workers in the WS-AII condition reporting greater self-efficacy. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that the integration of brief health psychology interventions, such as the WS-AII, into existing organizational practice may be of benefit to the well-being of employees.

1422,Staff burn-out prevention and stress management,"In many ways, adolescent seasonal camp staff are asked to do what no parent would likely be capable of doing: to be best friend, role model, and risk manager for a group of young strangers. The high expectations for camp responsibility converge at a time when the developmental stages of most camp staff and their growing skill sets may be most challenged. What we ask of seasonal staff may, in fact, be at direct odds with their developmental capabilities as adolescents. This conflict may be a primary source of daily hassle-type stress, which has been shown to have tremendous impact on health and general well-being. To help prevent or, at least, mitigate this impact, the combination of administrative structure, supervisory support, and peer and self-care is critical to staff development. This article provides a brief exploration of the developmental stages and capabilities of seasonal staff and, an overview of methods to support and empower staff while on the job to help prevent burnout and encourage stress management. The focus of this article is on mechanical and procedural prevention as a stress management tool.","Paisley, K; Powell, GM",0,10.1016/j.che.2007.05.013,1091

1424,On the management and prevention of heat stress for crews onboard ships,"From the thermo-hygrometrical perspective, some ship compartments are undoubtedly considered severe hot environments due to high temperature values, such as the engine room and, depending on external conditions, cargo holds and storage areas. Such peculiarity further increases already high stress levels related to awkward work postures, lack of space and appropriate lifting tools, noise, vibrations, and a poor air quality. Despite the extensive efforts made by National Governments and International Organizations to improve the quality and the safety of the work on board, over the last several years the thermo-hygrometric characterization of working conditions on board ship seems to have not been investigated enough. Particularly, little monitoring data are available and the use of obsolete or insufficiently validated heat stress indices is a common practice. Addressed to both trained and untrained specialists, this paper discusses how the ergonomic approach of the strategy SOBANE- successfully used for 15 years for risk management and prevention in industrial application- can be implemented onboard. Finally, based on the limited microclimatic data available in the literature, it will be shown which and how heat strain indices should be used for the analysis of heat stress on board.

1426,Study protocol: Evaluation of a parenting and stress management programme: A randomised controlled trial of Triple P Discussion Groups and Stress Control,"Background: Children displaying psychosocial problems are at an increased risk of negative developmental outcomes. Parenting practices are closely linked with child development and behaviour, and parenting programmes have been recommended in the treatment of child psychosocial problems. However, parental mental health also needs to be addressed when delivering parenting programmes as it is linked with parenting practices, child outcomes, and treatment outcomes of parenting programmes. This paper describes the protocol of a study examining the effects of a combined intervention of a parenting programme and a cognitive behavioural intervention for mental health problems. Methods/design. The effects of a combined intervention of Triple P Discussion Groups and Stress Control will be examined using a randomised controlled trial design. Parents with a child aged 3-8 years will be recruited to take part in the study. After obtaining informed consent and pre-intervention measures, participants will be randomly assigned to either an intervention or a waitlist condition. The two primary outcomes for this study are change in dysfunctional/ineffective parenting practices and change in symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Secondary outcomes are child behaviour problems, parenting experiences, parental self-efficacy, family relationships, and positive parental mental health. Demographic information, participant satisfaction with the intervention, and treatment fidelity data will also be collected. Data will be collected at pre-intervention, mid-intervention, post-intervention, and 3-month follow-up. Discussion. The aim of this paper is to describe the study protocol of a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effects of a combined intervention of Triple P Discussion Groups and Stress Control in comparison to a waitlist condition. This study is important because it will provide evidence about the effects of this combined intervention for parents with 3-8 year old children. The results of the study could be used to inform policy about parenting support and support for parents with mental health problems. Trial registration.

1429,Coping and resiliency enhancement program (CARE): a pilot study for interpreters in cancer care,"Objective: There is a growing demand for interpreters in the cancer setting. Interpreters, the link to quality care for limited English proficiency patients, face many psychosocial stressors in their work. This project assessed interpreters' experiences of stress and piloted a resiliency program to help interpreters cope with stressors. Methods: From 2013 to 2014, we pilot tested a targeted resiliency program with interpreters from three Boston-based hospitals. In Phase 1, we conducted five focus groups (n = 31) to identify interpreters' psychosocial needs. In Phase 2, we developed and tested a 4-h group program with 29 interpreters (response rate = 90%; 69% female, 54% Hispanic, 85% born outside of the U.S.). Results: Phase 1. Stressors were patient-based (seeing young patients decline), interactions with medical team (unsure of role), and systems-based (appointment unpredictability). Phase 2. At baseline interpreters reported low abilities to cope with stress (measured by the Measure of Current Status (MOCS-A)). At 4-week follow-up we found improvements in job satisfaction (p =.02; Cohen's d =.41) and declines in sick days (p =.08; Cohen's d =.38). Stress reactivity (MOCS-A) improved; specifically participants reported feeling more assertive about their needs (p =.10; Cohen's d =.30) and more able to relax at will (p =.10; Cohen's d =.35)â€”important mechanisms to lower distress. Conclusions: We piloted a resiliency program for medical interpreters in cancer care. We found that interpreters experience distress and have low coping skills. This program resulted in improved work factors and stress reactivity.

1431,The effects of a presurgical stress management intervention for men with prostate cancer undergoing radical prostatectomy,"Purpose: This study assessed the short-term and long-term efficacy of a presurgical stress management intervention at reducing mood disturbance and improving quality of life (QOL) in men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer. Patients and Methods: One hundred fifty-nine men were randomly assigned to a two-session (plus two boosters) presurgical stress management intervention (SM), a two-session (plus two boosters) supportive attention group (SA), or a standard care group (SC). Assessments occurred 1 month before surgery; 1 week before surgery; the morning of surgery; 6 weeks after surgery, and 6 and 12 months after surgery. Results: Results indicated significant group differences in mood disturbance before surgery (P = .02), such that men in the SM group had significantly less mood disturbance than men in the SC group (P = .006), with no significant differences between the SM and SA or SA and SC groups. In the year after surgery, there were significant group differences on Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form survey (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) scores (P = .004); men in the SM group had significantly higher PCS scores than men in the SC group (P = .0009), and there were no significant differences between the SM and SA or SA and SC groups. There were no group effects on prostate-specific QOL or SF-36 mental health scores. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the efficacy of a brief presurgical stress management intervention in improving some short-term and long-term outcomes. If these results are replicated, it may be a useful adjunct to standard care for men with prostate cancer undergoing surgery.

1432,Regulatory focus moderates the relationship between task control and physiological and psychological markers of stress: A work simulation study,"This experiment examined whether trait regulatory focus moderates the effects of task control on stress reactions during a demanding work simulation. Regulatory focus describes two ways in which individuals self-regulate toward desired goals: promotion and prevention. As highly promotion-focused individuals are oriented toward growth and challenge, it was expected that they would show better adaptation to demanding work under high task control. In contrast, as highly prevention-focused individuals are oriented toward safety and responsibility they were expected to show better adaptation under low task control. Participants (N= 110) completed a measure of trait regulatory focus and then three trials of a demanding inbox activity under either low, neutral, or high task control. Heart rate variability (HRV), affective reactions (anxiety & task dissatisfaction), and task performance were measured at each trial. As predicted, highly promotion-focused individuals found high (compared to neutral) task control stress-buffering for performance. Moreover, highly prevention-focused individuals found high (compared to low) task control stress-exacerbating for dissatisfaction. In addition, highly prevention-focused individuals found low task control stress-buffering for dissatisfaction, performance, and HRV. However, these effects of low task control for highly prevention-focused individuals depended on their promotion focus.

1433,Development of a Sleep Telementorship Program for Rural Department of Veterans Affairs Primary Care Providers: Sleep Veterans Affairs Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes,"Rationale: Primary care providers (PCPs) frequently encounter sleep complaints, especially in regions with limited specialty care access.Objectives: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (VA-ECHO) program (based on Project ECHO) has successfully provided rural PCP education in subspecialty areas, including hepatitis C. We describe the feasibility of an ECHO program for sleep medicine.Methods: ECHO creates a virtual learning community through video-teleconferencing, combining didactics with individualized clinical case review. We invited multidisciplinary providers to attend up to 10 stand-alone, 1-hour sessions. Invitees completed a needs assessment, which guided curriculum development. After program completion, we examined participant characteristics and self-reported changes in practice and comfort with managing sleep complaints. We surveyed participation barriers among invitees with low/no attendance.Measurements and Main Results: Of the 39 program participants, 38% worked in rural healthcare. Participants included nurse practitioners (26%), registered nurses (21%), and physicians (15%). Seventeen (44%) completed the summative program evaluation. Respondents anticipated practice change from the program, especially in patient education about sleep disorders (93% of respondents). Respondents reported improved comfort managing sleep complaints, especially sleep-disordered breathing, insomnia, and sleep in post-traumatic stress disorder (80% of respondents each). A follow-up survey of program invitees who attended zero to two sessions reported scheduling conflicts (62%) and lack of protected time (52%) as major participation barriers.Conclusions: Participants in a pilot sleep medicine VA-ECHO program report practice change and increased comfort managing common sleep complaints.

1434,CenteringPregnancy-Africa: A pilot of group antenatal care to address Millennium Development Goals,"Background: severe health worker shortages and resource limitations negatively affect quality of antenatal care (ANC) throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Group ANC, specifically CenteringPregnancy (CP), may offer an innovative approach to enable midwives to offer higher quality ANC.Objective: our overarching goal was to prepare to conduct a clinical trial of CenteringPregnancy-Africa (CP-Africa) in Malawi and Tanzania. In Phase 1, our goal was to determine the acceptability of CP as a model for ANC in both countries. In Phase 2, our objective was to develop CP-Africa session content consistent with the Essential Elements of CP model and with national standards in both Malawi and Tanzania. In Phase 3, our objective was to pilot CP-Africa in Malawi to determine whether sessions could be conducted with fidelity to the Centering process.Setting: Phases 1 and 2 took place in Malawi and Tanzania. Phase 3, the piloting of two sessions of CP-Africa, occurred at two sites in Malawi: a district hospital and a small clinic.Design: we used an Action Research approach to promote partnerships among university researchers, the Centering Healthcare Institute, health care administrators, health professionals and women attending ANC to develop CP-Africa session content and pilot this model of group ANC.Participants: for Phases 1 and 2, members of the Ministries of Health, health professionals and pregnant women in Malawi and Tanzania were introduced to and interviewed about CP. In Phase 2, we Finalised CP-Africa content and trained 13 health professionals in the Centering Healthcare model. In Phase 3, we conducted a small pilot with 24 pregnant women (12 at each site).Measurements and findings: participants enthusiastically embraced CP-Africa as an acceptable model of ANC health care delivery. The CP-Africa content met both CP and national standards. The pilot established that the CP model could be implemented with process fidelity to the 13 Essential Elements. Several implementation challenges and strategies to address these challenges were identified.Key conclusions: preliminary data suggest that CP-Africa is feasible in resource-constrained, low-literacy, high-HIV settings in sub-Saharan Africa. By improving the quality of ANC delivery, midwives have an opportunity to make a contribution towards Millennium Development Goals (MDG) targeting improvements in child, maternal and HIV-related health outcomes (MDGs 4, 5 and 6). A clinical trial is needed to establish efficacy.Implications for practice: CP-Africa also has the potential to reduce job-related stress and enhance job satisfaction for midwives in low income countries. If CP can be transferred with fidelity to process in sub-Saharan Africa and retain similar results to those reported in clinical trials, it has the potential to benefit pregnant women and their infants and could make a positive contribution to MGDs 4, 5 and 6.

1435,Heart rate variability during sleep following the practice of cyclic meditation and supine rest,"Day time activities are known to influence the sleep on the following night. Cyclic meditation (CM) has recurring cycles. Previously, the low frequency (LF) power and the ratio between low frequency and high frequency (LF/HF ratio) of the heart rate variability (HRV) decreased during and after CM but not after a comparable period of supine rest (SR). In the present study, on thirty male volunteers, CM was practiced twice in the day and after this the HRV was recorded (1) while awake and (2) during 6 h of sleep (based on EEG, EMG and EGG recordings). This was similarly recorded for the night's sleep following the day time practice of SR. Participants were randomly assigned to the two sessions and all of them practiced both CM and SR on different days. During the night following day time CM practice there were the following changes; a decrease in heart rate, LF power (n.u.), LF/HF ratio, and an increase in the number of pairs of Normal to Normal RR intervals differing by more than 50 ms divided by total number of all NN intervals (pNN50) (P < 0.05, in all cases, comparing sleep following CM compared with sleep following SR). No change was seen on the night following SR. Hence yoga practice during the day appears to shift sympatho-vagal balance in favor of parasympathetic dominance during sleep on the following night.

1437,Therapeutic education in coronary heart disease: Position paper from the Working Group of Exercise Rehabilitation and Sport (GERS) and the Therapeutic Education Commission of the French Society of Cardiology,"Cardiovascular mortality has decreased over the past 25 years, largely because of acute coronary syndrome care and preventive actions. Nevertheless, the rate of coronary heart disease remains high, with an annual risk of 4.7% (cardiac mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke). Cardiovascular risk factor management must be a priority in primary and secondary prevention, to improve the prognosis of this severe disease, in which absence of symptoms does not mean benignity. The current goals of therapeutic patient education are smoking cessation, regular physical activity, a cardioprotective (Mediterranean) diet, management of stress, good treatment adherence (which improves compliance), judicious use of the care system and help with occupational reintegration. Current and future programmes must be in accordance with the Haute Autorite de Sante recommendations published in 2007. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

1438,"The preparatory set: A novel approach to understanding stress, trauma, and the bodymind therapies","Basic to all motile life is a differential approach/avoid response to perceived features of environment. The stages of response are initial reflexive noticing and orienting to the stimulus, preparation, and execution of response. Preparation involves a coordination of many aspects of the organism: muscle tone, posture, breathing, autonomic functions, motivational/emotional state, attentional orientation, and expectations. The organism organizes itself in relation to the challenge. We propose to call this the â€œpreparatory setâ€ (PS). We suggest that the concept of the PS can offer a more nuanced and flexible perspective on the stress response than do current theories. We also hypothesize that the mechanisms of body-mind therapeutic and educational systems (BTES) can be understood through the PS framework. We suggest that the BTES, including meditative movement, meditation, somatic education, and the body-oriented psychotherapies, are approaches that use interventions on the PS to remedy stress and trauma. We discuss how the PS can be adaptive or maladaptive, how BTES interventions may restore adaptive PS, and how these concepts offer a broader and more flexible view of the phenomena of stress and trauma. We offer supportive evidence for our hypotheses, and suggest directions for future research. We believe that the PS framework will point to ways of improving the management of stress and trauma, and that it will suggest directions of research into the mechanisms of action of BTES.

1439,Traumatic stress disorders: A classification with implications for prevention and management,"The management and prevention of acute and post-traumatic stress disorders are current themes of great importance to the defense health services of many nations. Currently, between 2% and 8% of service members deployed on combat operations, United Nations peacekeeping tasks, and humanitarian and disaster relief operations present with one or more stress disorders within 3 years of deployment. The management of acute stress disorders and the prevention and management of post-traumatic stress disorders necessitate an understanding of the nosology of this group of illnesses. Research into some preventive options-such as critical incident stress debriefing-also necessitates the selection of syndrome-specific subjects during case finding if controversies about the efficacy of such interventions are to be resolved. Diagnostic features, a summary of the nosological evolution, and key points of differential treatment options are presented for 5 acute operational stress disorders (acute combat stress disorder, conversion reactions, the counter-disaster syndrome, peacekeeper's acute stress syndrome, and the Stockholm syndrome) and for 11 post-traumatic disorders, including classic post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic fatigue syndrome, Gulf War syndrome, peacekeeper's stress syndrome, survivor's guilt syndrome, and the syndrome of lifestyle and cultural change.",Pearn J.,0,,1107
1440,Forming a Stress Management and Health Promotion Program for Women Undergoing Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective. To assess the effects of an 8-week stress management and health promotion program on women undergoing breast cancer chemotherapy treatment. Patients and methods. A total of 61 patients were recruited in 2 cancer centers and were randomly assigned to the intervention program (n = 30) or control group (n = 31). The intervention program consisted of different stress management techniques, which were combined with instructions for lifestyle modification. Assessments were carried out through questionnaires and measurement of body mass index (BMI) at baseline and at the end of the 8-week program. Results. In all, 25 participants completed the intervention program, whereas 28 participants completed the observational control program. The intervention program resulted in a small effect size on internal dimension of Health Locus of Control (HLC) and a medium effect size on stress, depression, anxiety, night sleep duration, and chance dimension of HLC. A strong effect size was recorded for BMI and sleep onset latency. Self-rated health, spiritual well-being, and powerful others dimension of HLC were not significantly affected. Additionally, some of the participants reported a reduction in the side effects caused by chemotherapy. Conclusions. The intervention resulted in several benefits for the general health status of patients. Therefore, it should be considered as feasible and potentially beneficial for women undergoing breast cancer chemotherapy. However, it is necessary for this intervention to be tested through a randomized controlled trial in a larger sample of patients before adopting this program in standard cancer care.

1441,Longitudinal analysis of HIV risk behaviour patterns and their predictors among public primary care patients with tuberculosis in South Africa,"The goal of this study was to identify various HIV risk behaviours among tuberculosis (TB) patients in a longitudinal study design in South Africa. In 42 public primary healthcare facilities in three districts in three provinces, adult new TB and TB retreatment patients with hazardous or harmful alcohol use were interviewed within 1 month of initiation of anti-TB treatment and were followed up at 6 months. The total sample with a complete 6-month follow-up assessment was 853. At the follow-up assessment, several HIV risk behaviours significantly reduced from baseline to follow-up. In multivariate Generalized Estimating Equations logistic regression analyses, high poverty (odds ratio (OR): 2.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56-4.62), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.03-2.36), and sexual partner on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (OR=1.84, 95% CI=1.09-3.10) were associated with a higher odds, and excellent/very good perceived health status (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.37-0.98), severe psychological stress (OR=0.51, 95% CI=0.34-0.77), and HIV non-disclosure to most recent sexual partner (OR=0.40, 95% CI=0.25-0.65) were associated with a lower odds of inconsistent condom use. Being HIV positive (OR=4.18, 95% CI=2.68-6.53) and excellent/very subjective health status (OR=2.98, 95% CI=1.73-5.13) were associated with a higher odds, and having PTSD symptoms (OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.36-0.99), being on ART (OR=0.48, 95% CI=0.25-0.95), having a sexual partner on ART (OR=0.41, 95% CI=0.18-0.96), and HIV status non-disclosure (OR=0.25, 95% CI=0.15-0.41) were associated with a lower odds of having sex with an HIV-positive or HIV status unknown person. High poverty index (OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.19-3.25) and having a sexual partner on ART (OR=4.37, 95% CI=1.82-10.48) were associated with a higher odds, and having a partner with HIV-negative status (OR=0.29, 95% CI=0.16-0.51) and inconsistent condom use (OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.24-0.64) were associated with a lower odds of HIV status non-disclosure at last sex. The study found that among TB patients with problem drinking over a 6-month TB treatment period, the frequency of some HIV risk behaviours (inconsistent condom use) declined (OR=0.64, 95% CI=0.41-0.98), but also persisted at a high-level calling for a strengthening and integration of HIV prevention into TB management.","Peltzer, Karl",0,10.1080/17290376.2018.1433057,1109
1442,Cognitive behavioral stress management intervention improves quality of life in Spanish monolingual hispanic men treated for localized prostate cancer: Results of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: The efficacy of a group-based psychosocial intervention with ethnic minority health populations may depend on consideration for cultural factors that can interact with group processes. Purpose: The current study explored the efficacy of a 10-week group-based cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention that was linguistically and culturally adapted for use with Hispanic monolingual men recently treated for localized prostate carcinoma (PC). Methods: 71 Hispanic monolingual Spanish speakers were randomly assigned to a 10-week CBSM intervention or a half-day stress management seminar (control condition). Hierarchical regression was used to predict post-intervention QoL. Results: After controlling for relevant covariates, assignment to the CBSM condition significantly predicted greater physical well-being, emotional well-being, sexual functioning, and total well-being after the 10-week intervention period. Conclusions: Results suggest that participation in a culturally and linguistically adapted CBSM group intervention improved QoL in Hispanic monolingual men treated for localized PC.

1443,Behavioral management of recurrent headache: Three decades of experience and empiricism,"In the past three decades, behavioral interventions (chiefly relaxation, biofeedback, and stress-management) have become standard components of the armamentarium for management of migraine and tension-type headaches. Meta-analytic literature reviews of these behavioral interventions have consistently identified clinically significant reductions in recurrent headache. Across studies, behavioral interventions have yielded approximately 35-50% reduction in migraine and tension-type headache activity. Although we have only recently begun to directly compare standard drug and nondrug treatments for headache, the available evidence suggests that the level of headache improvement with behavioral interventions may rival those obtained with widely used pharmacologic therapies in representative patient samples. In recent years, some attempts have been made to increase the availability and cost effectiveness of behavioral interventions through alternative delivery formats and mass communications. Recent developments within diagnosis and classification are summarized, pointing out implications for behavioral researchers. Select future directions are discussed, which include impact of the triptans, cost and cost effectiveness, and integration of behavioral treatments into primary care settings, the place where the great majority of headache sufferers receive treatment.","Penzien D.B., Rains J.C., Andrasik F.",0,10.1023/A:1016247811416,1111
1445,Decreasing harsh discipline in mothers at risk for maltreatment: A randomized control trial,"This study tested the effectiveness of the attachment-based program Video-feedback Intervention to promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive Discipline (VIPP-SD; F. Juffer, M.J. Bakermans-Kranenburg, & M.H. van IJzendoorn, 2008) in decreasing harsh discipline of 43 mothers and their 1- to 4-year-old-children from severely deprived families. Based on previous studies, parenting stress was tested as a potential moderator of intervention effects on harsh discipline. Using a randomized control design, maternal harsh discipline was observed during home visits at the pretest and posttest, and mothers filled in questionnaires at both assessments. The VIPP-SD proved to be effective in decreasing maternal harsh discipline, but only for mothers who experienced higher levels of parenting stress at intake. These findings provide support for the program's ability to improve parenting in families who are most at risk for harsh parenting and for potentially maltreating child-parent interactions. The results are discussed in terms of the VIPP-SD elements most relevant to decreasing harsh discipline, and the challenges of parenting interventions in severely deprived populations.

1446,"Mechanical massage and mental training programmes affect employees' anxiety, stress susceptibility and detachment-a randomised explorative pilot study","Background: Working people's reduced ability to recover has been proposed as a key factor behind the increase in stress-related health problems. One not yet evidence-based preventive method designed to help employees keep healthy and be less stressed is an armchair with built-in mechanical massage and mental training programmes, This study aimed to evaluate possible effects on employees' experience of levels of ""Anxiety"", ""Stress Susceptibility"", ""Detachment"" and ""Social Desirability"" when using mechanical massage and mental training programmes, both separately and in combination, during working hours. Methods: Employees from four different workplaces were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: i) Massage and mental training (sitting in the armchair and receiving mechanical massage while listening to the mental training programmes, n=19), ii) Massage (sitting in the armchair and receiving mechanical massage only, n=19), iii) Mental training (sitting in the armchair and listening to the mental training programmes only, n=19), iv) Pause (sitting in the armchair but not receiving mechanical massage or listening to the mental training programmes, n=19), v) Control (not sitting in the armchair at all, n=17). In order to discover how the employees felt about their own health they were asked to respond to statements from the ""Swedish Scale of Personality"" (SSP), immediately before the randomisation, after four weeks and after eight weeks (end-of-study). Results: There were no significant differences between the five study groups for any of the traits studied (""Somatic Trait Anxiety"", ""Psychic Trait Anxiety"", ""Stress Susceptibility"", ""Detachment"" and ""Social Desirability"") at any of the occasions. However, the massage group showed a significant decrease in the subscale ""Somatic Trait Anxiety"" (p=0.032), during the entire study period. Significant decreases in the same subscale were also observed in the pause group between start and week eight (p=0.040) as well as between week four and week eight (p=0.049) and also in the control group between the second and third data collection (p=0.014). The massage and mental training group showed a significant decrease in ""Stress Susceptibility"" between week four and week eight (p=0.022). The pause group showed a significant increase in the subscale ""Detachment"" (p=0.044). Conclusions: There were no significant differences between the five study groups for any of the traits studied. However, when looking at each individual group separately, positive effects in their levels of ""Anxiety"", ""Stress Susceptibility"" and ""Detachment"" could be seen. Although the results from this pilot study indicate some positive effects, mechanical chair massage and mental training programmes used in order to increase employee's ability to recover, needs to be evaluated further as tools to increase the employees ability to recover.

1447,Promoting dietary change among state health employees in Arkansas through a worksite wellness program: The healthy employee lifestyle program (HELP),"Introduction Maintaining a healthy and productive workforce is essential for employers in public and private sectors. Poor nutrition and obesity contribute to chronic diseases and influence health care costs and productivity. Research indicates that eating a healthy diet is associated with lower body mass index and reduced risk for developing chronic disease. Methods The Arkansas Department of Health implemented the Healthy Employee Lifestyle Program to encourage wellness among state health employees. During the pilot year, participants completed a health risk assessment at baseline and again after 1 year that assessed diet and physical activity, other health risk factors, and readiness to make behavioral changes. Participants were encouraged to eat healthfully, participate in regular exercise, report health behaviors using a Web-based reporting system, accumulate points for healthy behaviors, and redeem points for incentives. Differences in participants' (n = 214) reported dietary behaviors between baseline and follow-up were assessed using Î§2 analyses and tests of symmetry. Results Consumption of sweets/desserts, fats, protein, grains, processed meats, and dairy did not differ significantly from baseline to follow-up. However, at follow-up more participants reported eating 3 or more fruits and vegetables per day than at baseline and being in the action and maintenance stages of readiness to change for eating 5 or more fruits and vegetables per day and for eating a diet low in fat. Conclusion Further study is needed to examine physical activity and other health risk factors to determine whether the program merits a broader dissemination.","Perez A.P., Phillips M.M., Cornell C.E., Mays G., Adams B.",0,,1114
1448,Promoting Positive Parenting in the Context of Homelessness,"Recent national reports suggest that nearly 1,000,000 families with children experience homelessness and that this number is rising (National Center on Family Homelessness, 2009; U.S. Conference of Mayors, 2010; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2011). Families experiencing homelessness are disproportionately more likely to have experienced economic, health, and social risk factors. These experiences can adversely influence the parent-child relationship. The purpose of this article is to (a) review the literature on the determinants and contextual issues of parenting in shelters; (b) describe specific programs that are focused on positive parenting in the context of homelessness; and (c) provide practice, research, and policy recommendations for supporting positive parenting among families living without homes.

1449,Improving the psychological status of children with asthma: A randomized controlled trial,"Children with asthma are at special risk for problems in psychological functioning, as are children with other chronic illnesses. We conducted a controlled trial of a combined education and stress management program among children ages 6 to 14 years with asthma. Eighty-one children were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group; 56 children completed data collection, 29 intervention and 27 control. Psychological status was assessed by the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) before and after the intervention, as were children's knowledge of asthma, stress (as measured by children's life events), and functional status (as indicated by such activities as school attendance, time playing with friends, and daily chore performance)., Children in the intervention group had a significant improvement in the total Behavior Problems score (p <.04) and Internalizing scale (p <.01) on the CBCL and a significant increase in daily chores (p <.04) compared with the control group. Before intervention, the two groups had statistically significant positive relationships between negative life events and behavior problem scores. After intervention, children in the control group still demonstrated a significant relationship between negative life events and total and Internalizing Behavior Problem scores, although participation in the intervention group negated that relationship. Children in the intervention group whose knowledge of asthma increased were more likely to report an increase in daily chores (p <.02)., We conclude that the intervention had a beneficial effect on psychological status and on children's daily activities. The effect may have occurred in part by decreasing the likelihood that perceived stress from negative life events led to poorer adjustment.

1450,Improving Managersâ€™ Psychophysical Well-Being: Effectiveness of Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia Biofeedback,"High work stress has been consistently associated with disturbed autonomic balance, specifically, lowered vagal cardiac control and increased sympathetic activity, which may lead to increased cardiovascular risk. Stress management procedures have been proposed to reduce autonomic dysfunctions related to work stress in different categories of workers exposed to heightened work demands, while a limited number of studies addressed this issue in managers. The present study was aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback (BF) intervention on psychological and physiological outcomes, in managers with high-level work responsibilities. Thirty-one managers leading outstanding private or public companies were randomly assigned to either a RSA-BF training (RSA-BF; NÂ =Â 16) or a control group (NÂ =Â 15). The RSA-BF training consisted of five weekly 45Â min sessions, designed to increase RSA, whereas controls had to provide a daily stress diary once a week. After the training, managers in both groups reported reduced heart rate at rest, lower anxiety levels and improvement in health-related quality of life. More importantly, managers in the RSA-BF group showed increased vagal control (as indexed by increased RSA), decreased sympathetic arousal (as indexed by reduced skin conductance and systolic blood pressure) and lower emotional interferences, compared to managers in the control group. Results from this study showed that RSA-BF training was effective in improving cardiac autonomic balance at rest. Moreover, findings from this study underline the effectiveness of biofeedback in reducing psychophysiological negative outcomes associated with stress in managers.

1451,Inner-city asthma - The role of the community,"Asthma morbidity and mortality are disproportionately high in low-income minority populations. Variations in environmental exposures, stress, and access to appropriate health care all contribute to these disparities. The complex nature of asthma with strong contributions from environmental, psychosocial, and biological factors suggest that community-based approaches focused on the unique needs of high-risk populations may be effective. The few previous randomized trials suggest that case management with professionals and/or community health educators may reduce asthma morbidity. Health-educator programs should be lodged in stable infrastructures with training and funding for community health workers to obtain long-term sustainability. Factors not amenable to individual intervention, however, such as poor condition of homes, outdoor pollution, and lack of access to appropriate care, will require collaborative efforts of community groups, academic professionals, public agencies, and health-care providers.","Persky, Victoria; Turyk, Mary; Piorkowski, Julie; Coover, Lenore; Knight, John; Wagner, Cynthia; Hernandez, Eva; Eldeirawi, Kamal; Fitzpatrick, Anne",0,10.1378/chest.07-1911,1118

1454,Perspectives on a home telehealth care management program for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder who smoke,"Background: Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have high rates of smoking and low quit rates. We conducted a qualitative evaluation of an integrated smoking cessation randomized controlled trial (RCT) that used home telehealth and motivational interviewing (MI) to change smoking behaviors among individuals with PTSD. Method: Using a convenience sample sourced from the original RCT, intervention and control group participants were invited to participate in a qualitative evaluation. Semistructured interview guides were used to assess the effectiveness of study components, make recommendations for future interventions, and identify facilitators/barriers to smoking cessation. We analyzed these data using an inductive and deductive, team-based content analysis approach. Results: We interviewed 32 study participants (intervention: n=15, control: n=17) who completed the original RCT within the previous 6 months. Respondents were highly satisfied with home telehealth and MI counseling. The intervention group respondents found MI counseling to be supportive, nonjudgmental, and informative. Control group respondents felt that they had received smoking cessation assistance. Respondents from both groups desired more information about PTSD and smoking, relied on smoking as a coping mechanism for PTSD, and believed that quitting was an individual choice. Conclusion: Respondents reported that home telehealth and MI were acceptable ways to provide smoking cessation assistance to individuals with PTSD. The support and increased awareness of smoking behaviors were perceived as helpful. Future investigations should focus on increasing support and information about stress management, smoking, PTSD, and the relationship between them for individuals with PTSD who smoke.

Its efficacy in improving motor skills was presented previously using a randomised controlled trial and a multivariate nested cohort design. Based on the Environmental Stress Hypothesis, it was argued that the program would also result in positive mental health outcomes, investigated in the current study. Pre-intervention scores were recorded for 511 children aged 4.83-6.17 years (M = 5.42, SD = .30). Intervention and control groups were compared 6 months following intervention, and again in their first school year. Changes in teacher-rated prosocial behaviour and total difficulties were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and data analysed using Generalised Linear Mixed Models. There was a significant improvement in prosocial behaviour of children in the intervention group six months after initial testing, which remained at 18-month follow-up. Total difficulties decreased at 6 months for the intervention group, with no change at 18 months. This effect was present only for the hyperactivity/inattention subscale. The only significant change for the control group was an increase in hyperactivity/inattention scores from pre-intervention to 18-month follow-up. The Animal Fun program appears to be effective in improving social and behavioural outcomes.

Dementia consists of loss of memory and other cognitive abilities, associated with social or occupational impairment. Potential neuroprotective effects of estrogen include lowering &beta;-amyloid, enhancing cholinergic function, promoting synaptic plasticity and nerve process growth, reducing oxidative stress, and enhancing brain glucose transport. Observational and longitudinal studies suggest that hormone therapy may attenuate age-associated cognitive impairment or decrease Alzheimer's disease but this has not been confirmed by randomized clinical trials.

These characteristics were examined by job type and a latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to group workers with similar characteristics.ResultsProduction workers had the highest prevalence of daily smoking (88% vs. 68% among managers), and addiction (61% vs. 26% among managers), and the highest mean level of perceived stress (6.4 vs. 4.9 among managers). The LCA identified three subgroups of smokers that differed in levels of barriers to cessation. Production workers were most likely to be in the group with greater barriers (P=0.01).ConclusionsThese results underscore the importance of targeting interventions to production workers and those who exhibit the greatest barriers to cessation.

1463,Cost-Effectiveness of a Community-Integrated Home-Based Depression Intervention in Older African Americans,"ObjectivesTo test the cost-effectiveness of a home-based depression program: Beat the Blues (BTB).DesignA cost-effectiveness analysis as part of a previously reported randomized controlled trial that compared BTB with a wait-list control group.SettingCommunity.ParticipantsEnglish-speaking, cognitively intact (Mini-Mental State Examination score 24), African Americans aged 55 and older with depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire score 5) (N=129).InterventionParticipants randomly assigned to BTB received up to 10 home visits over 4months from licensed social workers who provided care management, referral and linkage, stress reduction, depression education, and behavioral activation to help participants achieve self-identified goals.MeasurementsIncremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of BTB versus wait-list controls during the 4-month study period. The primary ICER was defined as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using the Euro Quality of Life 5D (EQ-5D) and secondarily using the Health Utilities Index-3 (HUI-3). Additional ICERs were calculated using clinical measures (cost per depression improvement, cost per depression remission). Costs included BTB intervention, depression-related healthcare visits and medications, caregiver time, and social services.ResultsBTB cost per participant per month was $146. Base case ICERs were $64,896 per QALY (EQ-5D) and $36,875 per QALY (HUI-3). Incremental cost was $2,906 per depression improvement and $3,507 per remission. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses yielded a cost/QALY range of $20,500 to $76,500.ConclusionBased on the range of cost-effectiveness values resulting from this study, BTB is a cost-effective treatment for managing depressive symptoms in older African Americans that compares favorably with the cost-effectiveness of previously tested approaches.","Pizzi, Laura T.; Jutkowitz, Eric; Frick, Kevin D.; Suh, Dong-Churl; Prioli, Katherine M.; Gitlin, Laura N.",0,10.1111/jgs.13146,1127
1464,Return to work: Police personnel and PTSD,"OBJECTIVE: This study i) describes the number of police personnel with PTSD who are working and those who are on sick leave before and after an out-patient-clinic treatment program and ii) examines which factors are related to return to work.PARTICIPANTS: Police personnel treated for PTSD (n = 121).METHODS: In this retrospective study all police officers had an intake interview before and an outtake interview following a 16-week treatment for PTSD. Information about several personal characteristics, PTSD complaints, and work related factors were gathered. A t-test and chi-square test were used to evaluate differences between working police personnel and police personnel on sick leave at intake and outtake. Binary logistic regression was used to test whether the intake data were related to returning to work at outtake.RESULTS: At the start of the treatment half of the police personnel were on sick leave (n = 59) and at outtake 48 participants who were not working at intake had returned to work. None of the variables at intake contributed significantly to return to work at outtake.CONCLUSION: The majority of police officers returned to work after the treatment program. We recommend that attention be paid to successful return to work as part of the treatment program, therefore the occupational health professional and employer should be involved.","Plat, Marie-Christine J.; Westerveld, Gre J.; Hutter, Renee C.; Olff, Miranda; Frings-Dresen, Monique H.

1465,"Bridging the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease with vascular pathology: The feed-back, the feed-forward, and oxidative stress","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is slowly but steadily undergoing a profound reshaping of the definition and approach caused by the frustrating gap between poorly controlled AD epidemiology and repeated lack of success in finding a cure. The frequently reported and currently accepted role of vascular pathology and vascular risk factors in AD pathophysiology in recent years is one major aspect of this need for a severe adjustment in the modus operandi in AD. A clue into the importance that the interdependence between AD and vascularity has gained in scientific opinion is the large amount of recent reviews, almost reaching that of original papers, on the topic. Far from aiming to meta-analyze all in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo experiments, animal model research, clinical investigations, and epidemiological surveys conducted so far on the vascular disease-AD axis, this work focus on selected aspects of it in the hope of identifying possible study designs to be applied to the vascular AD patient. Looking over the literature on AD-related vascular pathology, the need also emerges to find the right location of oxidative stress. Â© 2012 IOS Press and the authors.

1466,Empirically supported psychological treatments for adult acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder: A review,"Background: Acute stress disorder (ASD) predicts the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which in some sufferers can persist for years and lead to significant disability. We carried out a review of randomized controlled trials to give an update on which psychological treatments are empirically supported for these disorders, and used the criteria set out by Chambless and Hollon [1998: J Consult Clin Psychol 66:7-18] to draw conclusions about efficacy, first irrespective of trauma type and second with regard to particular populations. Methods: The PsycINFO and PubMed databases were searched electronically to identify suitable articles published up to the end of 2008. Fifty-seven studies satisfied our inclusion criteria. Results: Looking at the literature undifferentiated by trauma type, there was evidence that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) are efficacious and specific for PTSD, stress inoculation training, hypnotherapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, and psychodynamic therapy are possibly efficacious for PTSD and trauma-focused CBT is possibly efficacious for ASD. Not one of these treatments has been tested with the full range of trauma groups, though there is evidence that trauma-focused CBT is established in efficacy for assault- and road traffic accident-related PTSD. Conclusions: Trauma-focused CBT and to a lesser extent EMDR (due to fewer studies having been conducted and many having had amixed trauma sample) are the psychological treatments of choice for PTSD, but further research of these and other therapies with different populations is needed.

1467,Yoga and Physiotherapy: A Speculative Review and Conceptual Synthesis,"This article presents the potential integration of yoga and physiotherapy when considering the essence of their underlying concepts. Within the scope of this article the existence of several similarities between these two 'concepts' has been suggested. Researchers, physiotherapists and their patients as well as yoga practitioners can obtain valuable and additional arguments through the cross-fertilization of ideas across presented studies united by shared, underlying concepts. The practice of yoga is based on the following assumptions: complexity and multidimensionality, various positive influences on an individual's wholeness through the mind, body, and the relationships between them. These assumptions may have the potential to contribute towards the practice of physiotherapy and its underlying principles. The essence of physiotherapy as a multifaceted process requires teamwork and efforts of various specialists like psychologists, sociologists, occupational therapists and nurses if patients are to benefit. Ideally, the physiotherapist should possess knowledge from these areas of science in order to professionally care about patients. Therefore, it can be suggested that basic similarities exist between yoga and physiotherapy in terms of mutidisciplinarity and complexity of holistic care. Such conceptual enrichment may be a useful source of inspiration for physiotherapists concerned about their patients' overall health on a daily basis. The authors emphasize the usefulness of yoga practice in clinical units and explain how the essence of Ayurvedic knowledge might be extrapolated and incorporated into theoretical principles of physiotherapy process. The justification of the studies included is also presented.","Posadzki, Paul; Parekh, Sheetal",0,10.1007/s11655-009-0066-0,1131
1468,Effect of play activities on hospitalized children's stress: a randomized clinical trial,"Objective: The use of unstructured play as an intervention to help children cope with the stress of a hospitalization period was tested in this randomized clinical trial. Methods: Urinary cortisol (a stress marker) was examined in 53 pediatric patients hospitalized for respiratory diseases in a public hospital, divided into two groups that did or did not play. Results: Boys and girls from the play group, 7-11 years old, showed a decrease in cortisol levels after participating in play activities. In younger participants (4-7 years old) the intervention did not seem as efficient, probably because in this group maturity levels may have influenced how children cognitively engaged in play as a coping strategy. Conclusions: The study showed the importance of using interventions that consider age ranges and gender in enhancing coping strategies, as well as the importance of such techniques that are employed by occupational therapists since they are professionals with expertise in the use of activities as therapeutic instruments.","Potasz, Clarisse; Vilela De Varela, Maria Jose; De Carvalho, Luciane Coin; Do Prado, Lucila Fernandes; Do Prado, Gilmar Fernandes",0,10.3109/11038128.2012.729087,1132
1469,Understanding intentions and action in colorectal cancer screening,"Background: Factors involved in forming intentions to attend cancer screening may be different from those involved in translating intentions into action. Purpose: To test the hypotheses that social cognition variables predict intention better than action, and that life difficulty variables predict action better than intention, in colorectal screening. Methods: Participants from one center in the UK Flexible Sigmoidoscopy Trial (n = 2,969) were categorized according to their screening intention, measured at baseline, and their subsequent attendance at screening (recorded at the clinic). Differences in factors related to life difficulty (socioeconomic deprivation, health, stress, social support) and social cognition variables were examined, and discriminant analysis was used to identify sets of variables that best differentiated the groups. Results: Social cognition variables were strongly associated with intention but only weakly with action. In contrast, factors related to life difficulties (socioeconomic deprivation, poor health status) were better predictors of action than intention. Conclusion: Social cognition variables appeared to be important determinants of screening intentions. Other variables-that may be markers of barriers to implementing plans-were more strongly associated with action. To maximize colorectal screening participation, research is needed to identify a wider range of determinants of attendance.

1470,A meta-analytic review of prolonged exposure for posttraumatic stress disorder,"Two decades of research demonstrate the efficacy of exposure therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The efficacy of prolonged exposure (PE), a specific exposure therapy program for PTSD that has been disseminated throughout the world, has been established in many controlled studies using different trauma populations. However, a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of PE for PTSD has not been conducted to date. The purpose of the current paper is to estimate the overall efficacy of PE for PTSD relative to adequate controls. We included all published randomized controlled trials of PE vs. control (wait-list or psychological placebo) for the treatment of PTSD in adolescents or adults. Treatments were classified as PE if they included multiple sessions of imaginal and in vivo exposure and were based on the manualized treatment developed by Foa, Rothbaum, Riggs, and Murdock (1991). Thirteen studies with a total sample size of 675 participants met the final inclusion criteria. The primary analyses showed a large effect for PE versus control on both primary (Hedges's . g=. 1.08) and secondary (Hedges's . g=. 0.77) outcome measures. Analyses also revealed medium to large effect sizes for PE at follow-up, both for primary (Hedges's . g=. 0.68) and secondary (Hedges's . g=. 0.41) outcome measures. There was no significant difference between PE and other active treatments (CPT, EMDR, CT, and SIT). Effect sizes were not moderated by time since trauma, publication year, dose, study quality, or type of trauma. The average PE-treated patient fared better than 86% of patients in control conditions at post-treatment on PTSD measures. PE is a highly effective treatment for PTSD, resulting in substantial treatment gains that are maintained over time.

1472,An exploration and analysis on the timeliness of critical incident stress management interventions in healthcare,"There is debate in the literature regarding the definition and effectiveness of ""early"" critical incident stress management (CISM) interventions. Definitions range from interventions that take place within twelve hours (Everly and Mitchell, 1999; Stallard, Velleman, Salter & Howse, 2005) and up to a three month window (Bisson & Cohen, 2006). Others define early support as an intervention directly after an incident, before the individual leaves work and definitely before having their first sleep (Talbot, 1990; Snelgrove, 2000). Most CISM research is carried out in industries that do not have the same characteristics as healthcare namely, 24/7 operation and a strong female demographic. Therefore, given the lack of research evidence around the timeliness of CISM interventions in healthcare, this study examined the effect of early (<24 hours post-incident) vs. late (>24 hours post-incident) CISM interventions on stress reaction and employees perceptions of service. Although the subject population in each group was too small to show statistical significance, the quantitative data showed an overall trend that the early intervention group had lower mean scores for avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal at all three time periods. Thematic analysis demonstrated both groups found the CISM intervention was beneficial and the timing appropriate. Â© 2013 Chevron.","Priebe R., Thomas-Olson L.L.",0,,1135
1473,Can illness perceptions predict lower heart rate variability following acute myocardial infarction?,"Objective: Decreased heart rate variability (HRV) has been reported to be a predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). Patients' beliefs and perceptions concerning their illness may play a role in decreased HRV. This study investigated if illness perceptions predict HRV at 3 months following acute MI. Methods: 130 patients referred to a tertiary cardiology center, were examined within 48 h and 3 months following acute MI. At admission, patients' cognitive representations of their MI were assessed using the German version of the self-rated Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief IPQ). At admission and after 3 months (follow-up), frequency and time domain measures of HRV were obtained from 5-min electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings during stable supine resting. Results: Linear hierarchical regression showed that the Brief IPQ dimensions timeline (Î² coefficient = 0.29; p = 0.044), personal control (Î² = 0.47; p = 0.008) and illness understanding (Î² = 0.43; p = 0.014) were significant predictors of HRV, adjusted for age, gender, baseline HRV, diabetes, beta-blockers, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), attendance of cardiac rehabilitation, and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: As patients' negative perceptions of their illness are associated with lower HRV following acute MI, a brief illness perception questionnaire may help to identify patients who might benefit from a specific illness perceptions intervention.

1474,Multiple risk-behavior profiles of smokers with serious mental illness and motivation for change,"Objective: Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are dying on average 25 years prematurely. The leading causes are chronic preventable diseases. In the context of a tobacco-treatment trial, this exploratory study examined the behavioral risk profiles of adults with SMI to identify broader interventional needs. Method: Recruited from five acute inpatient psychiatry units, participants were 693 adult smokers (recruitment rate - 76%, 50% male, 45% Caucasian, age M = 39, 49% had income < $10,000) diagnosed with mood disorders (71%), substance-use disorders (63%), posttraumatic stress disorder (39%), psychotic disorders (25%), and attention deficit- hyperactivity disorder (25%). The Staging Health Risk Assessment, the primary measure used in this study, screened for risk status and readiness to change 11 health behaviors, referencing the period prior to acute hospitalization. Results: Participants averaged 5.2 (SD = 2.1) risk behaviors, including smoking (100%), high-fat diet (68%), inadequate fruits/vegetables (67%), poor sleep (53%), physical inactivity (52%), and marijuana use (46%). The percent prepared to change ranged from 23% for tobacco and marijuana to 76% for depression management. Latent class analysis differentiated three risk groups: the global higher risk group included patients elevated on all risk behaviors; the global lower risk group was low on all risks; and a mood and metabolic risk group, characterized by inactivity, unhealthy diet, sleep problems, and poor stress and depression management. The global higher risk group (11% of sample) was younger, largely male, and had the greatest number of risk behaviors and mental health diagnoses; had the most severe psychopathologies, addiction-treatment histories, and nicotine dependence; and the lowest confidence for quitting smoking and commitment to abstinence. Conclusion: Most smokers with SMI engaged in multiple risks. Expanding targets to treat co-occurring risks and personalizing treatment to individuals' multibehavioral profiles may increase intervention relevance, interest, and impact on health.

1475,Predictors of maternal psychological distress in rural India: A cross-sectional community-based study,"Background: Maternal common mental disorders are prevalent in low-resource settings and have far-reaching consequences for maternal and child health. We assessed the prevalence and predictors of psychological distress as a proxy for common mental disorders among mothers in rural Jharkhand and Orissa, eastern India, where over 40% of the population live below the poverty line and access to reproductive and mental health services is low. Method: We screened 5801 mothers around 6 weeks after delivery using the Kessler-10 item scale, and identified predictors of distress using multiple hierarchical logistic regression. Results: 11.5% (95% CI: 10.7-12.3) of mothers had symptoms of distress (K10 score > 15). High maternal age, low asset ownership, health problems in the antepartum, delivery or postpartum periods, caesarean section, an unwanted pregnancy for the mother, small perceived infant size and a stillbirth or neonatal death were all independently associated with an increased risk of distress. The loss of an infant or an unwanted pregnancy increased the risk of distress considerably (AORs: 7.06 95% CI: 5.51-9.04 and 1.49, 95% CI: 1.12-1.97, respectively). Limitations: We did not collect data on antepartum depression, domestic violence or a mother's past birth history, and were therefore unable to examine the importance of these factors as predictors of psychological distress. Conclusions: Mothers living in underserved areas of India who experience infant loss, an unwanted pregnancy, health problems in the perinatal and postpartum periods and socio-economic disadvantage are at increased risk of distress and require access to reproductive healthcare with integrated mental health interventions.

Design: Prospective open pilot study of 51 women with infertility enrolled in a group MBI. Psychological variables and salivary cortisol levels were obtained pre-and post-intervention; a 12-month follow-up survey assessed MBI skill adherence. Participants completed practice logs throughout the intervention. Results: Participants attended an average of eight sessions (SD=2.0), and practiced mind-body techniques which elicited the relaxation response (RR) an average of 5.9 (SD=0.8) days/week and 20.1 (SD=9.9) min/day; 80% completed the post-treatment assessment. The intervention resulted in a significant increase in perceived social support and a decrease in depressive symptoms and perceived stress; however, there were no significant changes in cortisol levels. Sixty-eight percent of the participants completed the 12-month follow-up, with 51% reporting continuation of RR-eliciting practice. Conclusion: This group of women with infertility provided with an MBI showed decreased symptoms of depression and stress and increased perceived social support. The protocol was feasible and participants reported a high degree of adherence and maintenance to the skills taught during the intervention. The findings indicate the value of appropriate evaluation against a control group. Â© 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

1478,Meta-Analytic Evidence for Effects of Mindfulness Training on Dimensions of Self-Reported Dispositional Mindfulness,"Improvements in stable, or dispositional, mindfulness are often assumed to accrue from mindfulness training and to account for many of its beneficial effects. However, research examining these assumptions has produced mixed findings, and the relation between dispositional mindfulness and mindfulness training is actively debated. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mindfulness training published from 2003-2014 to investigate whether (a) different self-reported mindfulness scale dimensions change as a result of mindfulness training, (b) key aspects of study design (e.g., control condition type, population type, and intervention type) moderate training-related changes in dispositional mindfulness scale dimensions, and (c) changes in mindfulness scale dimensions are associated with beneficial changes in mental health outcomes. Scales from widely used dispositional mindfulness measures were combined into 5 categories for analysis: Attention, Description, Nonjudgment, Nonreactivity, and Observation. A total of 88 studies (n= 5,787) were included. Changes in scale dimensions of mindfulness from pre to post mindfulness training produced mean difference effect sizes ranging from small to moderate (g = 0.28-0.49). Consistent with the theorized role of improvements in mindfulness in training outcomes, changes in dispositional mindfulness scale dimensions were moderately correlated with beneficial intervention outcomes (r =.27-0.30), except for the Observation dimension (r =.16). Overall, moderation analyses revealed inconsistent results, and limitations of moderator analyses suggest important directions for future research. We discuss how the findings can inform the next generation of mindfulness assessment. Â© 2016.","Quaglia J.T., Braun S.E., Freeman S.P., McDaniel M.A., Brown K.W.",0,10.1037/pas0000268,1140
1479,Guideline on the management of psoriasis in South Africa,"Background. Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic, relapsing, immune-mediated, potentially devastating disease, influenced by genetic and environmental factors, that can cause substantial morbidity and psychological stress and have a profound negative impact on patient quality of life.Objective. These guidelines for the management of psoriasis have been developed in an attempt to improve the outcomes of treatment of this condition in South Africa. Psoriasis has a major impact on the quality of life of sufferers, and it is expected that these guidelines, if implemented, will play a role in achieving improved outcome.Scope. These guidelines were developed to address the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis, of differing degrees of severity and in patients of all ages, by all health care professionals involved with its management.Recommendations. All health care workers involved in the management of psoriasis should take note of these guidelines and try to implement them in clinical practice as far as possible. All treatment methods and procedures not substantiated by evidence from the literature should be discontinued and avoided to decrease the financial burden of psoriasis treatment.Validation. These guidelines were developed through general consensus by a group of 8 South African dermatologists (the 'Working Group') sanctioned by the Dermatological Society of South Africa (DSSA), by adaptation for the South African situation of the current guidelines used in the USA, the UK, Germany, Canada and Finland. Draft documents were made available for comment to the dermatological community as a whole via the official website of the DSSA, and the guidelines were presented and discussed at the annual congress of the DSSA in 2008. All input from these sources, where appropriate, were then incorporated into these guidelines.Guidelines sponsor. Schering-Plough initiated the project and sponsored the meetings of the working group and all costs generated by these meetings.Plans for guideline revision. The field of biologicals and cytokine modulators is in a rapid phase of development, and revision of the scope and content of these guidelines will be ongoing as longer-term data emerge.","Raboobee, N.; Aboobaker, J.; Jordaan, H.

1480,Cluster randomized trial of a parent-based intervention to support early development of children in a low-income country,"Background: Programmes that promote early psychological development of children in the developed world have been found to be beneficial. However, such programmes are rare in underprivileged parts of the developing world. We adapted one such parent-based programme (Learning Through Play) for a rural Pakistani population and aimed to study if: (1) it was acceptable to community health workers; (2) the programme led to an improvement, after a period of 6 months, in mothers' knowledge and attitudes about early infant development; (3) it led to a reduction in the levels of maternal mental distress in the post-natal period. Methods: Using a cluster randomized design with villages as unit of randomization, 163 mothers from 24 villages in a rural sub-district of Rawalpindi, Pakistan, received the 'Learning Through Play' programme, whereas 146 mothers from 24 villages acted as controls. Twenty-four community health workers were trained to carry out the programme. Assessments were conducted using a specially developed 15-item Infant Development Questionnaire and the 20-item Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ). Results: Over 80% of the community health workers trained found the programme to be relevant and were able to integrate it into their routine work. There was a significant increase in mothers' knowledge and positive attitudes about infant development in the intervention group, compared with the control group. Women in the intervention group answered correctly 4.3 (95% CI 3.7-14.9, P < 0.001) more questions than the control group. There was no difference in levels of mental distress measured by the SRQ. Conclusions: The 'Learning Through Play' programme was successfully integrated into the existing health system and accepted by community health workers. The programme succeeded in improving the knowledge and attitudes of mothers about infant development.

1481,Listen protect connect for traumatized schoolchildren: A pilot study of psychological first aid,"Background: Listen Protect Connect (LPC), a school-based program of Psychological First Aid delivered by non-mental health professionals, is intended to support trauma-exposed children. Our objective was to implement LPC in a school setting and assess the effectiveness of LPC on improving psychosocial outcomes associated with trauma. Methods: A pilot quasi-experiment was conducted with middle school children self-identified or referred to the school nurse as potentially exposed to stressful life experiences. LPC was provided to students by the school nurse, and questionnaires were administered at baseline, 2-, 4- and 8-weeks to assess life stressors, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, social support, and school connectedness. A total of 71 measurements were collected from 20 children in all. Although a small sample size, multiple measurements allowed for multivariable mixed effects models to analyze changes in the repeated outcomes over time. Results: Students who received the intervention had reduced depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms from baseline throughout follow-up period. Total social support also increased significantly from baseline through 8-weeks, and school connectedness increased up to 4-weeks post-intervention. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of LPC as a school-based intervention of Psychological First Aid. Future randomized trials of LPC are needed, however.

To review the evidence on the prognostic value of psychosocial factors on transition from acute to chronic non-specific LBP in the adult general population. Systematic review is the design of the study. A systematic search was undertaken for prospective studies dealing with psychosocial risk factors for poor outcome of LBP in primary care, screening PuBmed, PsychInfo and Cochrane Library databases. The methodological quality of studies was assessed independently by two reviewers using standardized criteria before analysing their main results.Results. Twenty-three papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria, covering 18 different cohorts. Sixteen psychosocial factors were analysed in three domains: social and socio-occupational, psychological and cognitive and behavioural. Depression, psychological distress, passive coping strategies and fear-avoidance beliefs were sometimes found to be independently linked with poor outcome, whereas most social and socio-occupational factors were not. The predictive ability of a patient's self-perceived general health at baseline was difficult to interpret because of biomedical confounding factors. The initial patient's or care provider's perceived risk of persistence of LBP was the factor that was most consistently linked with actual outcome.Conclusion. Few independent psychosocial risk factors have been demonstrated to exist. Randomized clinical trials aimed at modifying these factors have shown little impact on patient prognosis. Qualitative research might be valuable to explore further the field of LBP and to define new management strategies.","Ramond, Aline; Bouton, Celine; Richard, Isabelle; Roquelaure, Yves; Baufreton, Christophe; Legrand, Erick; Huez, Jean-Francois",0,10.1093/fampra/cmq072,1144
1483,"A rehabilitation intervention to promote physical recovery following intensive care: a detailed description of construct development, rationale and content together with proposed taxonomy to capture processes in a randomised controlled trial","Background: Increasing numbers of patients are surviving critical illness, but survival may be associated with a constellation of physical and psychological sequelae that can cause ongoing disability and reduced health-related quality of life. Limited evidence currently exists to guide the optimum structure, timing, and content of rehabilitation programmes. There is a need to both develop and evaluate interventions to support and expedite recovery during the post-ICU discharge period. This paper describes the construct development for a complex rehabilitation intervention intended to promote physical recovery following critical illness. The intervention is currently being evaluated in a randomised trial (ISRCTN09412438; funder Chief Scientists Office, Scotland).Methods: The intervention was developed using the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing complex healthcare interventions. We ensured representation from a wide variety of stakeholders including content experts from multiple specialties, methodologists, and patient representation. The intervention construct was initially based on literature review, local observational and audit work, qualitative studies with ICU survivors, and brainstorming activities. Iterative refinement was aided by the publication of a National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline (No. 83), publicly available patient stories (Healthtalkonline), a stakeholder event in collaboration with the James Lind Alliance, and local piloting. Modelling and further work involved a feasibility trial and development of a novel generic rehabilitation assistant (GRA) role. Several rounds of external peer review during successive funding applications also contributed to development.Results: The final construct for the complex intervention involved a dedicated GRA trained to pre-defined competencies across multiple rehabilitation domains (physiotherapy, dietetics, occupational therapy, and speech/language therapy), with specific training in post-critical illness issues. The intervention was from ICU discharge to 3 months post-discharge, including inpatient and post-hospital discharge elements. Clear strategies to provide information to patients/families were included. A detailed taxonomy was developed to define and describe the processes undertaken, and capture them during the trial. The detailed process measure description, together with a range of patient, health service, and economic outcomes were successfully mapped on to the modified CONSORT recommendations for reporting non-pharmacologic trial interventions.Conclusions: The MRC complex intervention framework was an effective guide to developing a novel post-ICU rehabilitation intervention. Combining a clearly defined new healthcare role with a detailed taxonomy of process and activity enabled the intervention to be clearly described for the purpose of trial delivery and reporting. These data will be useful when interpreting the results of the randomised trial, will increase internal and external trial validity, and help others implement the intervention if the intervention proves clinically and cost effective.","Ramsay, Pam; Salisbury, Lisa G.; Merriweather, Judith L.; Huby, Guro; Rattray, Janice E.; Hull, Alastair M.; Brett, Stephen J.; Mackenzie, Simon J.; Murray, Gordon D.; Forbes, John F.; Walsh, Timothy Simon",0,10.1186/1745-6215-15-38,1145
1484,Motivational Interviewing as an Adjunct to Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Anxiety Disorders: A Critical Review of the Literature,"Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is efficaciously and effectively used in the treatment of anxiety disorders; however, as CBT for anxiety routinely utilizes exposure components, clients often experience ambivalence about treatment and their clinicians often must deal with resistance. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a therapeutic strategy that addresses ambivalence about change in clinical interventions. MI has been applied as an adjunct for treatments such as CBT in order to increase motivation for and commitment to the intervention, especially when components of the treatment may be challenging (e.g., exposure, cognitive restructuring). Though researchers have commented specifically on the use of MI as a supplement to CBT for anxiety disorders, no comprehensive review has systematically assessed the strengths and limitations of extant literature on the topic, nor across anxiety disorders. Findings are summarized from 6 case studies and uncontrolled trials and 11 randomized controlled trials published through March 2016. An integrated critique of this literature also is offered. Limitations and the preliminary nature of the work in this area notwithstanding, it appears that it is feasible to supplement or integrate CBT with MI and that doing so has the potential to improve treatment initiation and engagement, as well as clinical outcomes. A number of directions for future research are addressed, such as determining which MI approaches to implement, with whom, when, and in what contexts.

1486,Stress in fathers of moderately and late preterm infants: A randomised controlled trial,"The atypical behaviour of preterm infants can elicit stress in fathers and influence their ability to perceive and interpret infants' cues. This study investigated whether fathers of moderately and late preterm infants were more stressed than fathers of term infants. In a randomised controlled trial, we also studied the effect of the Mother-Infant Transaction Program on fathers stress at six and 12 months by using the Parenting Stress Index. Infants with gestational age â‰¥ 30.0 and â‰¤ 36 weeks were randomised to a preterm intervention group (n = 32) or a preterm control group (n = 37). A term reference group (n = 39) was also recruited. Fathers of preterm infants reported higher total stress than fathers of term infants at six (p =.002) and 12 months (p =.03). No significant differences were found in stress between preterm intervention and preterm control group. The intervention failed to reduce paternal stress, and the results may indicate that fathers require different intervention strategies.

1488,The impact of group-based exposure therapy on the PTSD and depression of 30 combat veterans,"Thirty combat veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) completed group-based exposure therapy (GBET) in three cohorts of 10 within a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care system (VA) outpatient program. GBET cohorts met twice a week, 3 hr per day, for 16 weeks. Participants made two within-group combat-related presentations and were asked to listen to recordings of these at least 10 times. The PTSD Checklist (PCL) and Beck Depression Inventory 2 (BDI-2) were administered at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 7-11-month follow-up. PTSD symptoms were significantly lower on both posttreatment assessments with a large effect size (d =.89). Moderate effects were found on depressive symptoms (d =.70) at follow-up. At follow-up, 73% of participants endorsed reliable reductions on either the PCL (<7), the BDI-2 (<8), or both. Moreover, 36% no longer met the criteria for PTSD on the PCL (â‰¤50) at follow-up. There was relatively high compliance with participants reporting completion of almost all assignments. A higher ""dose"" of reported listening to recordings of war-related presentations seems to reduce PCLs at follow-up.

1489,The Impact of the Alexander Technique on Improving Posture and Surgical Ergonomics During Minimally Invasive Surgery: Pilot Study,"Purpose: One of the main ergonomic challenges during surgical procedures is surgeon posture. There have been reports of a high number of work related injuries in laparoscopic surgeons. The Alexander technique is a process of psychophysical reeducation of the body to improve postural balance and coordination, permitting movement with minimal strain and maximum ease. We evaluated the efficacy of the Alexander technique in improving posture and surgical ergonomics during minimally invasive surgery.Materials and Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study in which subjects served as their own controls. Informed consent was obtained. Before Alexander technique instruction/intervention subjects underwent assessment of postural coordination and basic laparoscopic skills. All subjects were educated about the Alexander technique and underwent post-instruction/intervention assessment of posture and laparoscopic skills. Subjective and objective data obtained before and after instruction/intervention were tabulated and analyzed for statistical significance.Results: All 7 subjects completed the study. Subjects showed improved ergonomics and improved ability to complete FLS (TM) as well as subjective improvement in overall posture.Conclusions: The Alexander technique training program resulted in a significant improvement in posture. Improved surgical ergonomics, endurance and posture decrease surgical fatigue and the incidence of repetitive stress injuries to laparoscopic surgeons. Further studies of the influence of the Alexander technique on surgical posture, minimally invasive surgery ergonomics and open surgical techniques are warranted to explore and validate the benefits for surgeons.","Reddy, Pramod P.; Reddy, Trisha P.; Roig-Francoli, Jennifer; Cone, Lois; Sivan, Bezalel; DeFoor, W.

However descriptions and evaluations of intervention programs are infrequent. This article describes a student-led stress management program for 1st-year medical students and summarizes program evaluation data from 1,111 participants. Description: The Stress Management Program is a voluntary activity that involves small groups of 1st-year medical students meeting with 2nd-year student coleaders. At the beginning of the fall semester each group meets 1 hr per week for 7 consecutive weeks. Two psychologist faculty members serve as program coordinators. Evaluation: Mean annual participation rate for 1st-year students was 94% over 16 years. Program evaluation results are strongly positive. Conclusions: Based on longevity, participation, and student feedback, the program has been successful. Recommendations for creating and maintaining similar programs are offered.","Redwood, SK; Pollak, MH",0,10.1207/s15328015tlm1901_8,1150
1492,Work Stress Interventions in Hospital Care: Effectiveness of the DISCovery Method,"Effective interventions to prevent work stress and to improve health, well-being, and performance of employees are of the utmost importance. This quasi-experimental intervention study presents a specific method for diagnosis of psychosocial risk factors at work and subsequent development and implementation of tailored work stress interventions, the so-called DISCovery method. This method aims at improving employee health, well-being, and performance by optimizing the balance between job demands, job resources, and recovery from work. The aim of the study is to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of the DISCovery method in hospital care. Specifically, we used a three-wave longitudinal, quasi-experimental multiple-case study approach with intervention and comparison groups in health care work. Positive changes were found for members of the intervention groups, relative to members of the corresponding comparison groups, with respect to targeted work-related characteristics and targeted health, well-being, and performance outcomes. Overall, results lend support for the effectiveness of the DISCovery method in hospital care.","Niks, I; de Jonge, J; Gevers, J; Houtman, I",1,10.3390/ijerph15020332,1151
1493,Interventions to reduce stress in university students: A review and meta-analysis,"Background: Recent research has revealed concerning rates of anxiety and depression among university students. Nevertheless, only a small percentage of these students receive treatment from university health services. Universities are thus challenged with instituting preventative programs that address student stress and reduce resultant anxiety and depression. Method: A systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing stress in university students. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the assignment of study participants to experimental or control groups was by random allocation or parallel cohort design. Results: Retrieved studies represented a variety of intervention approaches with students in a broad range of programs and disciplines. Twenty-four studies, involving 1431 students were included in the meta-analysis. Cognitive, behavioral and mindfulness interventions were associated with decreased symptoms of anxiety. Secondary outcomes included lower levels of depression and cortisol. Limitations: Included studies were limited to those published in peer reviewed journals. These studies over-represent interventions with female students in Western countries. Studies on some types of interventions such as psycho-educational and arts based interventions did not have sufficient data for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Conclusion: This review provides evidence that cognitive, behavioral, and mindfulness interventions are effective in reducing stress in university students. Universities are encouraged to make such programs widely available to students. In addition however, future work should focus on developing stress reduction programs that attract male students and address their needs.

1494,Post-trauma support in the workplace: the current status and practice of critical incident stress management (CISM) and psychological debriefing (PD) within organizations in the UK,"Employers' duties of care under both common and statute law include the need to take reasonable care of the health and safety of the workforce. This includes both the moral and legal duties to consider the psychological needs of personnel following exposure to traumatic events related to the workplace. While this has been recognized within many high-risk occupations such the police, fire and rescue services and the military, there is also evidence that post-trauma support in the workplace is increasingly commonly provided not only among health and social services agencies, but within many private sector organizations. Over the past decade, however, there has been considerable controversy over the provision of early psychological support to personnel in the form of critical incident stress management ( CISM) processes. In particular, one aspect of CISM, the use of psychological debriefing ( PD) has come under scrutiny and criticism as two studies indicated that PD was ineffective and had the potential to do harm. Inevitably, this has provoked much uncertainty and confusion among some organizations as what should be the most appropriate support. It has also led to misconceptions and misunderstandings as to the aims and purpose of PD, together with inaccuracies of terminology, for example describing PD as 'counselling'. Despite the controversy, both CISM and PD continue to be provided on a widespread basis, often utilizing a framework of voluntary peer group support. This paper intends to ( i) present a review of the current status of CISM practices, including the use of PD within various organizations in the UK and ( ii) provide a clear framework and understanding of the main issues and to clarify conceptual misunderstandings. The history, principles and background of the use of post-trauma support in the workplace, charting trends over the past two decades, previous research, problems with the evidence base and current thinking and practice in the field are reviewed. The relevance and implications of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence Guidelines on the Assessment and Management of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which make recommendations for early interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder are discussed. Reference is made to the use of CISM and PD within both statutory and voluntary organizations in an international context.","Regel, Stephen",0,10.1093/occmed/kqm071,1153
1495,"Effects of an education program for stress reduction on supervisor knowledge, attitudes, and behavior in the workplace: A randomized controlled trial","Supervisors at work play a large role in stress management at the workplace. Providing supervisors with necessary information and useful skills might be one effective approach that will lead to stress reduction. However, very few studies have investigated the effect of supervisor education by using a rigorous study design. In a randomized controlled trial, we tried to clarify how an education program for stress reduction influences supervisor knowledge, attitudes, and behavior concerning stress management. The subjects were 46 supervisors of an old, established sake brewery manufacturer of 301 employees. The supervisors were assigned to either the intervention group (24 supervisors) or the control group (22 supervisors). We conducted a single-session education program that included the guidelines for worker mental health promotion to the intervention group. The education program was composed of a basic education lecture and active listening training. The effects of this program on supervisor knowledge, attitudes, and behavior were measured using an original, self-administered questionnaire. The intervention effect was tested by examining an interaction effect between groups and time (before education, three and six months after education). The education favorably affected supervisor knowledge (F=7.92; p=.001). As for behavior, the intervention effect was marginally statistically significant (F=2.51; p=.088). For the attitude score, however, there were no beneficial effects. In conclusion, the provision of necessary information and useful skills to supervisors seems to improve supervisor knowledge and behavior regarding stress management at the workplace for at least six months.","Nishiuchi, Kyoko; Tsutsumi, Akizumi; Takao, Soshi; Mineyama, Sachiko; Kawakami, Norito",1,10.1539/joh.49.190,1154
1496,What really matters to bipolar patients' caregivers: Sources of family burden,"Background: Identifying and modifying burdensome aspects might reduce the level of burden and their negative effects both on caregivers and patients' outcome. Most studies evaluate acutely ill patients, whereas the most relevant problems may be related to subthreshold symptoms and long-term outcome. The aims of the present study were to assess caregiver's subjective burden, to analyse which were the most burdensome aspects for caregivers and to study which variables could explain the caregiver's subjective burden. Methods: Caregivers of 86 euthymic bipolar patients completed the subjective burden subscale from an adapted version of the Social Behaviour Assessment Schedule. Results: Caregivers showed a moderate level of subjective burden. The highest levels of distress were reported regarding the patient's behaviour; the most distressing behaviours were hyperactivity, irritability, sadness and withdrawal. Regarding the patient's role performance, the most worrying aspects were those associated with the patient's work or study and social relationships. Regarding adverse effects on others, caregivers were especially distressed by the way the illness had affected their emotional health and their life in general. Poorer social and occupational functioning, an episode in the last 2 years, history of rapid cycling and the caregiver being responsible for medication intake explained a quarter of the variance of the caregiver's subjective burden. Limitations: This was a cross-sectional study focused only on primary caregivers, there was no control group of non-bipolar patients. Conclusions: This study provides relevant data concerning the burden of caregivers of stable bipolar patients, pointing at potential targets for psychosocial interventions. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V.

1497,Comparative cost-effectiveness of two interventions to promote work functioning by targeting mental health complaints among nurses: Pragmatic cluster randomised trial,"Background: The specific job demands of working in a hospital may place nurses at elevated risk for developing distress, anxiety and depression. Screening followed by referral to early interventions may reduce the incidence of these health problems and promote work functioning.Objective: To evaluate the comparative cost-effectiveness of two strategies to promote work functioning among nurses by reducing symptoms of mental health complaints. Three conditions were compared: the control condition consisted of online screening for mental health problems without feedback about the screening results. The occupational physician condition consisted of screening, feedback and referral to the occupational physician for screen-positive nurses. The third condition included screening, feedback, and referral to e-mental health.Design: The study was designed as an economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial with randomisation at hospital-ward level.Setting and participants: The study included 617 nurses in one academic medical centre in the Netherlands.Methods: Treatment response was defined as an improvement on the Nurses Work Functioning Questionnaire of at least 40% between baseline and follow-up. Total per-participant costs encompassed intervention costs, direct medical and non-medical costs, and indirect costs stemming from lost productivity due to absenteeism and presenteeism. All costs were indexed for the year 2011.Results: At 6 months follow-up, significant improvement in work functioning occurred in 20%, 24% and 16% of the participating nurses in the control condition, the occupational physician condition and the e-mental health condition, respectively. In these conditions the total average annualised costs were (sic)1752, (sic)1266 and (sic)1375 per nurse. The median incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the occupational physician condition versus the control condition was dominant, suggesting, cost savings of (sic)5049 per treatment responder. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the e-mental health condition versus the control condition was estimated at (sic)4054 (added costs) per treatment responder. Sensitivity analyses attested to the robustness of these findings.Conclusions: The occupational physician condition resulted in greater treatment responses for less costs relative to the control condition and can therefore be recommended. The e-mental health condition produced less treatment response than the control condition and cannot be recommended as an intervention to improve work functioning among nurses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

1499,"Distressed, Immobilized, or Lacking Employer Support? A Sub-classification of Acute Work-Related Low Back Pain","Introduction One possibility for reducing the disabling effects of low back pain (LBP) is to identify subgroups of patients who might benefit from different disability prevention strategies. The aim of this study was to test the ability to discern meaningful patient clusters for early intervention based on self-reported concerns and expectations at the time of an initial medical evaluation. Methods Workers seeking an initial evaluation for acute, work-related LBP (N = 496; 58 % male) completed self-report measures comprising of 11 possible risk factors for chronicity of pain and disability. Outcomes of pain, function, and return-to-work were assessed at 3-month follow-up. A K-means cluster analysis was used to derive patient subgroups based on risk factor patterns, and then these subgroups were compared with respect to 3-month outcomes. Results Eight of the 11 measures showed significant associations with functional recovery and return-to-work, and these were entered into the cluster analysis. A 4-cluster solution met criteria for cluster separation and interpretability, and the four clusters were labeled: (a) minimal risk (29 %), (b) workplace concerns (26 %); (c) activity limitations (27 %); and (d) emotional distress (19 %). Functional outcomes were best in the minimal risk group, poorest in the emotional distress group, and intermediate in the other two groups. A global severity index at baseline also showed highest overall risk in the emotional distressed group. Conclusions Patterns of early disability risk factors from this study suggest patients have differential needs with respect to overcoming emotional distress, resuming normal activity, and obtaining workplace support. Classifying patients in this manner may improve the cost-benefit of early intervention strategies to prevent long-term sickness absence and disability due to LBP.","Reme, Silje Endresen; Shaw, William S.; Steenstra, Ivan A.; Woiszwillo, Mary Jane; Pransky, Glenn; Linton, Steven J.",0,10.1007/s10926-012-9370-4,1158

Semi-structured interviews (n = 31) and group discussions (n = 12) were conducted with a total of 169 respondents (parents, female pupils, teachers, health workers and religious leaders).Results: While participants had heard of cancer in general, most respondents had no knowledge of cervical cancer, HPV, or HPV vaccines. Only health workers had heard of cervical cancer but very few knew its cause or had any awareness about HPV vaccines. After participants were provided with information about cervical cancer and HPV vaccination, the majority stated that they would support HPV vaccination of their daughter to protect them against cervical cancer. Opt-out consent for vaccination was considered acceptable. Most preferred age-based vaccination, saying this would target more girls before sexual debut than class-based vaccination. Potential side effects and infertility concerns were raised by 5/14 of participating male teachers.Discussion: Reported acceptability of HPV vaccination amongst parents, teachers and other community members was high in this population. Respondents stressed the need to provide adequate information about the vaccine to parents, that also addresses side effects and infertility concerns. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

1501,Drug withdrawal-induced depression: Serotonergic and plasticity changes in animal models,"This review discusses recent research of mood disorders associated with the cessation of psychoactive substances, with an emphasis on preclinical studies that have been published in the last decade. Animal models exhibiting anhedonic and depressive-like behaviours associated with drug withdrawal have been used to study the neurobiology of mood disorders and have culminated in the identification of novel targets for the treatment of depressive-like symptoms. This review will introduce the behavioural as well as the neurochemical and plasticity changes in depressed patients and several animal models of depression. Following, we provide a more in-depth discussion of the role of serotonergic neurotransmission and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis regulation as well as the neurogenic changes occurring after chronic drug intake focusing on the withdrawal associated depression. Although we mainly focus on animal data, some relevant human studies are also discussed. Establishing the commonalities of depression and drug-seeking behaviour will allow us to elucidate the factors driving the high co-morbidity between mood disorders and drug dependence.

Half of the participants were first generation immigrants from Mexico (50%), followed by U.S. born with 16.7%. Remaining nationalities represented were Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, and Venezuela with 33.3% combined. The average duration of living in the U.S. was 11.1 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) at baseline was 36.59 kg/m2 (SD = 7.72). Based on the DSM-IV, 28% (n = 5) participants were diagnosed with binge-eating disorder, 33% (n = 6) with bulimia nervosa purging type and 39% (n = 7) with eating disorder not otherwise specified. Participants received up to three nutritional sessions; a bilingual dietitian conducted 97.8% of sessions in Spanish. In total, fifty nutritional sessions were included in the qualitative analysis. A three step qualitative analysis was conducted. First, a bilingual research team documented each topic discussed by patients and all interventions conducted by the dietitian. Second, all topics were classified into specific categories and the frequency was documented. Third, a consensus with the dietitian was performed to validate the categories identified by the research team. Six categories (describing eating patterns, emotional distress, Latino culture values, family conflicts associated with disturbed eating behaviors, lack of knowledge of healthy eating, and treatment progress) emerged from patients across all nutritional sessions. Considering the background of immigration and trauma (60%, n = 15) in this sample the appropriate steps of nutritional intervention appear to be: 1) elucidating the connection between food and emotional distress, 2) providing psychoeducation of healthy eating patterns using the plate method, and 3) developing a meal plan.

Subjects: Ninety school employees. Design: Case-control study. Three months after the intervention, the subjects were assigned to a daily practice group (case: n=43) and a nonconsecutive daily practice group (control: n=47) according to their daily practice level of the yoga therapy program. Interventions: The subjects participated in a stress management education program based on an integrated yoga therapy session. The program included psychological education and counseling about stress management and yoga theories, as well as the practices of asanas, pranayama, relaxation, and cognitive structure based on Indian philosophy. Outcome measures: Assessments were performed before and after the program using the Subjective Units of Distress for mind and body and the Two-Dimensional Mood Scale. The General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ28) was used to assess the mental health state before the intervention and at 3 months after the program. Results: The subjects showed significant increases in their levels of calmness, comfort, and cheerfulness (p<0.001) and significant decreases in cognitive mind and body stress (p<0.001) after participating in the integrated yoga program. A comparison of the total scores on the GHQ28 using a two-way analysis of variance showed significant differences between the two groups in terms of both interaction (p=0.047) and the main effect (p=0.026). Conclusions: The present results suggested that a single session of an integrated yoga program was effective for reducing stress and that the mental health of school employees was promoted by the daily practice of the yoga therapy program.

Methods: Several strategies were used to search for studies reported in articles published up to 2013. Results: Our initial search retrieved 117 publications, of which 8 met our criteria for review. Of the eight studies, one provided Class I evidence, five provided Class III evidence, and two provided Class IV evidence for the efficacy of stress-management interventions according to the evidence classification established by the American Academy of Neurology. Most studies showed positive changes in outcomes assessed; however, the range of methodological quality among the published studies made it difficult to draw conclusions. Conclusions: The promising findings for stress-management interventions highlight the need for future studies. Additional large, prospective, multicenter studies will help to define the role of stress-management interventions in the treatment and course of MS. Furthermore, including outcome measures based on biological and clinical markers of disease will prove useful in understanding potential underlying mechanisms.

The current study adapted two workplace substance abuse prevention programs and tested a conceptual model of workplace training effects on help seeking and alcohol consumption.Design. Questionnaires were collected 1 month before, 1 month after, and 6 months within a cluster randomized field experiment.Setting. Texas small businesses in construction, transportation, and service industries. Subjects. A total of 1510 employees from 45 businesses were randomly assigned to receive no training or one of the interventions.Intervention. The interventions were 4-hour on-the-job classroom trainings that encouraged healthy lifestyles and seeking professional help (e.g., from the Employee Assistance Program [EAR]). The Team Awareness Program focused on peer referral and team building. The Choices in Health Promotion Program delivered various health topics based on a needs assessment.Measures. Questionnaires measured help-seeking attitudes and behavior, frequency of drinking alcohol, and job-related incidents.Analysis. Mixed-model repeated-measures analyses of covariance were computed.Results. Relative to the control group, training was associated with significantly greater reductions in drinking frequency, willingness to seek help, and seeking help from the EAR After including help-seeking attitudes as a covariate, the correlation between training and help seeking becomes nonsignificant. Help-seeking behavior was not correlated with drinking frequency.Conclusion. Training improved help-seeking attitudes and behaviors and decreased alcohol risks. The reductions in drinking alcohol were directly correlated with training and independent from help seeking.","Reynolds, G. Shawn; Bennett, Joel B.",0,10.4278/ajhp.121212-QUAN-600,1164

Perceived work ability was assessed with questionnaires at 3, 8, 12, and 15 months. Sick leave information was obtained from the personnel administration. Follow-up attendance was 100% at 3 months but declined gradually to 90% by 15 months. Both the intervention and control subjects received a 30-minute feedback on their physical capacity from a physiotherapist and individual exercise prescription and counseling. The intervention subjects also participated in worksite exercise training guided by a physiotherapist. Sixty-minute sessions (N=26) were held once a week for 8 months. About 50% of the intervention group participated in at least two-thirds of the sessions.Results According to a dichotomized work ability index, at 12 months, workers with ""good"" or ""excellent"" work ability increased more in the intervention group than in the control group (11.0%, 95% CI 0.2-21.9), as did the health-related prognosis of work ability at 8 months (8.1%, 95% CI 0.5-16.3). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups as regards job satisfaction, work ability index (including series of questions on 7 items), or sick leaves.Conclusions Physical activity once a week at worksites improves the perceived work ability of women with physically demanding work only slightly. Perceived work ability and sick leaves cannot be affected very positively using single-component exercise intervention. Work ability promotion may need a more multiprofessional approach.","Nurminen, E; Malmivaara, A; Ilmarinen, J; Ylostalo, P; Mutanen, P; Ahonen, G; Aro, T",1,10.5271/sjweh.652,1165
1510,Cost and Outcome of BehaviouRal Activation (COBRA): a randomised controlled trial of behavioural activation versus cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression Introduction,"Background: Depression is a common, debilitating and costly disorder. The best-evidenced psychological therapy -cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) - is complex and costly. A simpler therapy, behavioural activation (BA), may be an effective alternative.Objectives: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BA compared with CBT for depressed adults at 12 and 18 months' follow-up, and to investigate the processes of treatments.Design: Randomised controlled, non-inferiority trial stratified by depression severity, antidepressant use and recruitment site, with embedded process evaluation; and randomisation by remote computer-generated allocation.Setting: Three community mental health services in England.Participants: Adults aged >= 18 years with major depressive disorder (MDD) recruited from primary care and psychological therapy services.Interventions: BA delivered by NHS junior mental health workers (MHWs); CBT by NHS psychological therapists.Outcomes: Primary: depression severity (as measured via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9) at 12 months. Secondary: MDD status; number of depression-free days; anxiety (as measured via the Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7); health-related quality of life (as measured via the Short Form questionnaire-36 items) at 6, 12 and 18 months; and PHQ-9 at 6 and 18 months, all collected by assessors blinded to treatment allocation. Non-inferiority margin was 1.9 PHQ-9 points. We undertook intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses. We explored cost-effectiveness by collecting direct treatment and other health-and social-care costs and calculating quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, three-level version, at 18 months.Results: We recruited 440 participants (BA, n = 221; CBT, n = 219); 175 (79%) BA and 189 (86%) CBT participants provided ITT data and 135 (61%) BA and 151 (69%) CBT participants provided PP data. At 12 months we found that BA was non-inferior to CBT {ITT: CBT 8.4 PHQ-9 points [standard deviation (SD) 7.5 PHQ-9 points], BA 8.4 PHQ-9 points (SD 7.0 PHQ-9 points), mean difference 0.1 PHQ-9 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.3 to 1.5 PHQ-9 points, p = 0.89; PP: CBT 7.9 PHQ-9 points (SD 7.3 PHQ-9 points), BA 7.8 PHQ-9 points (SD 6.5 PHQ-9 points), mean difference 0.0 PHQ-9 points, 95% CI -1.5 to 1.6 PHQ-9 points, p = 0.99}. We found no differences in secondary outcomes. We found a significant difference in mean intervention costs (BA, 975; pound CBT, 1235; pound p < 0.001), but no differences in non-intervention (hospital, community health, social care and medication costs) or total (non-intervention plus intervention) costs. Costs were lower and QALY outcomes better in the BA group, generating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -6865 pound. The probability of BA being cost-effective compared with CBT was almost 80% at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's preferred willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000-30,000 pound per QALY. There were no trial-related adverse events.Limitations: In this pragmatic trial many depressed participants in both groups were also taking antidepressant medication, although most had been doing so for a considerable time before entering the trial. Around one-third of participants chose not to complete a PP dose of treatment, a finding common in both psychotherapy trials and routine practice.Conclusions: We found that BA is as effective as CBT, more cost-effective and can be delivered by MHWs with no professional training in psychological therapies.Future work: Settings and countries with a paucity of professionally qualified psychological therapists, might choose to investigate the delivery of effective psychological therapy for depression without the need to develop an extensive and costly professional infrastructure.","Richards, David A.; Rhodes, Shelley; Ekers, David; McMillan, Dean; Taylor, Rod S.; Byford, Sarah; Barrett, Barbara; Finning, Katie; Ganguli, Poushali; Warren, Fiona; Farrand, Paul; Gilbody, Simon; Kuyken, Willem; O'Mahen, Heather; Watkins, Ed; Wright, Kim; Reed, Nigel; Fletcher, Emily; Hollon, Steven D.; Moore, Lucy; Backhouse, Amy; Farrow, Claire; Garry, Julie; Kemp, Deborah; Plummer, Faye; Warner, Faith; Woodhouse, Rebecca",0,10.3310/hta21460,1166
1511,Self-management interventions for chronic disease: a systematic scoping review,"Objective: To investigate the contributions of physiotherapy and occupational therapy to self-management interventions and the theoretical models used to support these interventions in chronic disease.Data sources: We conducted two literature searches to identify studies that evaluated self-management interventions involving physiotherapists and occupational therapists in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EMBASE, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), SPORTdiscus, and REHABDATA databases.Study selection: Four investigator pairs screened article title and abstract, then full text with inclusion criteria. Selected articles (n = 57) included adults who received a chronic disease self-management intervention, developed or delivered by a physiotherapist and/or an occupational therapist compared with a control group.Data extraction: Four pairs of investigators performed independent reviews of each article and data extraction included: (a) participant characteristics, (b) the self-management intervention, (c) the comparison intervention, (d) outcome measures, construct measured and results.Data synthesis: A total of 47 articles reported the involvement of physiotherapy in self-management compared with 10 occupational therapy articles. The type of chronic condition produced different yields: arthritis n = 21 articles; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic pain n = 9 articles each. The theoretical frameworks most frequently cited were social cognitive theory and self-efficacy theory. Physical activity was the predominant focus of the self-management interventions. Physiotherapy programmes included disease-specific education, fatigue, posture, and pain management, while occupational therapists concentrated on joint protection, fatigue, and stress management.Conclusions: Physiotherapists and occupational therapists make moderate contributions to self-management interventions. Most of these interventions are disease-specific and are most frequently based on the principles of behaviour change theories.","Richardson, Julie; Loyola-Sanchez, Adalberto; Sinclair, Susanne; Harris, Jocelyn; Letts, Lori; MacIntyre, Norma J.; Wilkins, Seanne; Burgos-Martinez, Gabriela; Wishart, Laurie; McBay, Cathy; Ginis, Kathleen Martin",0,10.1177/0269215514532478,1167
1512,Group versus individual stress management intervention in breast cancer patients for fatigue and emotional reactivity: A randomised intervention study,"Background. Fatigue and emotional reactivity are common among women suffering from breast cancer and might detrimentally affect these women's quality of life. This study evaluates if the stress management delivered either in a group or individual setting would improve fatigue and emotional reactivity among women with a newly diagnosed breast cancer.Material and methods. Participants (n = 304) who reported elevated levels of distress at three-month post-inclusion were randomised between stress management in a group (GSM) (n = 77) or individual (ISM) (n = 78) setting. Participation was declined by 149 women. Participants completed the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) and the Everyday Life Stress Scale (ELSS) at the time of inclusion, 3- and 12-month post-inclusion. Analyses were made according to intention to treat and per-protocol principles. Mann-Whitney tests were used to examine differences between the two intervention groups.Results. No significant differences were detected between the GSM and ISM groups on fatigue or emotional reactivity. In addition, there were no changes over time for these outcomes.Conclusions. There were no differences between the two intervention arms with reference to fatigue or emotional reactivity; however, a clinically interesting finding was the low number of women who were interested in participating in a psychosocial intervention. This finding may have clinical implications when psychosocial support is offered to women with a newly diagnosed breast cancer and also in the planning of future studies.

1513,A stepped care stress management intervention on cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms among breast cancer patients - A randomized study in group vs. individual setting,"Objective To evaluate the mode of delivery of a stress management intervention, in a group or individual setting, on self-reported cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms. A secondary aim was to evaluate a stepped care approach. Methods All study participants (n = 425), who were female, newly diagnosed with breast cancer and receiving standard oncological care were offered Step I of the stepped care approach, a stress management education (SME). Thereafter, they were screened for cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms, and, if present (n = 304), were invited to join Step II, a more intense intervention, derived from cognitive behavioral therapy, to which they were randomized to either a group (n = 77) or individual (n = 78) setting. To assess cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms, participants completed the Impact of Event Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at the time of inclusion, three-months post-inclusion and approximately 12-months post-inclusion. Results The SME did not significantly decrease any of the cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms. No statistically significant differences were found between the group and the individual setting interventions. However, only 54% of the participants attended the group setting compared to 91% for the individual setting. Conclusion The mode of delivery had no effect on the cancer-related traumatic stress symptoms; however, the individual setting was preferred. In future studies, a preference-based RCT design will be recommended for evaluating the different treatment effects.

1514,Initial evaluation of an Internet intervention to improve the sleep of cancer survivors with insomnia,"Objective: Insomnia is a common complaint among cancer survivors. Fortunately, cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to be an effective treatment in this population. However, it is rarely implemented given its limited availability. To address this barrier, we examined the ability of an easily accessible online CBT-I program to improve insomnia symptoms in cancer survivors. Methods: Twenty-eight cancer survivors with insomnia were randomly assigned to either an Internet insomnia intervention (n = 14) or to a waitlist control group (n = 14). The online program, Sleep Healthy Using The Internet, delivers the primary components of CBT-I (sleep restriction, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, sleep hygiene, and relapse prevention). Pre- and post-assessment data were collected via online questionnaires and daily sleep diaries. Results: Participants in the Internet group showed significant improvements at post-assessment compared with those in the control group in overall insomnia severity (F1,26 = 22.8; p<0.001), sleep efficiency (F1,24 = 11.45; P = 0.002), sleep onset latency (F1,24 = 5.18; P = 0.03), soundness of sleep (F 1,24 = 9.34; P = 0.005), restored feeling upon awakening (F 1,24 = 11.95; P = 0.002), and general fatigue (F1,26 = 13.88; P = 0.001). Although other group Ã— time interactions were not significant, overall adjusted effect sizes for all sleep variables as well as for fatigue, depression, anxiety, and quality of life ranged from small to large. Conclusions: CBT-I delivered through an interactive, individually tailored Internet intervention may be a viable treatment option for cancer survivors experiencing insomnia.

1518,Virtual Reality Exposure for PTSD Due to Military Combat and Terrorist Attacks,"Humans exposed to war and terrorist attacks are at risk for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Numerous reports indicate that the incidence of PTSD in both returning Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) military personnel and survivors of the 9/11 World Trade Center (WTC) attacks is significant. These situations have served to motivate research on how to better develop and disseminate evidence-based treatments for PTSD and other related psychosocial conditions. Virtual reality (VR) delivered exposure therapy for PTSD is currently being used to treat combat and terrorist attack related PTSD with initial reports of positive outcomes. This paper presents an overview and rationale for the use of VR exposure therapy with anxiety disorders and PTSD and describes the status of two systems (Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan and Virtual World Trade Center) developed for this purpose.

1519,â€˜We know it works but does it last?â€™ The implementation of the KEEP foster and kinship carer training programme in England,"Recent years have seen an increased availability of well-researched parenting programmes but few are designed to address the specific needs of foster carers, including kinship carers, or are able to demonstrate longer-term outcomes. The KEEP training programme (Keeping foster and kinship carers trained and supported) was developed by Dr Patricia Chamberlain in the US state of Oregon and brought over to England in 2009 by the Department for Education (DfE) as part of the drive to improve outcomes for looked after children. KEEP is designed to strengthen foster and kinship carer parenting skills, reduce foster childrenâ€™s behavioural and emotional difficulties and increase placement stability. Training programmes for carers of children aged from three to 17 are now running in 24 local authorities across the country. The implementation of the KEEP programme in England, supported by the National Implementation Service, includes outcome data on 572 children and young people and their carers that demonstrate significant improvements in child problem behaviour and carer stress, and positive changes in parenting discipline style consistent with findings from the original large randomised controlled trial. In addition, longer-term outcome data for six- and 12-month post-group follow-up for KEEP Standard (for carers of children aged 5â€“12 years) and KEEP Safe (for carers of adolescents) show that significant improvements in behavioural difficulties, foster carer stress and parenting discipline style are all maintained. Evidence for longer-term improvements in placement stability is currently limited by a lack of comparative data.

1520,Non-pharmacological interventions for preventing venous insufficiency in a standing worker population,"BackgroundChronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is a common problem, affecting up to 50% of the population in industrialised countries. It is a chronic condition which, if untreated, can progress to serious complications that in turn can interfere with working ability. Standing at work is a known risk factor for CVI, yet the true effect of non-pharmacological preventive strategies remains unknown. This is an update of a review first published in 2012.ObjectivesTo assess the efficacy of non-pharmacological strategies and devices to prevent CVI in a standing worker population.Search methodsFor this update the Cochrane Peripheral Vascular Diseases Group Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the Specialised Register (last searched September 2013) and CENTRAL (2013, Issue 8). We also handsearched reference lists of relevant studies.Selection criteriaRandomised and non-randomised controlled trials that recruited standing workers to evaluate non-pharmacological devices or strategies used to prevent CVI were eligible for inclusion. Trials had to report an objective measure of clinical features of CVI or complaints associated with this condition in order to be included.Data collection and analysisSelection of the trials, quality assessment and data abstraction were completed independently by two review authors. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Only one trial was eligible for inclusion in the review so we did not perform meta-analyses.Main resultsThe primary outcomes of this review were clinical features of CVI and its associated symptoms. No new included studies were identified for this update. One prospective cross-over trial was included in this review. It measured the effect of no compression followed by two phases with different gradients of compression stockings on symptoms in 19 female flight attendants who were required to stand, almostcontinuously, for long periods of time. The included study provided some evidence that compression stockings improved symptoms of leg fatigue in standing workers. However, the strength of the evidence in this review is weak as it is based on only one very small trial which was at high risk of bias. The included study did not address any of the secondary outcomes including quality of life or economic impact of the interventions. Nor did the study report the length of time that the population were required to stand at work. Furthermore, no trials were found which measured the effectiveness of other non-pharmacological interventions or strategies aimed at preventing CVI in standing workers.Authors' conclusionsDue to the extremely limited number of trials, there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for preventing CVI in standing workers. Further large-scale studies examining all possible non-pharmacological interventions and outcomes are required.","Robertson, Lindsay; Yeoh, Su Ern; Kolbach, Dinanda N.",0,10.1002/14651858.CD006345.pub3,1173
1521,Office ergonomics training and a sit-stand workstation: Effects on musculoskeletal and visual symptoms and performance of office workers,"Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) among office workers with intensive computer use is widespread and the prevalence of symptoms is growing. This randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of an office ergonomics training combined with a sit-stand workstation on musculoskeletal and visual discomfort, behaviors and performance. Participants performed a lab-based customer service job for 8 h per day, over 15 days and were assigned to: Ergonomics Trained (n = 11) or Minimally Trained (n = 11). The training consisted of: a 1.5-h interactive instruction, a sit/stand practice period, and ergonomic reminders. Ergonomics Trained participants experienced minimal musculoskeletal and visual discomfort across the 15 days, varied their postures, with significantly higher performance compared to the Minimally Trained group who had a significantly higher number of symptoms, suggesting that training plays a critical role. The ability to mitigate symptoms, change behaviors and enhance performance through training combined with a sit-stand workstation has implications for preventing discomforts in office workers.

Design: In the context of a community-based, randomized trial, we compared participation in a nurse-CHW team intervention with the standard community care that included a state Medicaid program ( enhanced prenatal services) with nurse home visiting. Sample: Medicaid-eligible pregnant women ( n = 5530), who maintained their pregnancies, had a live birth, retained custody of the child, completed more than an enrollment assessment, did not move out of the county, and were not lost to follow-up. Measurements: Provider reports of face-to-face prenatal contacts and demographic and psychosocial risk assessments obtained at study enrollment. Results: Significant differences in the number of women with prenatal program contact and the total amount of contact were found, favoring the nurse-CHW team approach. More women with risk characteristics were reached in the nurse-CHW team group, with the exception of women with alcohol and drug use risks. Conclusions: A nurse-CHW team approach demonstrated advantage in reaching women who had barriers to participation and delivering more intensive services.","Roman, Lee Anne; Lindsay, Judith K.; Moore, Joseph S.; Duthie, Patricia A.; Peck, Christie; Barton, Lauren R.; Gebben, Marcia R.; Baer, Lawrence J.",0,10.1111/j.1525-1446.2007.00630.x,1175

1527,High testosterone levels and sensitivity to acute stress in perpetrators of domestic violence with low cognitive flexibility and impairments in their emotional decoding process: A preliminary study,"Hormonal and neuropsychological impairment in intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetrators could play a role in domestic violence. For characterizing whether there is a specific psychobiological response to stress, participants who had previously been jailed for IPV and controls were compared for testosterone and cortisol levels, tested for 2D:4D ratio (as an indicator of masculinization), and given several trait questionnaires and neuropsychological tests related to executive functions and theory of mind. After performing the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), IPV perpetrators experienced decreases in salivary testosterone (T) levels, a moderate worsening of mood, slight anxiety, and a salivary cortisol (C) level increase. Moreover, high basal T was related with high levels of anger and anxiety and worse mood. However, that basal mood does not significantly alter T levels in response to stress. Nonetheless, controls experienced smaller changes in T and larger changes in C and psychological mood. With respect to neuropsychological and cognitive empathic features, IPV perpetrators showed poorer executive performance and emotional recognition than controls. In addition, deficits in both neuropsychological domains were positively associated. Regarding emotional empathy, IPV perpetrators showed higher levels of personal distress than controls. The 2D:4D ratio was lower in IPV perpetrators than in controls. Moreover, only in the former a smaller 2D:4D ratio was related to large increases in T in response to stress and poor emotional recognition. Together with social aspects involved in IPV, differences in psychobiological variables and their relationships could play a relevant role in the onset and perpetuation of violent behavior.

1528,Post-deployment screening for mental disorders and tailored advice about help-seeking in the UK military: a cluster randomised controlled trial,"Background The effectiveness of post-deployment screening for mental disorders has not been assessed in a randomised controlled trial. We aimed to assess whether post-deployment screening for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, or alcohol misuse was effective. We defined screening as the presumptive identification of a previously unrecognised disorder using tests to distinguish those who probably had the disorder from those who probably did not so that those people with a probable disorder could be referred appropriately, and assessed effectiveness and consequences for help-seeking by the odds ratio at follow-up between those receiving tailored help-seeking advice and those who received general mental health advice.Methods We did a cluster randomised controlled trial among Royal Marines and Army personnel in the UK military after deployment to Afghanistan. Platoons were randomly assigned (1: 1 initially, then 2: 1) by stratified block randomisation with randomly varying block sizes of two and four to the screening group, which received tailored help-seeking advice, or the control group, which received general mental health advice. Initial assessment took place 6-12 weeks after deployment; follow-up assessments were done 10-24 months later. Follow-up measures were the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), and self-reported help-seeking from clinical and welfare providers comparing those receiving tailored advice and those receiving only general advice. All participants and all investigators other than the person who analysed the data were masked to allocation. The primary outcomes were PTSD, depression or generalised anxiety disorder, and alcohol misuse at follow-up. A key secondary outcome was assessment of whether post-deployment screening followed by tailored advice would modify help-seeking behaviour. Comparisons were made between screening and control groups, with primary analyses by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN Registry, number ISRCTN19965528.Findings Between Oct 24, 2011, and Oct 31, 2014, 434 platoons comprising 10 190 personnel were included: 274 (6350 personnel) in the screening group and 160 (3840 personnel) in the control group. 5577 (88%) of 6350 personnel received screening and 3996 (63%) completed follow-up, whereas 3149 (82%) of 3840 received the control questionnaire and 2369 (62%) completed follow-up. 1958 (35%) of 5577 personnel in the screening group declined to see the tailored advice, but those with PTSD (83%) or anxiety or depression (84%) were more likely than non-cases (64%) to view the advice (both p<0.0001). At follow-up, there were no significant differences in prevalence between groups for PTSD (adjusted odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.75-1.14), depression or anxiety (0.91, 0.71-1.16), alcohol misuse (0.88, 0.73-1.06), or seeking support for mental disorders (0.92, 0.78-1. 08).Interpretation Post-deployment screening for mental disorders based on tailored advice was not effective at reducing prevalence of mental health disorders nor did it increase help-seeking. Countries that have implemented post-deployment screening programmes for mental disorders should consider monitoring the outcomes of their programmes.","Rona, Roberto J.; Burdett, Howard; Khondoker, Mizanur; Chesnokov, Melanie; Green, Kevin; Pernet, David; Jones, Norman; Greenberg, Neil; Wessely, Simon; Fear, Nicola T.",0,10.1016/S0140-6736(16)32398-4,1178
1530,Heat Stress Nephropathy From Exercise-Induced Uric Acid Crystalluria: A Perspective on Mesoamerican Nephropathy,"Mesoamerican nephropathy (MeN), an epidemic in Central America, is a chronic kidney disease of unknown cause. In this article, we argue that MeN may be a uric acid disorder. Individuals at risk for developing the disease are primarily male workers exposed to heat stress and physical exertion that predisposes to recurrent water and volume depletion, often accompanied by urinary concentration and acidification. Uric acid is generated during heat stress, in part consequent to nucleotide release from muscles. We hypothesize that working in the sugarcane fields may result in cyclic uricosuria in which uric acid concentrations exceed solubility, leading to the formation of dihydrate urate crystals and local injury. Consistent with this hypothesis, we present pilot data documenting the common presence of urate crystals in the urine of sugarcane workers from El Salvador. High end-of-workday urinary uric acid concentrations were common in a pilot study, particularly if urine pH was corrected to 7. Hyperuricemia may induce glomerular hypertension, whereas the increased urinary uric acid may directly injure renal tubules. Thus, MeN may result from exercise and heat stress associated with dehydration-induced hyperuricemia and uricosuria. Increased hydration with water and salt, urinary alkalinization, reduction in sugary beverage intake, and inhibitors of uric acid synthesis should be tested for disease prevention.

1532,The effectiveness of stress management intervention in a community-based program: Isfahan Healthy Heart Program,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of stress management training in improving the ability of coping with stress in a large population. METHODS: Five cross-sectional studies using multistage cluster random sampling were performed on adults aged â‰¥ 19 years between 2000 to 2005 in Isfahan and Najafabad (Iran) as intervention cities and Arak, Iran as the control city within the context of Isfahan Healthy Heart Program. Stress management training was adapted according to age and education levels of the target groups. In a 45-minute home interview, demographic data, General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) and stress management questionnaires were collected. Data was analyzed by t-test, linear regression and general linear model. RESULTS: Trends of both adaptive and maladaptive coping skills and GHQ scores from baseline to the last survey were statistically significant in both intervention and reference areas (P < 0.001). While adaptive coping skills increased significantly, maladaptive coping skills decreased significantly in the intervention areas. Furthermore, stress levels decreased significantly in the intervention compared to the reference area. CONCLUSION: Stress management programs could improve coping strategies at the community level and can be considered in designing behavioral interventions.","Roohafza H., Sarrafzadegan N., Sadeghi M., Talaei M., Talakar M., Mahvash M.",0,,1180

1535,A systematic review of single-session psychological interventions ('debriefing') following trauma,"Background: Single-session psychological interventions such as psychological debriefing have become widely used following traumatic events. The evidence for their effectiveness has been widely debated. This review aimed to consider the evidence for the effectiveness of one-off early interventions within 1 month of a traumatic event. Methods: A systematic review using the standard Cochrane Collaboration methodology. Literature searches of various databases were performed to identify randomised controlled trials. The methodological quality of the studies identified was determined using standard measures, and the results were pooled to consider the overall evidence for effectiveness. Results: Eleven randomised controlled trials were found, all of individual or couple interventions. Three studies associated the intervention with a positive outcome, 6 demonstrated no difference in outcome between intervention and non-intervention groups and 2 showed some negative outcomes in the intervention group (these studies had the longest follow-up periods). The methodological quality of the studies varied widely, but was generally poor. This review suggests that early optimism for brief early psychological interventions including debriefing was misplaced and that it should not be advocated for routine use.

1536,Promoting resilience in stress management: A pilot study of a novel resilience-promoting intervention for adolescents and young adults with serious illness,"Objective To examine the feasibility and format of the Promoting Resilience in Stress Management (PRISM) intervention among two groups of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) at-risk for poor outcomes: those with Type 1 diabetes (T1D) or cancer. Methods PRISM consists of two long or four short skills-based modules. English-speaking patients 12-25 years old were eligible if they had T1D for >6 months or cancer for >2 weeks. Feasibility was defined as an 80% completion rate and high satisfaction. Ongoing monitoring shaped iterative refinement of disease-specific approach. Results 12 of 15 patients with T1D (80%) completed the two-session intervention. 3 of 15 patients with cancer declined to complete the two-session version, citing prohibitive length of individual sessions. 12 (80%) completed the four-session version. Patient-reported satisfaction was high across groups. Conclusions The PRISM intervention is feasible and well-accepted by AYAs with cancer or T1D. Differences in patient populations warrant differences in approach. Â© The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Pediatric Psychology.

1539,Unplug - Don't drug: A critical look at the influence of technology on child behavior with an alternative way of responding other than evaluation and drugging,"The past decade has seen an increase in personal use of electronic technology, with childhood television and video game use similarly increasing. Critical milestones for child motor and sensory development are not being met. Simultaneously, there is an increasing incidence of childhood physical, psychological, and behavior disorders, often accompanied by the prescription of psychotropic medication. One in six children exhibit signs of poor health, mental stress, or problems at school. Exposure to an average of 8 hours per day of various forms of technology use has resulted in a physically sedentary yet chaotically stressed existence for Canadian children. The detrimental effects of technology use on critical milestones for child development are reviewed. This commentary by a pediatric occupational therapist outlines issues of concern for parents, family physicians, and pediatricians related to these trends and offers a novel treatment approach: Unplug - Don't Drug.

1540,When the levee breaks: Treating adolescents and families in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina,"Hurricane Katrina brought to the surface serious questions about the capacity of the public health system to respond to community-wide disaster. The storm and its aftermath severed developmentally protective family and community ties; thus its consequences are expected to be particularly acute for vulnerable adolescents. Research confirms that teens are at risk for a range of negative outcomes under conditions of life stress and family disorganization. Specifically, the multiple interacting risk factors for substance abuse in adolescence may be compounded when families and communities have experienced a major trauma. Further, existing service structures and treatments for working with young disaster victims may not address their risk for co-occurring substance abuse and traumatic stress reactions because they tend to be individually or peer group focused, and fail to consider the multi-systemic aspects of disaster recovery. This article proposes an innovative family-based intervention for young disaster victims, based on an empirically supported model for adolescent substance abuse, Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT; Liddle, 2002). Outcomes and mechanisms of the model's effects are being investigated in a randomized clinical trial with clinically referred substance-abusing teens in a New Orleans area community impacted by Hurricane Katrina.

1544,Evaluating trauma debriefing within the UK prison service,"Purpose: There has been wide debate around early interventions following traumatic exposures. Many of the studies examining the effectiveness of debriefing have not been undertaken in a workplace setting for which they were designed. The study was undertaken with prison staff and evaluated the debriefing provided as part of a trauma support programme provided by the prison service. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness and a programme of support for prison service staff following a traumatic incident within a prison environment. Design/methodology/approach: Prison staff exposed to a range of traumatic events were offered debriefing. Measurements were taken soon after the incident and again one month later. The scores of those receiving debriefing were compared with those who did not receive debriefing. Findings: The results showed that the prison staff receiving debriefing showed a significant reduction in their traumatic stress, anxiety and depression scores. There was no significant difference in the symptoms of the non-debriefed group. Research limitations//implications: The findings suggest that group-based well structured debrief sessions can be useful in reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress following exposure to critical incidents in the workplace. The findings were accepted with the limitation that the groups were self-selecting, a randomised control trial was not allowed for the purpose of this study due to ethical concerns. Originality/value: The results suggest that there are benefits in undertaking group debriefing within an organisational setting.

1545,Pilot Evaluation of Outcomes of Combined Parent-Child Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy for Families at Risk for Child Physical Abuse,"Child physical abuse (CPA) is not only a highly prevalent public health problem, but it has been associated with a wide range of debilitating psychosocial sequelae that may develop during childhood and persist into adulthood. This paper outlines a treatment model, Combined Parent-Child Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CPC-CBT), that addresses the complex needs of the parent who engages in physically abusive behavior and the traumatized child. This pilot program was conducted to examine the feasibility of a CBT group approach that incorporates the child into the offending parent's treatment. It highlights the use of gradual exposure, developing a trauma narrative and abuse clarification to address PTSD symptoms in children. Parent components include motivational interviewing and consequence review, cognitive and behavioral anger-control strategies, and the examination of parent-child interactions to assist parents in modulating their emotions, remaining calm, and using effective problem-solving during child-rearing situations. Pilot data examining pre- to posttreatment changes for parents and children participating in the 16-week group treatment program are presented. Participants were 12 caregivers, ages 25 to 54, and their 21 children, ages 4 to 14, who were referred for the treatment of issues related to CPA. About 48% of participating parents were referred for substantiated CPA against their children, while the other parents were deemed to be at-risk for CPA. Both parents and children reported significant pre- to posttreatment reductions in the use of physical punishment. Results also demonstrated pre- to posttreatment improvements in parental anger toward their children, and consistent parenting as well as children's posttraumatic stress symptoms and behavioral problems. Clinical and research implications for these preliminary findings are discussed. Â© 2008.","Runyon M.K., Deblinger E., Schroeder C.M.",0,10.1016/j.cbpra.2008.09.006,1189
1547,"The relevance of selenium to immunity, cancer, and infectious/inflammatory diseases","Selenium is an essential trace element involved in several key metabolic activities via selenoproteins, enzymes that are essential to protect against oxidative damage and to regulate immune function. Selenium also may have other health benefits unrelated to its enzymatic functions. it may provide important health benefits to people whose oxidative stress loads are high, such as those with inflammatory or infectious diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or who are at high risk for cancers, particularly prostate cancer. Some studies have generated compelling evidence that selenium is beneficial, either alone or in conjunction with other micronutrients. Additional data from large clinical trials that provide the highest level of evidence will be key to determining the benefits accrued at various selenium intake levels. When the strength of the evidence becomes sufficient, clinical health professionals will need to use dietary and clinical assessment methods to ensure that people at increased risk for cancer or inflammatory and infectious diseases can be appropriately advised about selenium intake.","Ryan-Harshman, M; Aldoori, W",0,10.3148/66.2.2005.98,1190
1550,"Effect of cognitive pain self-management program on depression, anxiety, and stress in women with chronic musculoskeletal pain: A pilot study","Background: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a worldwide health problem. Anxiety and depression are common among patients suffering from chronic pain. Self-management strategies are used to help patients manage the emotional distress associated with pain. Aim: To evaluate the effects of cognitive pain self-management program (CPSMP) on depression, anxiety, and stress in women with chronic pain. Method: This pilot study with a pretest-posttest design performed on 20 women with chronic pain, who were referred to Imam-Reza and Qaem Clinic Centers and Clinical Psychology Center of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, during June-October 2014. The participants randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The intervention comprised of eight 120-min weekly group sessions. CPSMP employs the principles of cognitive therapy and self-management program strategies. The control group received regular treatment sessions. At pre-and post-test, the participants completed Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The data were analyzed using Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: The mean ages of the intervention and control groups were 35.2Ã¯Â¿Â½9 and 32.5Ã¯Â¿Â½11 years, respectively. After the intervention, Mann-Whitney U test did not reflect a significant difference between the intervention and control groups in terms of depression (P=0.14). Moreover, the results of Mann-Whitney test revealed a significant difference between the groups regarding anxiety (P<0.001) and stress (P=0.04).

1551,Trauma-Informed HIV Prevention and Treatment,"The high prevalence of trauma and its negative impact on health and health-promoting behaviors underscore the need for multi-level interventions to address trauma and its associated sequelae to improve physical and mental well-being in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected populations. Growing global awareness of the intersection of trauma and HIV has resulted in development and testing of interventions to address trauma in the context of HIV treatment and HIV prevention in the USA and globally. Despite increasing recognition of the widespread nature of trauma and the importance of trauma to HIV transmission around the globe, several gaps remain. Through a survey of the literature, we identified eight studies (published in the past 5 years) describing interventions to address the effects of trauma on HIV-related outcomes. In particular, this study focused on the levels of intervention, populations the interventions were designed to benefit, and types of trauma addressed in the interventions in the context of both HIV prevention and treatment. Remarkably absent from the HIV prevention, interventions reviewed were interventions designed to address violence experienced by men or transgender individuals, in the USA or globally. Given the pervasive nature of trauma experienced generally, but especially among individuals at heightened risk for HIV, future HIV prevention interventions universally should consider becoming trauma-informed. Widespread acknowledgement of the pervasive impact of gender-based violence on HIV outcomes among women has led to multiple calls for trauma-informed care (TIC) approaches to improve the effectiveness of HIV services for HIV-infected women. TIC approaches may be relevant for and should also be tested among men and all groups with high co-occurring epidemics of HIV and trauma (e.g., men who have sex with men (MSM), transgendered populations, injection drug users, sex workers), regardless of type of trauma experience.","Sales, Jessica M.; Swartzendruber, Andrea; Phillips, Ashley L.",0,10.1007/s11904-016-0337-5,1192
1552,"Effects of physical exercise on anxiety, depression, and sensitivity to stress: A unifying theory","Until recently, claims for the psychological benefits of physical exercise have tended to precede supportive evidence. Acutely, emotional effects of exercise remain confusing, both positive and negative effects being reported. Results of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are more consistent in indicating that aerobic exercise training has antidepressant and anxiolytic effects and protects against harmful consequences of stress. Details of each of these effects remain unclear. Antidepressant and anxiolytic effects have been demonstrated most clearly in subclinical disorder, and clinical applications remain to be exploited. Cross-sectional studies link exercise habits to protection from harmful effects of stress on physical and mental health, but causality is not clear. Nevertheless, the pattern of evidence suggests the theory that exercise training recruits a process which confers enduring resilience to stress. This view allows the effects of exercise to be understood in terms of existing psychobiological knowledge, and it can thereby provide the theoretical base that is needed to guide future research in this area. Clinically, exercise training continues to offer clinical psychologists a vehicle for nonspecific therapeutic social and psychological processes. It also offers a specific psychological treatment that may be particularly effective for patients for whom more conventional psychological interventions are less acceptable.

1553,Effect of Home Visiting with PREGNANT TEENS ON MATERNAL HEALTH,"Purpose: Determine the extent that participation in Resource Mothers Program (RMP) home visiting improves maternal health at 3 months postpartum.Study Design and Methods: A randomized controlled trial using RMPs in two urban and one rural location in a mid-Atlantic state. Community health workers from these RMPs enrolled teens into the study and the research team assigned participants to either the intervention group or telephone support control group using computerized randomization assignments. Data collection. from baseline and 3 months postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Prenatal Psychosocial Profile (PPP) is reported.Results: The sample included 150 pregnant teens with a mean age of 17 years. Mean self-esteem scores between groups were not significantly different at baseline, but the RMP group self-esteem scores improved significantly at the 3 months postpartum interview (36.40 +/- 5.63 for RMP vs. 34.10 +/- 4.29 telephone control group, p = 0.049). Neither group was at risk for depression at baseline or 3 months postpartum. Because 60% of the total sample identified as Hispanic, post hoc analysis revealed significantly different baseline stress mean scores between Hispanic and non-Hispanic teens (p = 0.038); however, these differences were no longer significant by 3 months postpartum (p = 0.073). The EPDS scores by ethnicity were not different at baseline (p = 0.875) but were significantly different at 3 months (p = 0.007).Clinical Implications: The RMP home-visiting intervention can lead to improved self-esteem scores in teens, particularly in Hispanic teens. Improved self-esteem has been shown to lead to better parenting.","Samankasikorn, Wilaiporn; Pierce, Brittany; Ivany, Amanda St.; Gwon, Seok Hyun; Schminkey, Donna; Bullock, Linda",0,10.1097/NMC.0000000000000235,1194
1554,Assessing maladaptive repetitive thought in clinical disorders: A critical review of existing measures,"Rumination and worry have recently been grouped under the broader transdiagnostic construct of repetitive thought (Watkins, 2008). The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of scales used to assess repetitive thinking across a broad range of contexts: depression, anxiety, trauma, stress, illness, interpersonal difficulties, positive affect, and so forth. We also include scales developed or adapted for children and adolescents. In the extant literature, measures of repetitive thinking generally show small-to-moderate correlations with measures of psychopathology. This review highlights problems with the content validity of existing instruments; for example, confounds between repetitive thought and symptomatology, metacognitive beliefs, and affect. This review also builds on previous reviews by including newer transdiagnostic measures of repetitive thinking. We hope that this review will help to expand our understanding of repetitive thinking beyond the mood and anxiety disorders, and suggest ways forward in the measurement of repetitive thinking in individuals with comorbid conditions.

1555,The Working for Wellness Program: RCT of an Employee Well-Being Intervention,"This paper details the design and evaluation of a positive psychology-based employee well-being program. The effect of the program on well-being was evaluated using a mixed method design comprising of an RCT to assess outcome effectiveness, and participant feedback and facilitator field notes to assess process and impact effectiveness. Fifty government employees were randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group (reduced to n = 23 for complete case analysis). The intervention group participated in the 6-week Working for Wellness Program and completed measures of subjective, psychological, affective and work-related well-being (SWB, PWB, AWB and WWB) at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and three and 6 month follow-ups. The control group completed the questionnaires only. As predicted, mixed ANOVAs revealed improvements in SWB and PWB for intervention group participants over time relative to control participants but these effects had reduced by time 4. There was a main effect of group on AWB in the predicted direction but no effect on WWB. Participant feedback indicated that the focus on strengths and group delivery were the most effective components of the program. Key issues were sample attrition and a lack of on-the-job support for change. Findings suggest employees can learn effective strategies for sustainably increasing their subjective and psychological well-being.

1560,The positive effects of a peer-led intervention system for individuals with a risk of metabolic syndrome,"Background: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major health risk in Thailand. Although it is reported that females have a higher rate of MetS than males, very few peer-led intervention studies have been conducted on specific groups, such as seamstresses, at risk of MetS. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a peer-led intervention program on reducing MetS risk factors in individuals working in Thai Uniform Sewing Military Factories.Methods: A quasiexperimental program was introduced using a pre-and posttest design that was applied to female sewing factory workers selected for this research. All participants had at least one of the key MetS symptoms. The experimental group (N=50 participants) received 12 weekly peer-led individual support discussion sessions that included both dietary and physical activity (PA) advice and the control group (N=50 participants) followed their usual daily routines. The Student's t-test and the Pearson's chi-squared test were used to compare the differences of baseline data and analysis of variance was used for analysis of the data after intervention.Results: The results showed that after 3 months of participation, when compared to the control group, the experimental group had significantly improved systolic blood pressure (BP) (P=0.04), diastolic BP (P<0.001), PA (P=0.05), knowledge scores of MetS, perception of MetS and risk factors (P<0.001), and stress assessment (P=0.002). Waist circumference, body mass index, and Food Frequency Questionnaire score were not significantly different but still improved.Conclusion: Findings from this study suggest that a peer-led support program can be introduced as an effective means of improving the behaviors of mostly sedentary factory workers at risk of MetS caused by working habits that are detrimental to health.","Sanee, Aree; Somrongthong, Ratana; Plianbangchang, Samlee",0,10.2147/JMDH.S142272,1199
1564,Effectiveness of instrumental reminiscence intervention on improving coping in healthy older adults,"Reminiscence is a psychological intervention that uses the recall of past events, feelings, and thoughts to facilitate pleasure, quality of life, and adjustment to present life. The main goal of this study was to investigate the effect of a reminiscence intervention programme on coping strategies. One hundred fifty healthy older adults attended the reminiscence sessions. In order to evaluate the effects of the programme and find out if its effects lasted over time, we used an experimental design with pretest, posttest, and follow-up assessments, comparing a control group to the intervention group. Repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant differences in problem-solving coping, positive reappraisal, social support seeking, and avoidance coping with the treatment group obtaining higher scores than the control group in all cases. The effects declined after 3Â months, but some differences were found in the treatment group obtaining higher scores in problem-solving coping and positive reappraisal and lower in overt emotional expression. The study suggests that reminiscence therapy contributes to mental health by enhancing coping strategies that can allow the elderly to cope successfully and overcome psychological distress.

1566,Quality of life and burden of spouses of Alzheimer disease patients,"The objective of the study was to explore, in a sample of spouses of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease patients, predictors of quality of life (QoL) by rating QoL and burden. The authors assessed 97 spouses in a cross-sectional study with the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life (SEIQoL), Self-Rated Burden scale (SRB), self-perceived stress scale (EDIZ; Ervaren Druk door Informele Zorg/Self-Perceived Pressure from Informal Care), and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Patient cognition was rated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Factors best predicting QoL were analyzed with multiple regression analysis. Eighty-seven (53% male, mean 72 y) fulfilled the SEIQoL internal reliability criteria, and had a mean SEIQoL score of 68.6Â±14.8. Most important QoL domains were condition of patient (31%) and marriage (26%). Caregiver burden scores on SRB, Ervaren Druk door Informele, Zorg, and ZBI were 44.1Â±23.5 (n=67), 4.9Â±2.2 (n=53), and 13.1Â±6.2 (n=53), respectively. Mean patient MMSE score (0 to 30) was 20.3Â±4.2. Spouses experienced lower QoL than Alzheimer disease patients and healthy elderly (historical controls), and perceived moderate levels of burden. Patient cognition is a significant predictor of caregiver QoL. Burden, measured by ZBI, is significantly negatively correlated with SEIQoL. The results underline the importance of implementing health services known to improve QoL and alleviate burden, and to explore new effective interventions.

1567,Costs and benefits of self-efficacy: Differences of the stress response and clinical implications,"Encounters with stressors induce diverse idiosyncratic neuroendocrine, behavioral and psychological reactions across people. Perceived self-efficacy can alter autonomic responses and their effects on mental health. The beneficial effects of self-efficacy in buffering physiological arousal, enhancing performance, and diminishing psychopathological symptoms have been observed in diverse contexts. We show that the role of self-efficacy is not uniformly beneficial, and that higher levels of self-efficacy can sometimes lead to increases in neuroendocrine and psychological stress responses and decreases in performance, a phenomenon that has been widely neglected. We discuss specific conditions under which self-efficacy effects do not uniformly ameliorate or prevent the consequences of stress. These conditions suggest that therapeutic interventions need not always promote self-efficacy in principal. Simultaneously, they to do suggest that keeping self-efficacy high might be disadvantageous or detrimental.

1569,Dealing with a 'hidden stressor': Emotional disclosure as a coping strategy to overcome the negative effects of motive incongruence on health,"Taking the affiliation motive as an example, present research examines whether the negative effects of implicit-explicit motive incongruence on health is moderated by emotional disclosure. Starting from the point of view that motive incongruence works as a chronic stressor and therefore causes impairment of health, we predicted that participants who use the stress-reducing coping strategy of emotional disclosure should be less affected by the negative effects of motive incongruence on health than participants who do not use this stress-coping strategy. Two studies confirmed this hypothesis. Participants with affiliation motive incongruence who practiced emotional disclosure used less medication (Study 1, n = 85) and reported lower somatization symptoms (Study 2, n = 102) than motive incongruent individuals who did not disclose their emotions to others.

Thus, a need exists for disseminable, mechanism-targeted approaches to reducing risk of youth psychopathology. Accordingly, we conducted a randomized-controlled trial testing whether a single-session intervention teaching growth personality mindsets (the belief that personality is malleable) reduced known risk factors for anxiety and depression in adolescents experiencing or at risk for internalizing problems (NÂ =Â 96, ages 12â€“15). Compared to a supportive-therapy control, a 30-min computer-guided mindset intervention strengthened adolescentsâ€™ perceived control; this improvement was associated with increases in growth mindsets. Further, electrodermal activity recovery slopes showed that youths receiving the mindset intervention recovered from a lab-based social stressor over three times as fast as control group youths. Improvements in growth mindsets and perceived control were linked with faster stress recovery. Results suggest a disseminable strategy for reducing internalizing problem risk among adolescents.

1573,Protective creams fail to prevent solvent-induced cumulative skin irritation - results of a randomized double-blind study,"BackgroundOccupational skin contact with lipophilic substances is a risk factor for the development of irritant hand dermatitis. Skin protection creams form part of the personal protective equipment, and some are claimed to protect against lipophilic irritants. However, their benefit against solvents is under debate.ObjectivesTo evaluate the efficacy of barrier creams claimed to protect against lipophilic irritants in a newly developed repetitive irritation model.MethodsThirty-five healthy volunteers were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized study, and six barrier creams were evaluated against irritation induced by two occupationally relevant model solvents, n-octane and cumene. Clinical scoring and bioengineering methods (capacitance and transepidermal water loss measurements) were used to quantify the irritant reactions.ResultsNone of the test products offered protection against n-octane-induced clinical irritation or stratum corneum dehydration. One test product significantly aggravated the skin irritation induced by both irritants, and a second one enhanced dehydration induced by n-octane only.ConclusionsThe lack of efficacy and the aggravation of skin irritation induced by two of six test products stress the need for standardized efficacy testing of occupational skin protection products.","Schliemann, Sibylle; Kleesz, Peter; Elsner, Peter",0,10.1111/cod.12103,1207
1574,A longitudinal investigation of sleep quality in adolescents and young adults after mild traumatic brain injury,"Objective and Background: We examined sleep-related problems in adolescents and young adults after a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) or orthopedic injury. We extended the analysis of data from a study of early emotional and neuropsychological sequelae in these populations (McCauley et al. 2014. J Neurotrauma. 31:914). Methods: We gave the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to 77 participants with MTBI, 71 with orthopedic injury, and 43 noninjured controls. The age range was 12 to 30 years. We tested sleep quality within 96 hours of injury and at 1- and 3-month follow-up. Participants also completed measures of pain and fatigue, drug and alcohol use, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Results: Older participants (mean age=25 years) in the MTBI group exhibited a sharp increase in sleep-related symptoms between the baseline assessment and 1 month, and still had difficulties at 3 months. Younger participants with MTBI (mean age = 15 years) and older participants with an orthopedic injury had modest increases in sleep difficulties between baseline and 1 month. The participants with MTBI also had more clinically significant sleep difficulties at all 3 assessments. At 3 months, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores in younger participants with MTBI and all participants with orthopedic injury did not differ significantly from the non-injured controls'. The controls had no significant change in their sleep symptoms during the 3 months. Conclusions: Sleep difficulties in young adults may persist for r3 months after MTBI and exceed those after orthopedic injury. Clinicians should seek and treat sleep-related problems after MTBI.

First, we examine existing prevention interventions and discuss what features are common among successful interventions, as well as those that have failed. We identify notable prevention intervention lacunae, with respect to limited interventions that target MSM of color, younger MSM, and other MSM who are HIV infected-prevention for positives. We then consider several contemporary social forces that will affect the trajectory of the HIV epidemic and how these forces are or could be leveraged for intervention: minority stress and syndemic morbidities; marriage equality; healthcare reform; increasing digital communication technology; and an aging infected population. We then describe several promising novel or emerging prevention strategies that leverage networks to address new HIV transmission among MSM in the USA.

STRESS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM","Many interactive computer systems are being developed to provide health-related information to the public, but little research has explored how these systems should interact with their users to have the greatest impact. In the present study, 267 subjects were randomly dispersed among four versions of a computerized, interactive telephone-based stress management program in a two-by-two factorial design. Two of the versions offered personalized messages; in the other two, messages were not personalized. Two of the versions contained homework assignments; two did not. The results suggested that personalization and homework motivated subjects to continue calling the program to comply with the suggestions in the program, and to report that the program was helpful. Subjects whose messages were not personalized were more likely than other subjects to value empathic comments in the messages and to leave voice mail for the staff of the program. These results suggest that subjects prefer interactions with a computer to be conversational and directly responsive to their particular expectations.","SCHNEIDER, SJ; SCHWARTZ, MD; FAST, J",0,10.1016/0747-5632(94)00031-C,1210
1579,"Stress and health: Psychological, behavioral, and biological determinants","Stressors have a major influence upon mood, our sense of well-being, behavior, and health. Acute stress responses in young, healthy individuals may be adaptive and typically do not impose a health burden. However, if the threat is unremitting, particularly in older or unhealthy individuals, the long-term effects of stressors can damage health. The relationship between psychosocial stressors and disease is affected by the nature, number, and persistence of the stressors as well as by the individual's biological vulnerability (i.e., genetics, constitutional factors), psychosocial resources, and learned patterns of coping. Psychosocial interventions have proven useful for treating stress-related disorders and may influence the course of chronic diseases. Copyright Â© 2005 by Annual Reviews.

1580,Posttraumatic stress disorder and quality of life: Extension of findings to veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,"The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan-Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, or OEF/OIF-have created unique conditions for promoting the development of psychological difficulties such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is an important outcome because it can affect quality of life, impairing psychosocial and occupational functioning and overall well-being. The literature on PTSD and quality of life in OEF/OIF Veterans is at an early stage, but the consistency of the evidence is striking. Our review indicates that the findings on PTSD and quality of life in OEF/OIF veterans are comparable to findings obtained from other war cohorts and from nonveterans as well. Even though the duration of PTSD in OEF/OIF Veterans is much shorter than in Vietnam Veterans, for example, those with PTSD in both cohorts are likely to experience poorer functioning and lower objective living conditions and satisfaction. The review ends with discussion of the implications of the evidence for research and clinical practice.","Schnurr P.P., Lunney C.A., Bovin M.J., Marx B.P.",0,10.1016/j.cpr.2009.08.006,1212

Psycho-education has been suggested to reduce the risk of post-injury disorders. Aims: We tested the efficacy of providing self-help information to a high-risk sample. Methods: A&E attenders were screened for acute stress disorder and randomised to two groups: patients (n=116) receiving a self-help booklet and those who did not (n=111). A sample of 'low' scorers was also included (n=120); they did not receive a booklet. Psychological assessments were completed at baseline (within 1 month post-injury) and 3 and 6 months post-injury. Results: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression decreased (p<0.001) across time but there were no group differences in these measures or quality of life. However, subjective ratings of the usefulness of the self-help booklet were very high. Conclusions: This trial failed to support the efficacy of providing self-help information, as a preventative strategy to ameliorate PTSD. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

1585,Mental Health Problems in a School Setting in Children and Adolescents,"Background: 10-20% of children and adolescents have a mental health problem of some type. Manifestations such as attention deficits, cognitive disturbances, lack of motivation, and negative mood all adversely affect scholastic development. It is often unclear what factors associated with school affect children's mental development and what preventive measures and interventions at school might be effective.Methods: This review is based on systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized and non-randomized controlled trials that were retrieved by a selective search in the PubMed, PsycInfo, and Google Scholar databases.Results: The prevalence of hyperkinetic disorder is 1-6%. Its main manifestations are motor hyperactivity, an attention deficit, and impulsive behavior. Learning disorders such as dyscalculia and dyslexia affect 4-6% of children each, while 4-5% of children and adolescents suffer from depression, which is twice as prevalent in girls as in boys. Mental health problems increase the risk of repeating a grade, truancy, and dropping out of school. The risk of developing an internalizing or externalizing mental health problem can be lessened by changes in the school environment and by the implementation of evidence-based school programs.Conclusion: Physicians, in collaboration with school social workers and psychologists, should help teachers recognize and contend with mental health problems among the children and adolescents whom they teach, to enable the timely detection of stress factors at school and the initiation of the necessary measures and aids. In particular, the school-entrance examination and screening for risk factors at school can make a positive contribution. Evidence-based preventive programs should be implemented in schools, and beneficial changes of the school environment should be a further goal.","Schulte-Koerne, Gerd",0,10.3238/arztebl.2016.0183,1214
1588,A comprehensive review of the barriers and promoters health workers experience in delivering prevention of vertical transmission of HIV services in sub-Saharan Africa,"Despite significant biomedical and policy advances, 199,000 infants and young children in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) became infected with HIV in 2013, indicating challenges to implementation of these advances. To understand the nature of these challenges, we sought to (1) characterize the barriers and facilitators that health workers encountered delivering prevention of vertical transmission of HIV (PVT) services in SSA and (2) evaluate the use of theory to guide PVT service delivery. The PubMed and CINAHL databases were searched using keywords barriers, facilitators, HIV, prevention of vertical transmission of HIV, health workers, and their synonyms to identify relevant studies. Barriers and facilitators were coded at ecological levels according to the Determinants of Performance framework. Factors in this framework were then classified as affecting motivation, opportunity, or ability, per the Motivation-Opportunity-Ability (MOA) framework in order to evaluate domains of health worker performance within each ecological level. We found that the most frequently reported challenges occurred within the health facility level and spanned all three MOA domains. Barriers reported in 30% or more of studies from most proximal to distal included those affecting health worker motivation (stress, burnout, depression), patient opportunity (stigma), work opportunity (poor referral systems), health facility opportunity (overburdened workload, lack of supplies), and health facility ability (inadequate PVT training, inconsistent breastfeeding messages). Facilitators were reported in lower frequencies than barriers and tended to be resolutions to challenges (e.g., quality supervision, consistent supplies) or responses to an intervention (e.g., record systems and infrastructure improvements). The majority of studies did not use theory to guide study design or implementation. Interventions addressing health workers multiple ecological levels of interactions, particularly the health facility, hold promise for far-reaching impact as distal factors influence more proximal factors. Incorporating theory that considers factors beyond the health worker will strengthen endeavors to mitigate barriers to PVT service delivery.

1593,Verbal memory functioning moderates psychotherapy treatment response for PTSD-Related nightmares,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with cognitive deficits in attention, executive control, and memory, although few studies have investigated the relevance of cognitive difficulties for treatment outcomes. We examined whether cognitive functioning and history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) were associated with response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for PTSD-related sleep problems. In a randomized controlled trial of Imagery Rehearsal (IR) added to components of CBT for Insomnia (IR + cCBT-I) compared to cCBT-I alone for PTSD-related recurrent nightmares, 94 U.S. veterans completed a battery of cognitive tests. TBI was assessed via structured clinical interview. Mixed-effects models examined main effects of cognitive functioning and interactions with time on primary sleep and nightmare outcomes. Significant verbal immediate memory by time interactions were found for nightmare distress, nightmare frequency, and sleep quality, even after controlling for overall cognitive performance and depression. TBI exhibited main effects on outcomes but no interactions with time. Findings indicated that individuals with lower verbal memory performance were less likely to respond to treatment across two sleep interventions. Veterans with TBI displayed greater symptoms but no altered trajectories of treatment response. Together with prior literature, findings suggest that verbal memory functioning may be important to consider in PTSD treatment implementation.

1594,Quantitative meta-analysis of neurocognitive functioning in posttraumatic stress disorder,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with regional alterations in brain structure and function that are hypothesized to contribute to symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with the disorder. We present here the first systematic meta-analysis of neurocognitive outcomes associated with PTSD to examine a broad range of cognitive domains and describe the profile of cognitive deficits, as well as modifying clinical factors and study characteristics. This report is based on data from 60 studies totaling 4,108 participants, including 1,779 with PTSD, 1,446 trauma-exposed comparison participants, and 895 healthy comparison participants without trauma exposure. Effect-size estimates were calculated using a mixed-effects meta-analysis for 9 cognitive domains: attention/working memory, executive functions, verbal learning, verbal memory, visual learning, visual memory, language, speed of information processing, and visuospatial abilities. Analyses revealed significant neurocognitive effects associated with PTSD, although these ranged widely in magnitude, with the largest effect sizes in verbal learning (d = -.62), speed of information processing (d = -.59), attention/working memory (d = -.50), and verbal memory (d = -.46). Effect-size estimates were significantly larger in treatment-seeking than community samples and in studies that did not exclude participants with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and effect sizes were affected by between-group IQ discrepancies and the gender composition of the PTSD groups. Our findings indicate that consideration of neuropsychological functioning in attention, verbal memory, and speed of information processing may have important implications for the effective clinical management of persons with PTSD. Results are further discussed in the context of cognitive models of PTSD and the limitations of this literature.

1595,"Does perceived life stress mediate the association between HIV status and alcohol use? Evidence from adults living in Cape Town, South Africa","South Africa has the highest prevalence of HIV in the world. Because living with HIV is stressful and because alcohol consumption is often used to cope with stress, we examined whether stress mediates the association between HIV status and alcohol use among adults residing in South African townships. Field workers approached pedestrians or patrons of informal alcohol-serving venues (i.e., shebeens) and invited their participation in a survey. Of the 1717 participants (98% Black, 34% women, mean age = 31 years), 82% were HIV-negative, 9% were HIV-positive, and 9% did not know their test result. Participants living with HIV reported greater perceived life stress compared to participants whose HIV status was negative or unknown. Perceived stress was associated with an increase in the frequency of alcohol use (drinking days, intoxication, and drinking in shebeens/taverns). Subsequent analyses showed that stress mediated the association between HIV status and alcohol use. These findings indicate that greater frequency of drinking days, perceived intoxication, and drinking at shebeens was associated with elevated stress levels among participants who were HIV positive. Perceived life stress mediates the association between HIV status and alcohol use. Programs to enhance stress management among HIV-positive South Africans may help to reduce alcohol consumption, which may, in turn, lead to reduced rates of HIV transmission.

1596,The ICD shock and stress management program: A randomized trial of psychosocial treatment to optimize quality of life in ICD patients,"Background: Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients potentially face significant psychological distress because of their risk for life-threatening arrhythmias and the occurrence of ICD shock. Methods: The purpose of this study was to test an ICD stress and shock management program delivered in either a six-week format or a one-day workshop format. This intervention was aimed at reducing psychological (anxiety) and physiological (salivary cortisol) markers of distress in ICD patients. Secondary endpoints included measures of quality of life (QOL) and patient acceptance of device therapy, as well as biological mediators of inflammation (TNFÎ± and IL-6). Results: The ICD stress and shock management program resulted in the reduction of anxiety (P < 0.05) and cortisol levels (P < 0.05) in both the six weekly sessions format and the one-day workshop. Measures of anxiety decreased more rapidly with weekly intervention (P = 0.05). Both formats also resulted in a significant increase in patient acceptance of the ICD (P < 0.01). Follow-up assessment from posttreatment (T2) to four-month follow-up (T4) indicated no significant change in depression scores from posttreatment for all groups taken together, but there was a significant group by time effect, such that the workshop group displayed an increase in depression scores from T2 (M = 8.71, SD = 4.39) to T4 (M = 13.57, SD = 11.90), P < 0.05. Conclusions: These results suggest that structured interventions for shocked ICD patients involving ICD education and cognitive-behavioral strategies can reduce psychological distress and improve quality of life, regardless of format.

1597,"The Influence of Stress, Gender, and Culture on Type 2 Diabetes Prevention and Management Among Black Men: A Qualitative Analysis","This study used focus-group methodology to seek understanding about the unique influence of stress, gender, and culture on type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) prevention and management among Black men. Twenty men from Iowa were recruited from a larger longitudinal study on Black families; each of these men participated in one of three focus groups. Ninety-five percent of the men in the sample were Black and all were either diagnosed with t2dm (n = 10), were prediabetic (n = 1), or had experience with t2dm through family and friends (n = 9). Our results revealed the existence of significant stress and some pessimism with respect to perceived ability to prevent and manage t2dm. The participants made it clear that, while their families are primary sources of support for managing stress, including t2dm, they can also be a source of stress, particularly with respect to parenting. Black men had mixed opinions on their relationships with respect to their health care providers; some had positive, long-standing relationships while others reported little or no relationship with their providers. In response to life stress, Black men reported experiencing inadequate and disrupted sleep as well as consuming too much alcohol at times. Some of the participants reported engaging in physical activity to manage their stress. The study concluded that, as researchers develop t2dm prevention and management programs, they should continue to consider the unique role that stress in its various forms, plays in the lives of Black men.

The mist-fan group perceived themselves to be cooler even at elevated core temperatures.Conclusions: The mist fan and cooling towel were both ineffective at lowering core temperature. Core temperature continued to increase after exercise in all groups. The mist fan produced feelings of coolness while the core temperature remained elevated, possibly increasing the risk of heat illness.","Sefton, JoEllen M.; McAdam, J. S.; Pascoe, David D.; Lohse, K.

1602,Treating anxiety with mindfulness: An open trial of mindfulness training for anxious children,"This study is an open clinical trial that examined the feasibility and acceptability of a mindfulness training program for anxious children. We based this pilot initiative on a cognitively oriented model, which suggests that, since impaired attention is a core symptom of anxiety, enhancing self-management of attention should effect reductions in anxiety. Mindfulness practices are essentially attention enhancing techniques that have shown promise as clinical treatments for adult anxiety and depression (Baer, 2003). However, little research explores the potential benefits of mindfulness to treat anxious children. The present study provided preliminary support for our model of treating childhood anxiety with mindfulness. A 6-week trial was conducted with five anxious children aged 7 to 8 years old. The results of this study suggest that mindfulness can be taught to children and holds promise as an intervention for anxiety symptoms. Results suggest that clinical improvements may be related to initial levels of attention. Â© 2005 Springer Publishing Company.","Semple R.J., Reid E.F.G., Miller L.",0,10.1891/jcop.2005.19.4.379,1226

This paper describes an intervention where some of the skills used by specialist nurses and other staff from an eating disorder intensive care setting are taught to carers to improve their sense of competency and alleviate their distress. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of ""the Maudsley eating disorder collaborative care skills workshops"" programme among care givers and whether the difficulties and distress involved in caring for a person with an eating disorder were reduced. Methods: Thirty-five carers from 30 families were invited to participate in this programme, which consisted of a total of six workshops, delivered in 2-h sessions over 3 months. Assessments were undertaken at baseline (T0), at the end of the workshops (T1) and 3 months later (T2). Results: The level of carer distress (GHQ) fell significantly after the intervention. The level of general care giving burden (ECI) also reduced as did the specific difficulties caused by eating disorder symptoms (EDSIS). These changes were maintained over time (T2). Conclusions: The transfer of specialist skills within the programme was highly valued by the carers and lessened their stress and care giving difficulties.

Participants were matched for age, gender, race, education, and current prescription opioid use. Measures of pain, functioning, and quality of life were completed at admission and discharge. Medical chart review was conducted to assess medication and substance use history. Results Participants with a positive screen for THC were more likely to report a past history of illicit substance use, alcohol abuse, and current tobacco use. Cannabis use was not associated with a significantly lower morphine equivalence level for participants using prescription opioids (nÂ =Â 14). Both groups of participants reported significant improvement in pain severity, pain interference, depressive symptoms, and pain catastrophizing. There were no group- or treatment-related differences in these outcome variables. Discussion Results provide preliminary evidence that patients with chronic pain using cannabis may benefit from an interdisciplinary chronic pain program. Patients with chronic pain using cannabis may be at higher risk for substance-related negative outcomes, although more research is needed to understand this relationship.

1607,Efficacy of the virtual reality-based stress management program on stress-related variables in people with mood disorders: The feasibility study,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of a VR-based stress management program on people with mood disorders. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in a tertiary hospital in Singapore, and a convenience sample of 22 was recruited. The program comprised three daily 1-hour sessions incorporating psychoeducation and VR-based relaxation practice. Participants who completed the program had significantly lowered subjective stress (t. =. 6.91, p. <. 0.001), depression (t. =. 5.62, p. <. 0.001), and anxiety (t. =. 5.54, p. <. 0.001); and increased skin temperature (F. =. 17.71, p. <. 0.001), perceived relaxation (F. =. 26.20, p. <. 0.001) and knowledge (F. =. 13.77, p. <. 0.001). Participants' feedback on the program was positive. Findings from this study contribute to improving clinical practice and serve as preliminary data to conduct more rigorous research in the future.

1608,Reflecting peer-support groups in the prevention of stress and burnout: randomized controlled trial,"Aim. This paper is a report of a study to test the effect of participating in a reflecting peer-support group on self-reported health, burnout and on perceived changes in work conditions.Background. Stress-related conditions are one of the most common causes for long-term sick-leave. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of person-directed interventions aimed at reducing stress levels in healthcare workers. Prior research in the relationship between support and burnout show somewhat inconsistent results.Method. A randomized controlled trial with peer-support groups as the intervention was conducted with 660 healthcare workers scoring above the 75th percentile on the exhaustion dimension of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. One hundred and fifty-one (22.9%) agreed to participate. The intervention started in 2002 with 51 participants (96.1% were women), 80 of whom constituted the control group. Potential differences in outcome measures 12 months after the intervention were compared using ancova, and data collected was completed in 2004. Qualitative content analyses were used to analyse reported experiences from group participation.Results. Statistically significant intervention effects were found for general health, perceived quantitative demands at work, participation and development opportunities at work and in support at work. Seven categories of experiences from participating were identified: talking to others in a similar situation, knowledge, sense of belonging, self-confidence, structure, relief of symptoms and behavioural change.Conclusion. Peer-support groups using a problem-based method could be a useful and comparatively inexpensive tool in alleviating work-related stress and burnout.","Peterson, Ulla; Bergstrom, Gunnar; Samuelsson, Mats; Asberg, Marie; Nygren, Ake",0,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04743.x,1231

1612,Randomized controlled trial of computerized cognitive behavioural therapy for depressive symptoms: Effectiveness and costs of a workplace intervention,"Background Depression and anxiety are major causes of absence from work and underperformance in the workplace. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be effective in treating such problems and online versions offer many practical advantages. The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of a computerized CBT intervention (MoodGYM) in a workplace context. Method The study was a phase III two-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial whose main outcome was total score on the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). Depression, anxiety, psychological functioning, costs and acceptability of the online process were also measured. Most data were collected online for 637 participants at baseline, 359 at 6 weeks marking the end of the intervention and 251 participants at 12 weeks post-baseline. Results In both experimental and control groups depression scores improved over 6 weeks but attrition was high. There was no evidence for a difference in the average treatment effect of MoodGYM on the WSAS, nor for a difference in any of the secondary outcomes. Conclusions This study found no evidence that MoodGYM was superior to informational websites in terms of psychological outcomes or service use, although improvement to subthreshold levels of depression was seen in nearly half the patients in both groups.

1613,A recipe for good mental health: A pilot randomised controlled trial of a psychological wellbeing and substance use intervention targeting young chefs,"Aims: Workforce entry is a key transition period. It offers an ideal, but under-utilised opportunity to implement intervention strategies to prevent mental health and substance use problems among young people. A brief psychological wellbeing and substance use intervention targeting a high-risk group - apprentice chefs - was undertaken to explore this opportunity. Method: A RCT design (N = 71) was used. The intervention group received two face-to-face sessions, and controls received five related information sheets during the first 2 weeks of training, with 4-month follow-up. Results: These apprentices were a high-risk group for alcohol and other drug harm and poor psychological wellbeing. At T1, 70% of the participants had AUDIT scores indicating problem drinking; 28% had used cannabis and 18% had used amphetamines in the last 12 months; and 24% had high K10 scores. At T2, the intervention group had significantly reduced risky alcohol use (p = 0.008), improved psychological distress (p = 0.045) and ability to talk with supervisors about work issues (p = 0.001) and cope with work stress (p = 0.001) and verbal abuse (p = 0.005), compared to the control group. Conclusions: Brief tailored interventions, delivered in an occupational training environment, have potential to reduce substance use risk and enhance young workers' psychological wellbeing.","Pidd, Ken; Roche, Ann; Fischer, Jane",1,10.3109/09687637.2015.1016400,1235
1614,The effect of stress management program using cognitive behavior approach on mental health of the mothers of the children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is one of the most common psychiatric disorders in children. Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of stress management program using cognitive behavior approach on mental health of the mothers of the children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Patients and Methods: In this interventional study, 90 mothers of the children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were randomly allocated into three intervention, placebo, and control groups. The general health questionnaire was used to measure mental health. Besides, stress was assessed through the depression-anxiety-stress scale. The two instruments were completed at baseline, immediately after, and one month after the intervention by the mothers. Afterwards, within group comparisons were made using one-sample repeated measurement ANOVA. One-way ANOVA was used for inter group comparisons. Mothers in the placebo group only participated in meetings to talk and express feelings without receiving any interventions. Results: At the baseline, no significant difference was found among the three groups regarding the means of stress, anxiety, depression, and mental health. However, a significant difference was observed in the mean score of stress immediately after the intervention (P = 0.033). The results also showed a significant difference among the three groups regarding the mean score of mental health (P < 0.001). One month after the intervention, the mean difference of mental health score remained significant only in the intervention group (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The study findings confirmed the effectiveness of stress management program utilizing cognitive behavior approach in mental health of the mothers of the children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

1615,Gait Retraining and Incidence of Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome in Army Recruits,"Purpose: Gait retraining, comprising biofeedback and/or an exercise intervention, might reduce the risk of musculoskeletal conditions. The purpose was to examine the effect of a gait-retraining program on medial tibial stress syndrome incidence during a 26-wk basic military training regimen. Methods: A total of 450 British Army recruits volunteered. On the basis of a baseline plantar pressure variable (mean foot balance during the first 10% of stance), participants classified as at risk of developing medial tibial stress syndrome (n = 166) were randomly allocated to an intervention (n = 83) or control (n = 83) group. The intervention involved supervised gait retraining, including exercises to increase neuromuscular control and flexibility (three sessions per week) and biofeedback enabling internalization of the foot balance variable (one session per week). Both groups continued with the usual military training regimen. Diagnoses of medial tibial stress syndrome over the 26-wk regimen were made by physicians blinded to the group assignment. Data were modeled in a survival analysis using Cox regression, adjusting for baseline foot balance and time to peak heel rotation. Results: The intervention was associated with a substantially reduced instantaneous relative risk of medial tibial stress syndrome versus control, with an adjusted HR of 0.25 (95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.53). The number needed to treat to observe one additional injury-free recruit in intervention versus control at 20 wk was 14 (11 to 23) participants. Baseline foot balance was a nonspecific predictor of injury, with an HR per 2 SD increment of 5.2 (1.6 to 53.6). Conclusions: The intervention was effective in reducing incidence of medial tibial stress syndrome in an at-risk military sample.","Sharma, Jagannath; Weston, Matthew; Batterham, Alan M.; Spears, Iain R.",0,10.1249/MSS.0000000000000290,1237
1616,DETERMINANTS OF COSTS AND PAIN IMPROVEMENT FOR MEDICAL AND CHIROPRACTIC CARE OF Low BACK PAIN,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify short-term and long-term determinants of costs and pain improvement for care of low back pain (LBP) provided by medical doctors (MDs) and chiropractors (DCs).Methods: Determinants of office-based costs and pain improvement were modeled for 2872 patients with primary complaint of acute or chronic LBP of mechanical origin enrolled from practices of 111 MDs and 60 DCs using multiple regression analysis. The independent variables were baseline pain intensity (10 cm visual analog scale), chronicity (current episode > or <7 weeks), referred pain above/below the knee, history of LBP, physical health, depression screen, comorbidity, and stress index; age, sex, married, and smoker; pay variables including out-of-pocket, health insurance, auto insurance, Workers' Compensation, and Oregon Health Plan/Medicaid; and a choice of provider indicator based on relative confidence in DC and MD care.Results: Determinants of increased office-based costs for MD care were Workers' Compensation, pain below the knee, and chronic LBP with comorbidity. Predictors of increased cost for DC care were Workers' Compensation, auto and health insurance, LBP chronicity, and baseline pain. Predictors of decreased DC cost were Medicaid and better physical health. Pain improvement was predicted consistently across groups by baseline pain, pain radiating below the knee, physical health, LBP chronicity, and chronicity by baseline pain interaction. There was also a large chronicity by comorbidity interaction at 12 months for both provider types.Conclusions: Cost predictors were driven by insurance type and pain improvement was driven by LBP complaint characteristics.

1617,Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Intensive Multidisciplinary Intervention for Pediatric Feeding Disorders: How Standard Is the Standard of Care?,"Objective To assess models of care and conduct a meta-analysis of program outcomes for children receiving intensive, multidisciplinary intervention for pediatric feeding disorders.Study design We searched Medline, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases (2000-2015) in peer-reviewed journals for studies that examined the treatment of children with chronic food refusal receiving intervention at day treatment or inpatient hospital programs. Inclusion criteria required the presentation of quantitative data on food consumption, feeding behavior, and/or growth status before and after intervention. Effect size estimates were calculated based on a meta-analysis of proportions.Results The systematic search yielded 11 studies involving 593 patients. Nine articles presented outcomes based on retrospective (nonrandomized) chart reviews; 2 studies involved randomized controlled trials. All samples involved children with complex medical and/or developmental histories who displayed persistent feeding concerns requiring formula supplementation. Behavioral intervention and tube weaning represented the most common treatment approaches. Core disciplines overseeing care included psychology, nutrition, medicine, and speechlanguage pathology/occupational therapy. The overall effect size for percentage of patients successfully weaned from tube feeding was 71% (95% CI 54%-83%). Treatment gains endured following discharge, with 80% of patients (95% CI 66%-89%) weaned from tube feeding at last follow-up. Treatment also was associated with increased oral intake, improved mealtime behaviors, and reduced parenting stress.Conclusions Results indicate intensive, multidisciplinary treatment holds benefits for children with severe feeding difficulties. Future research must address key methodological limitations to the extant literature, including improved measurement, more comprehensive case definitions, and standardization/examination of treatment approach.","Sharp, William G.; Volkert, Valerie M.; Scahill, Lawrence; McCracken, Courtney E.; McElhanon, Barbara",0,10.1016/j.jpeds.2016.10.002,1239
1618,Psychometric validation of the dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX),"This study reported on the validation of the psychometric properties, the factorability, validity, and sensitivity of the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX) in 3 clinical and nonclinical samples. A mixed sample of 997 participants-community (n = 663), psychiatric (depressed [n = 92] and anxious [n = 122]), and neurologically impaired (n = 120)-completed self-report questionnaires assessing executive dysfunction, depression, anxiety, stress, general self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life. Before analyses the data were randomly split into 2 subsets (A and B). Exploratory factor analysis performed on Subset A produced a 3-factor model (Factor 1: Inhibition, Factor 2: Volition, and Factor 3: Social Regulation) in which 15 of the original 20 items provided a revised factor structure that was superior to all other structures. A series of confirmatory factor analyses performed on Subset B confirmed that this revised factor structure was valid and reliable. The revised structure, labeled the DEX-R, was found to be a reliable and valid tool for assessing behavioral symptoms of dysexecutive functioning in mixed community, psychiatric, and neurological samples.

1621,Parentsâ€™ assessments of their child's autism-related interventions,"Background: Interventions for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are typically evaluated on the basis of symptom-focused outcome measures. These measures tend to be clinician rated and derived in clinical studies, whilst broader parental experiences are often neglected. Method: Here we report a study of 585 parents of children diagnosed with ASD, focusing on their assessments of their child's ASD Interventions, and how they are perceived to impact parental stress. Results: Overall, high proportions of parents reported disengagement with treatment. The highest completion rates were evident with speech-language therapy, and the lowest with intensive applied behaviour analysis (iABA). However, parents reported the highest expectations, satisfaction and stress reduction with iABA. These paradoxical findings are perhaps due to the relative cost and lack of funding directed towards iABA. Conclusions: Our research suggests that parental expectations and the factors influencing them are worthy of further investigation. More pertinently, parental ratings of intervention effectiveness along with current intervention engagement are a vital and often overlooked component of understanding the effects of interventions on children with ASD and their families.

Participants were individuals reporting stress levels at least 1 SD above the mean on the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983). The RSA group had significantly reduced HR compared to the control group at postintervention and Stressor 2. Both groups significantly improved Stroop scores. Together, these preliminary results suggest that brief relaxation training can reduce state anxiety but that RSA biofeedback appears to have added benefits in reducing state anxiety and HR stress reactivity compared to passive relaxation techniques.

Study formula was infants' sole item of diet for 14 days. Infants' caregivers completed measures of infant behavior and caregivers' distress for the week preceding baseline and again for the week preceding the 14-day follow-up.Results:Infants who received LF milk or LF soy-based formulas did not significantly differ from those who received milk-based, lactose-containing formula on follow-up caregiver-reported measures of infant difficultness from the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire, F(2, 277)=0.83, nor on measures of caregivers' distress, assessed with measures of caregivers' mental health and parenting efficacy, F(2, 285)=0.73-1.07. Across the 3 formula groups, scores on outcome measures significantly improved from baseline to follow-up (P<0.001).Conclusions:Our study does not support LF milk or LF soy-based formulas to alleviate common infant behaviors such as fussiness, crying, or need for attention. Moreover, the data suggest that some difficulties in infant behaviors, as well as caregivers' distress and perceived efficacy in parenting difficult infants, may improve within a couple weeks of reporting difficulties to the pediatrician.","Sherman, Amanda L.; Anderson, Julia; Rudolph, Colin D.; Walker, Lynn S.",0,10.1097/MPG.0000000000000743,1243

Background: Despite the nursing shortage, evidencebased workplace approaches addressing nurse stress have not been well studied. Methods: Nurse leaders (n = 33) were randomly assigned to brief mindfulness meditation course (MMC) or leadership course (control). Self-report measures of stress were administered at baseline and within 1 week of course completion. Results: Among MMC participants, change scores (from baseline to postintervention) on several subscales of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised showed significantly more improvement in self-reported stress symptoms relative to controls. Mindfulness meditation course participants had significantly more improvement in Positive Symptom Distress Index (P = 0.010; confidence interval [CI] = j0.483 to j0.073) and Global Severity Index (P = 0.019; CI = j0.475 to j0.046) and nearly significantly more improvement in Positive Symptom Total (P = 0.066; CI = j16.66 to 0.581) compared with controls.

The evaluation was designed to assess the impact of program on the contact coverage of evidence-based treatments for depression and AUD through a repeated survey design. This paper describes the baseline prevalence of depression among adults in rural community, association of various demographic and socio-economic factors with depression and estimates contact coverage and costs of care for depression. Methods: Population-based cross-sectional survey of adults in 30 villages of Amravati district in Vidarbha region of Central India. The outcome of interest was a probable diagnosis of depression which was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Data were analyzed using simple and multiple logistic regression. Results: The outcome of current depression (PHQ-9Â â‰¥Â 10) was observed in 14.6Â % of the sample (95Â % CI 12.8â€“16.4Â %). The contact coverage for current depression was only 4.3Â % (95Â % CI 1.5â€“7.1Â %). Prevalence of depression varied greatly between the two sites of the study; higher age, female gender, lower education, economic status below poverty line and indebtedness were associated with depression; and while a contact coverage with formal health care was very low, a large proportion of affected persons had consulted family members. Conclusions: Our findings clearly indicate that psycho-social distress in rural communities in Maharashtra is strongly associated with social determinants such as gender, poverty and indebtedness and affects the entire population and not just farmers.

The intervention consisted of two group sessions performed in the workplace aiming to reduce stress, increase knowledge about hypertension, and explore the effect on illness perception. The sessions included clinical aspects of systemic arterial hypertension, illness perception and health behavior, and strategies for stress management. Workers from a petrochemical industry (19 hypertensive and 14 normotensive) participated in the study by answering a biosociodemographic questionnaire, the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, the Perceived Stress Scale, and a quiz with questions about hypertension. The measurements were collected at an initial meeting to gather the participants and 90 days after the intervention. There was a significant reduction in the perceived stress levels of both groups, in addition to an increase in the perception of personal control and illness coherence. Normotensive workers also increased their knowledge about hypertension, while hypertensive patients increased the perception that treatment could control the illness. In conclusion, the pilot intervention generated positive effects and can be considered a strategy of illness prevention for normotensive workers and control for hypertensive patients.

1627,A transdiagnostic investigation of emotional distress after traumatic brain injury,"Emotional distress after traumatic brain injury (TBI) often presents as a range of neurobehavioural and emotional reactions rather than distinct disorders. This study adopted a transdiagnostic approach with the aim of identifying psychological processes common to depression, anxiety and global distress after TBI. Fifty participants with TBI (aged 19-66 years, 12-65 months post-injury) completed measures of threat appraisals and avoidance behaviour (Appraisal of Threat and Avoidance Questionnaire), self-discrepancy (Head Injury Semantic Differential Scale III), emotion dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale), worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), negative self-focused attention (Self-Focus Sentence Completion) and emotional distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and Brief Symptom Inventory). Significant correlations were found among the proposed transdiagnostic variables (rs =.29-.82, p <.05). A principal components analysis revealed two underlying factors: (1) Threats to Self, and (2) Emotion Dysregulation. Only the Emotion Dysregulation factor accounted for significant unique variance in levels of depression, anxiety and global distress (sr2 =.12-.17). Such findings indicate the need for interventions to target difficulties in identifying and regulating emotions after TBI to facilitate emotional adjustment.

1628,"The relationships among taiwanese adolescents' perceived classroom environment, academic coping, and burnout","Although academic pressures are regarded as a primary source of stress among students in Asian countries, there has been paucity of research on the effects of classroom settings providing structure and peer support on Asian adolescents' use of coping strategies and academic burnout. The present study was intended to address this issue. Three hundred seventy-four 8th Grade Taiwanese students completed a self-reported survey that assessed their perceived classroom structure along with peer support, academic coping, and burnout. Results of structural equation modeling indicated that the full mediation model was well supported by the empirical data. Students' use of coping strategies played a mediational role in relationships between perceived classroom environment and academic burnout. Perceived classroom structure and peer support impact students' choices of coping strategies significantly. Their use of academic coping, in turn, exerted significant influences on burnout experiences. Additionally, students' academic coping and burnout experiences varied with different levels of perceived classroom structure and peer support. Students who perceived higher levels of classroom structure and peer support tend to adopt engagement and support-seeking coping when faced with academic challenges. Moreover, these students displayed lower levels on the indicators of academic burnout. Â© 2014 American Psychological Association.",Shih S.-S.,0,10.1037/spq0000093,1248
1629,Influence of background music on work attention in clients with chronic schizophrenia,"BACKGROUND: Work attention in persons with chronic schizophrenia is an important issue in vocational rehabilitation. Some of the research literature indicates that background music may influence visual attention performance.OBJECTIVES: Based on the theory of occupational therapy, environmental sounds, colors and decorations may affect individual performance, this study thus examined the influence of music on work attention in persons with schizophrenia.PARTICIPANTS: Participants were recruited from a halfway house in Taipei. Forty-nine (49) patients with chronic schizophrenia volunteered. They had been accepted into vocational rehabilitation and a work-seeking program. The sample included 20 females and 29 males. The participant ages ranged between 29 and 63 years old, and their average age was 47 years old.METHODS: Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study, the participants were assigned to one of three conditions: quiet environment as the control group (n = 16), classical light music as background music (n = 16), and popular music as background music (n = 17).RESULTS: For Group 1 (control group/quiet environment), there was no significant variance (sig = 0.172). For Group 2 (Classical light music), the intervention revealed significant variance (sig = 0.071*). For Group 3 (popular music), the intervention had significant variance (sig = 0.048**).CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of background music tended to increase attention test scores of persons with schizophrenia.

1630,A Systematic Review of Stress-Management Programs for Medical Students,"Objective: Because medical students experience a considerable amount of stress during training, academic leaders have recognized the importance of developing stress-management programs for medical students. The authors set out to identify all controlled trials of stress-management interventions and determine the efficacy of those interventions. Method: The authors searched the published English-language articles on PsycINFO and PubMed, using a combination of the following search terms: stress-management, distress, burnout, coping, medical student, wellness. Both randomized, controlled trials and controlled, non-randomized trials of stress-management programs were selected and critically appraised. Results: A total of 13 randomized, controlled trials or controlled, non-randomized trials were identified. Interventions included self-hypnosis, meditation, mindfulness-based stress-reduction, feedback on various health habits, educational discussion, changes in the length and type of curriculum, and changes in the grading system. Only one study was identified to be of very high quality, although several had described group differences at baseline, used blinding, had good follow-up, and used validated assessment tools. There was a wide heterogeneity of outcome measures used. Interventions that were supported by a reduction in stress and anxiety in medical students included mindfulness-based stress-reduction or meditation techniques, self-hypnosis, and pass/fail grading. Conclusions: Significant opportunities to advance educational research in this field exist by developing more high-quality studies with particular attention to randomization techniques and standardizing outcome measures.","Shiralkar, MT; Harris, TB; Eddins-Folensbee, FF; Coverdale, JH",0,10.1176/appi.ap.12010003,1250
1631,A Multidisciplinary Workplace Intervention for Chronic Low Back Pain among Nursing Assistants in Iran,"Study Design: Interventional research with a 6-month follow-up period.Purpose: We aimed to establish the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary workplace intervention on reduction of work-related low back pain (WRLBP), using ergonomic posture training coupled with an educational program based on social cognitive theory. Overview of Literature: WRLBP is a major occupational problem among healthcare workers, who are often required to lift heavy loads. Patient handling is a particular requirement of nurse aides, and has been reported as the main cause of chronic WRLBP. Methods: We included 125 nursing assistants from two hospitals affiliated to Qom University of Medical Sciences from May to December 2015. There was an intervention hospital with a number of 63 nursing assistants who received four multidisciplinary educational sessions for 2 hours each plus ergonomic posture training over two days and a control hospital with a number of 62 nursing assistants who didn't receive educational intervention about low back pain. The outcomes of interest were reductions in WRLBP intensity and disability from baseline to the follow up at 6 months, which were measured using a visual analog scale and the Quebec Disability Scale. Descriptive and analytical statistics were used to analyze the data. Results: The comparison tests showed significant change from baseline in reduction of WRLBP intensity following the multidisciplinary program, with scores of 5.01 +/- 1.97 to 3.42 +/- 2.53 after 6 months on the visual analog scale in the intervention group (p<0.001) and no significant change in control groups. There was no significant difference in the disability scores between the two groups (p=0.07).Conclusions: We showed that our multidisciplinary intervention could reduce the intensity of WRLBP among","Shojaei, Sarallah; Tavafian, Sedigheh Sadat; Jamshidi, Ahmad Reza; Wagner, Joan",0,10.4184/asj.2017.11.3.419,1251

1635,"Factors associated with Maternal depressive symptoms among lowincome, African American smokers enrolled In a secondhand smoke reduction programme","Introduction Maternal depressive symptoms increase the risk of poor maternal and child health outcomes, and are a primary barrier to health behaviour change. Social cognitive theory can guide our understanding of risk factors that may have an impact on maternal depressive symptoms. The aim of this paper was to understand the correlates of maternal depressive symptoms among low-income African American smokers completing a 16-week intervention trial to reduce young children's second-hand smoke exposure (SHSe). Methods This study presents a secondary analysis of depression symptoms among 227 maternal smokers completing the SHSe-reduction trial. The end-of-treatment Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score was used to assess depressive symptoms (dichotomised as 0 = score of < 16 and 1 = score of â‰¥ 16). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to test the one-way hypothesis that odds of significant depressive symptoms would be associated with greater total number of household smokers, greater number of paediatric sick visits, greater daily exposure of child to cigarette smoke by their mother, greater life-event stress, and lower social support, marital status, employment status and level of educational attainment. Results Number of household smokers (OR = 1.57, P = 0.049), social support (OR = 0.88, P<0.001) and life-event stress (OR = 1.04, P = 0.001) predicted significant maternal depressive symptoms; all other variables were not significant predictors in the model. Conclusion Number of household smokers is a novel risk factor for understanding significant maternal depressive symptoms in the context of a childhood SHSe-reduction trial. Improving our understanding of the household-level social milieu in the context of SHSe-reduction interventions will assist in reducing the risk of maternal depressive symptoms.

1636,The effects of heart rate variability biofeedback in patients with preterm labour,"Preterm birth is a highly prevalent phenomenon that was shown to be associated with mental stress during pregnancy (Rich-Edwards and Grizzard in Am J Obstet Gynecol 192(5 Suppl):S30-S35, 2005). We aimed to assess the effects of heart rate variability (HRV)-biofeedback in patients with preterm labour. Therefore, we conducted a controlled randomized parallel group study in 48 female patients aged 19-38 years (median = 29) with preterm labour at gestational week 24th-32nd (median = 29th). In this study, one group (n = 24) attended six sessions of HRV-biofeedback over 2 weeks whereas patients of the other group (n = 24) were assigned to control sessions. In the HRV-biofeedback treated group, perception of chronic stress was decreased 4 weeks after completion of training compared to baseline (p < 0.05) but there was no change in the control group. In the HRV-biofeedback group, preterm birth was seen in 3 patients (13 %) whereas in the control group, preterm delivery occurred in 8 patients (33 %, p = n.s.). There was no difference in birth weight between groups and HRV remained unchanged. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that HRV-biofeedback can reduce chronic stress in patients with preterm labour when administered as an adjunct to routine care. However, it remains unclear whether stress reduction through HRV-biofeedback has a beneficial effect on preterm birth.

1637,Predictors for chronic neck and low back pain in office workers: a 1-year prospective cohort study,"Objective: All occupations expose workers to varied and unique conditions. The nature of work has been recognized as influencing the health of workers. Whether predictors for chronic neck and low back pain would be occupation-specific is unknown. This study aimed to identify predictors for chronic neck and low back pain in a cohort of office workers. Methods: A prospective study was carried out among 669 healthy office workers. At baseline, risk factors were assessed using a questionnaire and standardized physical examination. A symptomatic case was defined as an individual who reported pain greater than 30 mm on a 100-mm VAS, and chronic pain was defined as experiencing ongoing neck or low back pain for greater than 3 months over the past 6 months. Two regression models were built to analyze the risk factors for developing chronic neck and low back pain. Results: Of the sample, 17 and 27% of office workers who reported a new onset of neck or low back pain developed chronicity, respectively. Predictors for chronic neck pain were high body mass index, frequent neck extension during the work day, high initial pain intensity, and high psychological job demands. The development of chronic low back pain was associated with history of low back pain and high initial pain intensity. Conclusions: The findings suggest that predictors for chronic musculoskeletal pain in a subpopulation may be a subset of predictors identified in a general population or occupation specific. Successful management to prevent chronic musculoskeletal pain may also need to consider the patient's occupation.","Sihawong, Rattaporn; Sitthipornvorakul, Ekalak; Paksaichol, Arpalak; Janwantanakul, Prawit",0,10.1539/joh.15-0168-OA,1257
1638,"Longitudinal change in the use of services in autism spectrum disorder: Understanding the role of child characteristics, family demographics, and parent cognitions","The aim of this study was to identify child characteristics, family demographics, and parent cognitions that may affect access to early intervention, special education, and related services. The sample included 70 families of young children with autism spectrum disorders. All parents were enrolled in a short education program, providing them with basic information and resources on advocating for a young child with autism spectrum disorders (Parent Advocacy Coaching). Longitudinal change in children's intervention program in the community was evaluated over a period of about 27 months, starting 12 months prior to enrollment in Parent Advocacy Coaching. Results revealed large individual differences in the intensity of children's individual and school-based services. Despite this variability, only two child characteristics (age, gender) emerged as independent predictors. In contrast, the intensity of children's intervention programs was independently predicted by a broad range of demographic characteristics, including parental education, child ethnicity and race, and family composition. Finally, even after child characteristics and family demographics were statistically controlled, results revealed associations between specific parental cognitions (parenting efficacy, understanding of child development) and the subsequent rate of change in the intensity of children's intervention programs. Implications for improving educational programs that aim to enhance parent advocacy are discussed.

As a measure of parenting stress specific to core and co-morbid symptoms of autism, the APSI is unique. It is intended for use by clinicians to identify areas where parents need support with parenting skills, and to assess the effect of intervention on parenting stress. Mean parenting stress in the autism group was four times that of the typical group and double that of the other developmental delay group [F(2,272) = 153; p < 001]. An exploratory factor analysis suggested three factors impacting parenting stress: one relating to core deficits, one to co-morbid behavioral symptoms, and one to co-morbid physical symptoms.

1640,Contribution of Perceived Cognitive Functioning to Quality of Life in Service Members and Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Perceived cognitive impairment is a core clinical feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and may be an important determinant of quality of life (QOL) in those who suffer from this disorder. Using a clinical data repository, we evaluated this hypothesis in a cross-sectional sample of U.S. military service members and veterans who served after September 11, 2001, and were seeking mental health treatment at a tertiary outpatient clinic. A consecutive series of 117 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PTSD completed a battery of questionnaires at intake, including the PTSD Checklist (Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993), a 4-item Cognitive Symptom subscale of the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory (Cicerone & Kalmar, 1995), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995), and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Endicott, Nee, Harrison, & Blumenthal, 1993). Cognitive symptom reporting was very high, even in the subgroup without a history of traumatic brain injury. In a regression analysis, cognitive symptom severity was independently associated with QOL (Î² = âˆ’.204). This relationship was not explained by comorbid traumatic brain injury, but was restricted to patients with comorbid depression (Î² = âˆ’.278 in the subgroup with an elevated Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 Depression subscale; n = 91). In conclusion, perceived cognitive impairment was common in this PTSD sample and helped to explain impairments in QOL, especially in patients with comorbid depression.

Results showed that over two-thirds of the sample reported satisfaction, which was associated with low parenting stress, increased use of positive and decreased use of negative dyadic coping strategies. Positive dyadic coping was found to have a greater influence than negative dyadic coping, supporting a strengths-based approach to interventions promoting family resilience.

1643,"An evidence-based stress management intervention for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant caregivers: development, feasibility and acceptability","Purpose: Caregivers of cancer patients face challenges impacting their physical, psychological and social well-being that need attention in the form of well-designed and tested interventions. We created an eight-session individual stress management intervention for caregivers of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (Allo-HSCT) recipients. This intervention, tested by randomized control trial, proved effective in decreasing distress. Herein, we describe the intervention including theoretical framework, development, and elements of fidelity. Implementation challenges along with recommendations for refinement in future studies are discussed with the goal of replication and dissemination. Methods: Seventy-four of 148 caregivers received stress management training following randomization. The intervention occurred during the 100-day post-transplant period when caregivers are required. The training provided integrated cognitive behavioral strategies, psychoeducation, and problem-solving skills building as well as use of a biofeedback device. Results: Seventy percent of caregivers completed all eight sessions indicating good acceptability for the in-person intervention; however, most caregivers did not reliably use the biofeedback device. The most common reason for drop-out was their patient becoming gravely ill or patient death. Few caregivers dropped out because of study demands. The need for flexibility in providing intervention sessions was key to retention. Conclusion: Our evidence-based stress management intervention for Allo-HSCT caregivers was feasible. Variability in acceptability and challenges in implementation are discussed and suggestions for refinement of the intervention are outlined. Dissemination efforts could improve by using alternative methods for providing caregiver support such as telephone or video chat to accommodate caregivers who are unable to attend in-person sessions.

1645,Suicidality and Suicide Prevention Among War Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common injury sustained by soldiers in war, with rates ranging from 14 to 20% among wounded veterans from both 20(th) and 21(st) century conflicts. To date little is known about the frequency of lethal and nonlethal suicidal behaviours among these veterans. In the only suicide prevalence estimate to date, World War 2 veterans with TB! from Finland had a suicide rate ranging between 70-80 per 100,000, double the rate for the general Finnish population. Turning to suicide risk factors, research to date suggests that factors including sex, injury severity, post-injury psychiatric morbidity and occupational status may modulate the level of suicide risk among veterans with TBI. Suicide prevention efforts can be organised hierarchically, to focus at three levels: Universal interventions (such as suicide screening) that target all veterans with TBI; Selected interventions (such as pharmacotherapy) that target veterans in at-risk groups (e.g., depressed veterans); and Indicated interventions (such as crisis intervention) that target veterans who have displayed suicidal behaviour. The future challenge is to combine research and clinical practice efforts to reduce the overall levels of suicide.","Simpson, Grahame; Tate, Robyn",0,,1264

This study was designed to compare the initial efficacy of Motivational Interviewing (MI), Online Transtheoretical Model (TTM)tailored communications and a brief Health Risk Intervention (HRI) on four health risk factors (inactivity, BMI, stress and smoking) in a worksite sample.Method. A randomized clinical trial assigned employees to one of three recruitment strategies and one of the three treatments. The treatment protocol included an HRI session for everyone and in addition either a recommended three TTM online sessions or three MI in person or telephone sessions over 6 months. At the initial post-treatment assessment at 6 months, groups were compared on the percentage who had progressed from at risk to taking effective action on each of the four risks.Results. Compared to the HRI only group, the MI and TTM groups had significantly more participants in the Action stage for exercise and effective stress management and significantly fewer risk behaviors at 6 months. MI and TTM group outcomes were not different.Conclusion. This was the first study to demonstrate that MI and online TTM could produce significant multiple behavior changes.

1648,Use of a randomized multiple baseline design: Rationale and design of the Spirited Life holistic health intervention study,"Clergy suffer from high rates of obesity, chronic disease, and depression, and simultaneously underestimate the toll these take on their daily functioning. Health interventions are needed for clergy and may be tailored to their occupational context and theological beliefs. Few studies have sought to improve clergy health. No prior studies have utilized a randomized design. Spirited Life is a randomized, multiple baseline study that offered enrollment to nearly all United Methodist Church clergy in North Carolina in fall 2010. A total of 1114 clergy (response rate = 64%) enrolled. Using a multiple baseline design, we randomized participants to three cohorts. Each cohort began the health intervention in one of three consecutive years. The third cohort served as a randomized waitlist control cohort, allowing comparisons between the first and third cohorts. The two-year Spirited Life intervention consists of: 1) a theological underpinning for health stewardship based on incarnation, grace, and response and delivered during workshops; 2) the stress management program Williams LifeSkills; 3) Naturally Slim, an online weight loss program; 4) phone contact with a Wellness Advocate; and 5) $500 small grants for health goals. Metabolic syndrome is the primary endpoint. Stress and depressive severity are secondary endpoints. We measured each construct before, twice during, and at the end of the two-year intervention. Study outcomes, to be published after follow-up data are gathered, will provide evidence of the effectiveness of the combined intervention components of Spirited Life. If successful, the intervention may be considered for use with other clergy and faith populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Proeschold-Bell, Rae Jean; Swift, Robin; Moore, H.

1649,Effectiveness of caregiver training in Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) vs. Training-as-Usual (TAU): A randomized controlled trial,"Caregivers of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) often end up having their medical and psychological well-being compromised due to the stressful nature of caregiving, especially when those in their care engage in aggressive behavior. In this study, we provided caregivers with mindfulness-based training to enable them to better manage their psychological well-being and, through this, to also enhance specific indices of quality of life of the individuals in their care. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) the comparative effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) and Training-as-Usual (TAU) for caregivers in a congregate care facility for individuals with severe and profound IDD. The comparative effects of the two training conditions were assessed in terms of caregiver variables care recipient variable (number of aggressive events), and agency variables Results showed that MBPBS was significantly more effective than TAU in enabling the caregivers to manage their perceived psychological stress, and to reduce the use of physical restraints and stat medications for aggressive behavior of the individuals in their care. In addition, there were significant reductions in aggressive events by the individuals in their care, 1:1 staffing of individuals with aggressive behavior, and staff turnover. Furthermore, the MBPBS training was significantly more cost-effective than the TAU training. If replicated in future RCT studies, MBPBS may provide an effective means of enhancing socially acceptable bidirectional engagement of caregivers and care recipients within a person-centered context.

Treatment for these disorders is limited in low- and middle-income countries. This systematic review synthesizes the implementation processes and examines the effectiveness of psychological treatments for common mental disorders in adults delivered by nonspecialist providers in low- and middle-income countries. In total, 27 trials met the eligibility criteria; most treatments targeted depression or posttraumatic stress. Treatments were commonly delivered by community health workers or peers in primary care or community settings; they usually were delivered with fewer than 10 sessions over 2-3 months in an individual, face-to-face format. Treatments included common elements, such as nonspecific engagement and specific domains of behavioral, interpersonal, emotional, and cognitive elements. The pooled effect size was 0.49 (95% confidence interval = 0.36-0.62), favoring intervention conditions. Our review demonstrates that psychological treatments-comprising a parsimonious set of common elements and delivered by a low-cost, widely available human resource-have moderate to strong effects in reducing the burden of common mental disorders.

1653,"An integrative model of autism spectrum disorder: ASD as a neurobiological disorder of experienced environmental deprivation, early life stress and allostatic overload","A number of recent convergences within neurobiology, and between neurobiology and psychoanalysis, allow us to view autism through a new lens. This perspective highlights biological risk factors that might operate through final common pathways to produce the ASD syndrome. The goal of this article is to integrate and elaborate upon this confluence of findings, and to develop a working model of ASD that could parsimoniously account for central aspects of ASD, promote greater collaboration in research, and lead to more effective treatment. Converging evidence suggests that ASD is a potentially reversible neurodevelopmental disorder in which neurobiological factors - not poor parenting - interfere with the child-caregiver interaction. The infant then experiences deprivation of growth-promoting parental input even though it is available. The model proposed here adds what seems to have been largely unrecognized in the field of autism: the child's experience of social deprivation and isolation signals threat to the child and may result in overwhelming stress with significant psychological (traumatic or toxic stress) and biological (allostatic overload) components and consequences. Allostatic overload results when attempts to cope with threat impose too great a burden, resulting in a pathophysiological state or process that damages the body and predisposes one to the development of disease. Critically, this model proposes that allostatic overload plays a major role in the course of ASD by amplifying the neurobiological vulnerabilities generally considered to make primary contributions to the development of autism. Furthermore, through the process of allostatic overload, neurobiological and psychological factors interact in a nonlinear fashion and are both seen to underlie the symptoms of ASD which develop through maladaptive coping and neuroplasticity. Thus, this model might explain both the progression to, and the ongoing symptoms of, the ASD syndrome. In addition, the model could also account for successful intervention by promoting the reversal of this process via adaptive coping and neuroplasticity. Factors that may facilitate adaptive neuroplasticity include providing an enriched environment, increasing social and emotional connection, and decreasing anxiety, stress, and allostatic load. Personal descriptions of the experience of ASD, as well as psychoanalytic clinical work with children with ASD, are in accord with this model. Psychoanalysis may thus be considered a research tool that assists in uncovering the child's inner world of feelings and meanings, an under-appreciated element in autism. Making sense of the child's experience of isolation and threat helps the ASD child feel understood and less afraid. Clinical material will illustrate how, for some children on the higher end of the autism spectrum, recovery is made more likely by increasing the sense of connection and decreasing the experience of stress.

Methods: The stress management programme is based on the concept of Siegrist and Silberhorn (1999), together with preventive components from the Schelp, Gravemeier und Maluck programme (1997). The programme is particularly aimed at (1) reducing excessive control ambitions (Type A Behavior Pattern), (2) changing the expectations of the effects of alcohol consumption (drinking functions), and (3) reducing the alcohol consumption itself. The subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental group or the control group. The control group was offered the stress management training after the follow-up (waiting list condition). The participants answered a questionnaire regarding their control ambitions, their alcohol consumption and their expectations of the effects of alcohol consumption. Results: The acceptance of the programme was high. Follow-up examination after three months showed a significant reduction in control ambitions, their alcohol consumption and their expectations of the effects of alcohol consumption. However, no correlation could be found between the reduction in control ambitions and the reduction in alcohol consumption, so that it remains ultimately unclear by what factors the reduction in alcohol consumption was caused. Conclusions: The participation in workplace stress management programmes with addiction prevention components can lead to an reduction in alcohol consumption.","Puls W., Inhester M.-L., Wienold H.",1,,1271

In a cross-sectional study, we interviewed 952 carers of children (aged 4-13 years) attending 28 randomly selected CBOs funded by 11 major donors in South Africa and Malawi. Psychological morbidity was measured using the Shona Symptom Questionnaire and suicidal ideation was measured using an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire. Carers were asked about care-seeking for emotional problems. Overall, 28% of carers scored above the clinical cut-off for current psychological morbidity and 12.2% reported suicidal ideation. We used logistic regression models to test factors associated with poor outcomes. Household unemployment, living with a sick family member and perceived lack of support from the community were associated with both psychological morbidity and suicidal ideation in carers. Reported child food insecurity was also associated with psychological morbidity. In addition, carers living in South Africa were more likely to present with psychological morbidity and suicidal ideation than carers in Malawi. Rates of help-seeking for mental health problems were low. Carers of children affected by HIV are at risk for mental health problems as a result of HIV, socio-economic, care-giving and community factors. We call for increased recognition of the potential role of CBOs in providing mental health care and support for families as a means to improve equity in mental health care. Specifically, we highlight the need for increased training and supervision of staff at CBOs for children affected by HIV, and the inclusion of CBOs in broader efforts to improve population mental health outcomes.

1658,The Primary Prevention of PTSD: A Systematic Review,"There has been abundant research targeting the secondary and tertiary prevention and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including different forms of debriefing, treatments for acute stress disorder, and targeted intervention strategies (M. T. Feldner, C. M. Monson, & M. J. Friedman, 2007). However, there remains a scarcity of research pertaining to the primary, pretrauma prevention of PTSD. A systematic review was conducted in order to identify and synthesize all programs aimed at the primary prevention of PTSD to date. A broad search strategy was used, yielding 15,014 studies in 4 languages published between 1915 and 2012. Studies in which a resilience-building intervention was delivered prior to a potentially traumatic event, with data collected regarding psychological well-being, were eligible. A total of 7 studies were identified as meeting these criteria. Currently, there is no solid body of research on the primary prevention of PTSD to justify or guide interventions. The limitations and future directions of research in this domain are discussed.

1659,Does emotional support during the luteal phase decrease the stress of in vitro fertilization?,"Objective: To determine if phone calls between ET and pregnancy test, decrease stress levels as determined by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS).Design: Randomized controlled trial.Setting: Academic medical center.Patient(s): Women undergoing a first fresh cycle of assisted reproductive technology using autologous oocytes with a day 2 or 3 ET.Intervention(s): Phone calls from specialized social workers or standard of care.Main Outcome Measure(s): Primary outcome was the change in PSS score from day of ET compared with 10 days after ET; secondary outcome was perceived patient benefit.Result(s): A total of 131 patients were randomized to the intervention (n = 66) or control (n = 65) group. No differences were seen in the final PSS score or the change in PSS score between groups. At the completion of the study, the intervention group was more likely to report that participating in this study was helpful (65.9% vs. 21.4%), as well as to recommend emotional support during an IVF cycle (95.4% vs. 78.6%).Conclusion(s): Although we observed no significant change in PSS score, first-cycle IVF patients felt that increased emotional support was needed during the waiting period between ET and pregnancy test. Additional research should be conducted to determine the best interventions for this time period. (Fertil Steril (R) 2011; 96: 1467-72.

1661,Responding to gender and sexual minority stress with functional analytic psychotherapy,"Despite an overwhelming literature detailing the impact of societal bias on the well-being and relationships of gender and sexual minority clients, as well as greater rates of help-seeking from mental health professionals, recent advances in minority stress research have not been fully incorporated into clinical practice. Minority stress factors such as internalized stigma, rejection sensitivity, and concealment interfere with vulnerable and intimate relationships, and likely contribute to the transdiagnostic challenges that GSM clients report, such as loneliness and social isolation (Mereish & Poteat, 2015). Further, behavioral patterns emphasizing inauthentic self-presentation are common interpersonal styles of stigma management (Pachankis & Hatzenbuehler, 2013). Functional analytic psychotherapy is interpersonal therapy grounded in a behavior analytic approach to the therapeutic relationship, which was developed to promote generalizable change in intimate and vulnerable behaviors with meaningful others (Kohlenberg & Tsai, 1991). Functional analytic psychotherapy emphasizes the role of contingent responding by the therapist to clinically relevant behaviors, to increase vulnerable, interpersonal risks that can be responded to in a warm and compassionate way. FAP is ideal for adaptation to target the interpersonal aspects of minority stress on gender and sexual minority clients that often include histories of punishment in response to vulnerable authenticity, possibly even by past therapists (e.g., Flentje, Heck, & Cochran, 2014; Garnets, Hancock, Cochran, Goodchilds, & Peplau, 1991).

1664,A novel stress and coping workplace program reduces illness and healthcare utilization,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine if a novel workplace stress management program, delivered either face-to-face or by self-help, would reduce illness and health services utilization among participants. Methods: Five hundred one volunteers were randomly allocated to one of three groups: full intervention, which received assessment and personalized self-study feedback and was offered six face-to-face, small-group sessions; partial intervention, a self-help group that received assessment and personalized feedback by mail; and a wait-list control group. All participants completed questionnaires for stress, anxiety, and coping at the start of the study and 6 and 12 months later. Health reports were completed at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. A subsample of subjects who subscribed to a single health maintenance organization provided objectively recorded doctor visit data across the study year. Results: All three groups reported significant improvement in their stress, anxiety, and coping across the year. Full intervention participants showed a more rapid reduction in negative responses to stress than did participants from the other groups. Full-intervention subjects also reported fewer days of illness than subjects in the other groups. Objectively measured physician visits showed a large (34%) reduction in healthcare utilization for full intervention subjects in the HMO subsample. Conclusions: These results indicated that a work-site program that focuses on stress, anxiety, and coping measurement along with small-group educational intervention can significantly reduce illness and healthcare utilization.","Rahe R.H., Taylor C.B., Tolles R.L., Newhall L.M., Veach T.L., Bryson S.",1,10.1097/00006842-200203000-00011,1277
1665,"The concise physical activity Questionnaire (CPAQ): Its development, validation, and application to firefighter occupational health","Physical activity is related to many important benefits in occupational health, but existing measures tend to be too long and involved for organizational application. The aim of this research was to create and construct validate the Concise Physical Activity Questionnaire (CPAQ), a very brief measure of physical activity for use in cross-sectional research. Four items were generated based on past research, Center for Disease Control guidelines, and input from health professionals. Across 2 studies, this scale was examined in both a laboratory and applied setting. In Study 1, 238 students completed the CPAQ, plus physiological and self-report measures relating to health. Results supported construct validity: the CPAQ related negatively to resting heart rate, health problems, BMI, and stress, and positively to gym attendance. In Study 2, 305 firefighters completed survey questionnaires. CPAQ scores related negatively to self-report burnout, and health problems and objective absenteeism measures, providing initial evidence of the CPAQ's usefulness in occupational health research. Suggestions for future research to apply and understand the CPAQ in the workplace are discussed. Â© 2014 American Psychological Association.","Sliter K.A., Sliter M.T.",0,10.1037/a0035638,1278

In this review, the authors discussed human and animal research on psychophysiological mechanisms influencing coronary artery disease and its progression to CHD. They then reviewed literature on personality and characteristics of the social environment as risk factors for CHD. Hostility confers increased risk, and a group of risk factors involving depression and anxiety may be especially important following myocardial infarction. Social isolation, interpersonal conflict, and job stress confer increased risk. Psychosocial interventions may have beneficial effects on CHD morbidity and mortality, although inconsistent results and a variety of methodological limitations preclude firm conclusions.

1669,"Medical and Psychology Studentâ€™s Experiences in Learning Mindfulness: Benefits, Paradoxes, and Pitfalls","Mindfulness has attracted increased interest in the field of health professionalsâ€™ education due to its proposed double benefit of providing self-help strategies to counter stress and burnout symptoms and cultivating attitudes central to the role of professional helpers. The current study explored the experiential aspects of learning mindfulness. Specifically, we explored how first-year medical and psychology students experienced and conceptualized mindfulness upon completion of a 7-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program. Twenty-two students participated in either two focus group interviews or ten in-depth interviews, and we performed an interpretive phenomenological analysis of the interview transcripts. All students reported increased attention and awareness of psychological and bodily phenomena. The majority also reported a shift in their attitudes towards their experiences in terms of decreased reactivity, increased curiosity, affect tolerance, patience and self-acceptance, and improved relational qualities. The experience of mindfulness was mediated by subjective intention and the interpretation of mindfulness training. The attentional elements of mindfulness were easier to grasp than the attitudinal ones, in particular with respect to the complex and inherently paradoxical elements of non-striving and radical acceptance. Some participants considered mindfulness as a means to more efficient instrumental task-oriented coping, whilst others reported increased sensitivity and tolerance towards their own state of mind. A broader range of program benefits appeared dependent upon embracing the paradoxes and integrating attitudinal elements in practising mindfulness. Ways in which culture and context may influence the experiences in learning mindfulness are discussed along with practical, conceptual, and research implications.

1670,PLAY Project Home Consultation Intervention Program for Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the Play and Language for Autistic Youngsters (PLAY) Project Home Consultation model, in combination with usual community services (CS), to improve parent-child interaction, child development, and autism symptomatology in young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) compared with CS only. Methods: Children (N = 128) with autism or PDD-NOS (DSM-4 criteria) aged 2 years 8 months to 5 years 11 months and recruited from 5 disability agencies in 4 US states were randomized in two 1-year cohorts. Using videotape and written feedback within a developmental framework, PLAY consultants coached caregivers monthly for 12 months to improve caregiver-child interaction. CS included speech/language and occupational therapy and public education services. Primary outcomes included change in parent-child interactions, language and development, and autism-related diagnostic category/symptoms. Secondary outcomes included parent stress and depression and home consultant fidelity. Data were collected pre- and post-intervention. Results: Using intent-to-treat analysis (ITT), large treatment effects were evident for parent and child interactional behaviors on the Maternal and Child Behavior Rating Scales. Child language and developmental quotient did not differ over time by group, although functional development improved significantly. PLAY children improved in diagnostic categories on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). PLAY caregivers' stress did not increase, and depressive symptomatology decreased. Home consultants administered the intervention with fidelity. Conclusions: PLAY intervention demonstrated substantial changes in parent-child interaction without increasing parents' stress/depression. ADOS findings must be interpreted cautiously because results do not align with clinical experience. PLAY offers communities a relatively inexpensive effective intervention for children with ASD and their parents.","Solomon, Richard; Van Egeren, Laurie A.; Mahoney, Gerald; Huber, Melissa S.

Empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness in improving well-being is lacking. In a randomized controlled trial, the effects of CFT as guided self-help on well-being were evaluated. Method: Adults (mean age = 52.87, SD = 9.99, 74.8% female) with low to moderate levels of well-being were recruited in the Dutch population and randomized to CFT (n = 120) or a waitlist control group (n = 122). Participants completed the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (well-being), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (depression and anxiety), Perceived Stress Scale (stress), Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form (self-compassion), Forms of Self-Criticizing/Attacking and Reassurance Scale (self-criticism and self-reassurance), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (positive/negative affect), and Gratitude questionnaire (gratitude) at baseline, postintervention (3 months), 3-and 9-month follow-up. Results: Compared with the waitlist control group, the CFT group showed superior improvement on well-being at postintervention, d =.51, 95% CI [.25,.77], p <.001, and 3-month follow-up, d =.39, 95% CI [.13,.65], p <.001. No significant moderators were found. On all secondary outcome measures but positive affect, the intervention group showed significantly greater improvements up to 3-month follow-up. At 9-month follow-up, improvements on all measures were retained or amplified among CFT participants.

1672,Advances in recovery research: What have we learned? What should be done next?,"Job-stress recovery during nonwork time is an important factor for employee well-being. This article reviews the recovery literature, starting with a brief historical overview. It provides a definition of recovery that differentiates between recovery as a process and recovery as an outcome. Empirical studies have shown that recovery activities (e.g., physical exercise) and recovery experiences (e.g., psychological detachment from work) are negatively associated with strain symptoms (e.g., exhaustion) and positively associated with positive well-being indicators (e.g., vigor). Recovery activities and recovery experiences suffer when employees face a high level of job stressors. Psychological mechanisms underlying recovery seem to be similar across different temporal recovery settings (e.g., work breaks, free evenings, vacations) and seem to be enhanced in natural environments. Intervention studies have pointed to a diverse set of strategies for how everyday job-stress recovery can be supported. This article discusses 5 avenues for future research, with a particular focus on individual and contextual factors that may influence recovery as well as highlighting more complex temporal patterns than those uncovered in previous research.

1673,Therapeutic education of families of patients with schizophrenia: The Lebanese HÃ´tel-Dieu de France model [Ã‰ducation thÃ©rapeutique de familles de patients schizophrÃ¨nesÂ : le modÃ¨le de l'HÃ´tel-Dieu de France au Liban],"Introduction Schizophrenia is a chronic illness that causes considerable functional disability. The care of a schizophrenic patient is a heavy burden which impacts negatively the patient's family. It alters the quality of life of the caregiver and creates a distress and dissatisfaction with respect to his/her role due to several factors. This negative effect on the patient's support system can also indirectly affect the prognosis of the patient's disease through the increase of relapse rate, therefore entering a vicious cycle. The therapeutic education of families of patients suffering of schizophrenia has revealed to be an efficient and positive intervention on many levels. An efficient psychoeducation program can improve the knowledge of the family members, decrease the burden of the disease and reduce the patient's relapse rate. Objectives Given the frequent solicitation of the psychiatric team by the caregivers, a psychoeducation program for the family members of schizophrenic patients was implemented at the psychiatric department of HÃ´tel-Dieu de France, a University Hospital in Lebanon, aiming to help these families in acquiring a realistic vision of the disease, thus enabling them to actively collaborate in psychiatric care, and to tackle and discuss the common daily encountered problems in the management of such patients, finally suggesting ways to deal with these problems. Description Selected family members of three schizophrenic patients attended the psychoeducation program after obtaining the consent of the patients. The intervention consisted of ten sessions, of one hour and a half each, at the pace of one session per week and it was led by a multidisciplinary team: a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a nursing manager and an occupational therapist. The psychoeducation program consisted of the presentation of the disease and of related important information, of debriefing sessions and of experience-sharing sessions between the three families. An assessment of knowledge related to schizophrenia was made before and after the implementation of the program. Contribution The psychoeducation program enabled the families to acquire new and useful knowledge about the disease, helped in relieving their distress and in dealing with negative emotions caused by the presence of the disease in a family member. Since the family constitutes a central hub in the patient's life in Lebanese society, such therapeutic education of families of patients with schizophrenia is found to be essential in the management of the disease. Many psychoeducational approaches have been described in the literature. They differ from one another by the program's content and/or duration and the composition of the attending group. In our case, we implemented a relatively short program to a multiple-family group without the participation of the patients. Conclusion The implementation of a psychoeducation program to the families of patients suffering of schizophrenia is important because the family members continually face particularly difficult circumstances. Such programs have several positive effects on both family members and patient. However, their long-term effects should be further evaluated and the duration of the program should be adapted accordingly. Such interventions may also be of benefit when implemented to families of patients with chronic mental disorders other than schizophrenia.

1675,Long-term Benefits of Home-based Preventive Care for Preterm Infants: A Randomized Trial,"BACKGROUND: We have previously reported improved caregiver mental health and infant behavior at 2 years following a home-based preventive care program for very preterm infants and their caregivers. This study aimed to determine the longer-term effectiveness of the program by reviewing caregivers and children at preschool age.METHODS: One hundred twenty very preterm infants (<30 weeks' gestation) were randomly allocated to intervention (n = 61) or control (n = 59) groups. The intervention included 9 home visits over the first year of life targeting infant development, parent mental health, and the parent-infant relationship. The control group received standard care. At 4 years' corrected age, child cognitive, behavioral, and motor functioning and caregiver mental health were assessed.RESULTS: At age 4 years, 105 (89%) children were reviewed. There was little evidence of differences in cognitive or motor functioning between groups. The intervention group had lower scores for child internalizing behaviors than the control group (mean difference -5.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] -9.6 to -0.9, P = .02). Caregivers in the intervention group had fewer anxiety symptoms (mean difference -1.8, 95% CI -3.3 to -0.4, P = .01) and were less likely to exhibit ""at-risk"" anxiety (odds ratio 0.3, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.7, P = .01) than those in the control group.CONCLUSIONS: This home-based preventive care program for very preterm infants has selective long-term benefits, including less caregiver anxiety and reduced preschooler internalizing behaviors.

1678,Trait rumination predicts onset of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder through trauma-related cognitive appraisals: A 4-year longitudinal study,"Trauma-related rumination and worry predict chronic PTSD. This study examined whether habitual rumination and worry measured prior to trauma exposure make persons more vulnerable to the onset of PTSD, presumably because habitual ruminators and worriers will be more prone to cognitively appraise trauma exposure in a negative way. A sample of 2981 adults aged 18-65, consisting of healthy controls and persons with past or current depressive and/or anxiety disorders were assessed at baseline and at follow-up four years later (n=2402). At follow-up, 359 participants reported exposure to a traumatic event during the last four years of whom 52 (14.4%) had developed PTSD. Pre-trauma self-reported depression severity and trait rumination - but not trait worry-predicted onset of PTSD during follow-up, controlling for demographic and clinical history variables, as well as psychiatric diagnoses at baseline. The relation of trait rumination with onset of PTSD was partly mediated by the cognitive appraisal of the traumatic event and not by the affective reaction to trauma exposure. Repetitive negative thinking in the form of rumination may be a risk factor for onset of PTSD amenable to prevention and intervention.

Participants are instructed to follow a certain decision rule according to safety guidelines. Violations of this rule are associated with potential high rewards (working faster and earning more money) but also with the risk of a catastrophe (an explosion). Stress was induced with the Trier Social Stress Test while control participants underwent a non-stress condition. In the simulation task, stressed females broke the safety rule more often than unstressed females: Ï‡2 (1, N = 24) = 10.36, p < 0.001, V = 0.66. In males, no difference between stressed and unstressed participants was observed.

1688,"Worldwide Stress: Different Problems, Similar Solutions? Cultural Adaptation and Evaluation of a Standardized Stress Management Program in Hungary","Chronic stress is an important risk factor for morbidity and premature mortality at the individual and societal level. Our aim was to describe the process of adapting and testing the effectiveness of a structured stress management skills training program in a culture different from the one in which it was first developed. We translated an internationally used standardized behavioral intervention program into Hungarian and adapted it for use in a Hungarian cultural setting. We evaluated the changes in stress level and stress-related symptom scores among distressed voluntary participants on the basis of self-reported questionnaires completed before, immediately after, and 4 to 6 months after the 12-h intervention. The following measures were included: PSS-10, STAI-T, BDI-S, PHQ-15, and WBI-5. For statistical analyses, paired sample t test and Cohen's d value for effect size were used. In a sample of 107 distressed individuals, after the training, stress level, psychological and somatic symptoms decreased and well-being increased (p < 0.0001). These positive changes were maintained at follow-up in a subsample of 42 persons tested 4-6 months later. These results confirm the long-term positive effects of this standardized behavioral intervention in a different cultural context and in real-world settings, which encourages further dissemination of the program in various community settings.","Stauder, A; Thege, BK; Kovacs, ME; Balog, P; Williams, VP; Williams, RB",0,10.1007/s12529-009-9054-4,1291
1689,"Impact of a mindfulness stress management program on stress, anxiety, depression and quality of life in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A randomized controlled trial","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder with a significant psychological burden throughout the life course of affected women. Thus, use of mindful awareness may be beneficial as an adjunct to conventional medical management of women with PCOS. A randomized, controlled trial was conducted at the Evgenideion Hospital of the Athens University Medical School to explore the impact of an 8-week mindfulness stress management program on measures of depression, anxiety and stress as well as on the quality of life in reproductive age women with PCOS. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee. Twenty-three and 15 women with PCOS were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group, respectively. All participants were administered DASS21, PSS-14, PCOSQ, Daily Life and General Life Satisfaction Questionnaires and provided three-timed daily samples of salivary cortisol, before and after the intervention. Intervention group participants were provided with the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire at the day of enrolment, to check for possible placebo effect on the outcome. Post-intervention, between-group results revealed statistically significant reductions in stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as in salivary cortisol concentrations, along with an increase in Life Satisfaction and Quality of Life scores in the intervention group only.

1690,Cognitively oriented behavioral rehabilitation in combination with qigong for patients on long-term sick leave because of burnout: REST-A randomized clinical trial,"Background: Despite an increase in the occurrence of burnout, there is no agreement on what kind of rehabilitation these patients should be offered. Purpose: Primary aim of this study was to evaluate effects on psychological variables and sick leave rates by two different group rehabilitation programs for patients on long-term sick leave because of burnout. Rehabilitation program A (Cognitively oriented Behavioral Rehabilitation (CBR) and Qigong) was compared with rehabilitation program B (Qigong only). Method: In a randomized clinical trial, 96 women and 40 men with a mean age of 41.6Â±7.4 years were allocated to one of the two rehabilitation programs. Results: A per-protocol analysis showed no significant difference in treatment efficacy between the groups. Both groups improved significantly over time with reduced levels of burnout, self-rated stress behavior, fatigue, depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and sick leave rates. In an intention-to-treat analysis, patients in program A had fewer obsessive-compulsive symptoms and larger effect sizes in self-rated stress behavior and obsessive-compulsive symptoms compared to patients in program B. Conclusion: This study showed no differences in effect between CBR and Qigong compared with Qigong only in a per-protocol analysis. Both rehabilitation programs showed positive effect for patients with burnout.

1693,A self-directed psychosocial intervention with minimal therapist contact for adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,"Using a randomized controlled design, the efficacy of a self-directed psychosocial intervention with minimal therapist contact, aimed at reducing the symptoms of adult ADHD, was examined. Following the intervention, the treatment group reported significantly reduced ADHD symptomatology; improved organizational skills; improved self esteem and better anger control, when compared to waiting list controls. Comorbid anxiety, depression, high levels of stress and learning problems, did not effect treatment outcome. Improvements in ADHD symptomatology and organizational skills were maintained at a 2-month follow-up. Although the programme was successful, close adherence to the programme was necessary for optimum treatment gains. These findings build upon an earlier study that used a more intensive form of programme delivery and support the view that psychosocial interventions can enhance daily functioning for adult ADHD.

1694,Clinicians' Perspectives on Cognitive Therapy in Community Mental Health Settings: Implications for Training and Implementation,"Policymakers are investing significant resources in large-scale training and implementation programs for evidence-based psychological treatments (EBPTs) in public mental health systems. However, relatively little research has been conducted to understand factors that may influence the success of efforts to implement EBPTs for adult consumers of mental health services. In a formative investigation during the development of a program to implement cognitive therapy (CT) in a community mental health system, we surveyed and interviewed clinicians and clinical administrators to identify potential influences on CT implementation within their agencies. Four primary themes were identified. Two related to attitudes towards CT: (1) ability to address client needs and issues that are perceived as most central to their presenting problems, and (2) reluctance to fully implement CT. Two themes were relevant to context: (1) agency-level barriers, specifically workload and productivity concerns and reactions to change, and (2) agency-level facilitators, specifically, treatment planning requirements and openness to training. These findings provide information that can be used to develop strategies to facilitate the implementation of CT interventions for clients being treated in public-sector settings.","Stirman, Shannon Wiltsey; Gutierrez-Colina, Ana; Toder, Katherine; Esposito, Gregory; Barg, Frances; Castro, Frank; Beck, Aaron T.; Crits-Christoph, Paul",0,10.1007/s10488-012-0418-8,1295
1695,Educational programmes in COPD management interventions: A systematic review,"Background: According to practice guidelines, educational programmes for patients with COPD should address several educational topics. Which topics are incorporated in the existing programmes remains unclear.Objectives: To delineate educational topics integrated in current COPD management interventions; and to examine strengths, weaknesses, and methods of delivery of the educational programmes.Data sources: A systematic literature search was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Clinical Trials, and Web of Science. The authors of included studies were contacted for additional information.Study selection: Studies that contained educational programmes incorporated in COPD management interventions were included.Data extraction: Data were extracted using a pre-designed data form. The Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework was used for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the programmes.Data synthesis: In total, 81 articles, describing 67 interventions were included. The majority (53.8%) of the studies incorporated 10 or more educational topics. The following topics were frequently addressed: smoking cessation (80.0%); medication (76.9%); exercise (72.3%); breathing strategies (70.8%); exacerbations (69.2%); and stress management (67.7%). Printed material and/or brochure (90.5%) and demonstrations and practice (73.8%), were the predominant tool and method, respectively. Nurses (75.8%), physicians (37.9%) and physiotherapists (34.8%) were the most involved healthcare professionals.Conclusions: Heterogeneity and wide variation in the content and the method of delivery of educational interventions were present. Alignment between educational topics incorporated in the existing programmes and those recommended by the COPD guidelines, involvement of various professionals and combined use of methods should be emphasised.

1696,Delayed recovery of working memory following day-case surgery,"Post-operative recovery of cognitive function is an important outcome measure following surgical anaesthesia. This study examined the influence of task complexity in 12 patients undergoing elective day-case surgery using reaction time tasks that differed in their stimulus-response mapping rules (compatible, incompatible, working memory). Tasks were administered at baseline, and at 1, 4 and 24 hours post-surgery. Compared to a reference group of 18 non-anaesthetised volunteers, the patient group showed considerable slowing one hour post-operatively. This slowing remained at the time of discharge (4-hours), was absent the next day, and did not vary as a function of task complexity. Only attentional lapses in the working memory task were sensitive to the recovery process and residual impairment remained the next day. The findings indicate that tasks requiring efficient access to working memory are impaired for longer than tasks simply requiring access to information passively retained in short-term memory.

Comparison of chronic and acute stress responses in middle-aged airline pilots,"Lipids increase during psychological stress, but no studies have compared the effects of acute and chronic stressors on lipid responsivity in the same individuals. One hundred middle-aged men (n = 92) and women (n = 8) were examined during high chronic occupational stress, low chronic stress, and acute laboratory stressors. In addition to measures of perceived stress and affect, an extensive battery of lipid and lipoprotein measures was undertaken at each time point. Most lipid parameters were significantly increased during the chronic and acute stressors, although the responses to the different stressors were not consistently associated. For example, significant correlations among the chronic and acute stress responses were apparent for the apoproteins, but not for total, low density lipoprotein, or high density lipoprotein cholesterol. The factors and processes regulating these variables during stress may be different during acute and chronic stressors.","Stoney C.M., Niaura R., Bausserman L., Matacin M.",0,10.1037/0278-6133.18.3.241,1299
1700,'Girls need to strengthen each other as a group': Experiences from a gender-sensitive stress management intervention by youth-friendly Swedish health services - A qualitative study,"Background: Mental health problems among young people, and girls and young women in particular, are a well-known health problem. Such gendered mental health patterns are also seen in conjunction with stress-related problems, such as anxiety and depression and psychosomatic complaints. Thus, intervention models tailored to the health care situation experienced by young women within a gendered and sociocultural context are needed. This qualitative study aims to illuminate young women's experiences of participating in a body-based, gender-sensitive stress management group intervention by youth-friendly health services in northern Sweden. Methods. A physiotherapeutic body-based, health-promoting, gender-sensitive stress management intervention was created by youth-friendly Swedish health services. The stress management courses (n = 7) consisted of eight sessions, each lasting about two hours, and were led by the physiotherapist at the youth centre. The content in the intervention had a gender-sensitive approach, combining reflective discussions; short general lectures on, for example, stress and pressures related to body ideals; and physiotherapeutic methods, including body awareness and relaxation. Follow-up interviews were carried out with 32 young women (17-25 years of age) after they had completed the intervention. The data were analysed with qualitative content analysis. Results: The overall results of our interview analysis suggest that the stress management course we evaluated facilitated 'a space for gendered and embodied empowerment in a hectic life', implying that it both contributed to a sense of individual growth and allowed participants to unburden themselves of stress problems within a trustful and supportive context. Participants' narrated experiences of 'finding a social oasis to challenge gendered expectations', 'being bodily empowered', and 'altering gendered positions and stance to life' point to empowering processes of change that allowed them to cope with distress, despite sometimes continuously stressful life situations. This intervention also decreased stress-related symptoms such as anxiousness, restlessness, muscle tension, aches and pains, fatigue, and impaired sleep. Conclusions: The participants' experiences of the intervention as a safe and exploratory space for gendered collective understanding and embodied empowerment further indicates the need to develop gender-sensitive interventions to reduce individualisation of health problems and instead encourage spaces for collective support, action, and change.

1701,Gender-sensitive and youth-friendly physiotherapy: Steps toward a stress management intervention for girls and young women,"This article describes and evaluates initial steps of a gender-sensitive, youth-friendly group intervention model designed for teenage girls and young women who experience stress-related or psychosomatic problems. Fifty-four young women (16-25 years of age) participated in a gender-sensitive physiotherapy stress management course at a youth health center. Inclusion criteria were self-defined stress-related problems and a wish to participate in the group intervention. Measurements of aspects of body perception, self-image, multiple somatic problems, and mental health symptom areas were assessed both before and after intervention with the Body Perception Questionnaire ad modum SchiÃ¶ler, social analysis of social behavior, and Adult Self-Report scale. Significant positive changes were found in aspects of body perception, self-image, and mental health and somatic symptoms. The changes were most significant in lower internalization of anxiety and depression symptoms. Symptoms such as headaches and sleeping problems decreased. Participants were more satisfied with their bodies and more able to listen to body signals. Among cognitive issues, significant change occurred in thought problems, but not in attention problems. The intervention model needs further evaluation in controlled trials, but is promising and should be developed further in other physiotherapy settings and subgroups of young people.

Potentially confounding determinants of sCort and sAA may limit a reliable concurrent measurement of both biomarkers, if not adequately considered. We reviewed the most important determinants of sCort and sAA and provide recommendations for handling these potential confounders. We focused on a selection of confounders, resulting in an in-depth consideration of age, sex steroid-related factors, somatic health, acute medication, smoking, consumption of food and drinks, alcohol consumption, physical activity/fitness, and sleep. Our review further highlights the importance of the consideration of potential confounders for a reliable and valid simultaneous measurement of sCort and sAA. We further provide recommendations about which and how to handle relevant confounders in the study design or data analysis.

1704,Physical Functioning and Rehabilitation for the Cancer Survivor,"There are more than 13.8 million survivors of cancer living in the United States. Up to 20% of survivors of childhood-onset and 53% of survivors of adult-onset cancer have problems with physical function as a result of their cancer and or its treatment. These problems may be immediately apparent, during, or soon after initial cancer treatment, or may appear days, months, or years later as the cancer survivor ages. Unfortunately, rehabilitation services and providers are not easily or systematically accessible in today's healthcare system. Rehabilitation services that restore or ameliorate early functional loss or that protect against or minimize the impact of later-onset organ system dysfunction are available, at least in larger comprehensive cancer center settings. This report describes physical function, details the evolution of cancer rehabilitation, and identifies cancer survivors who may benefit from rehabilitation services. Additionally, the evidence for specific approaches to rehabilitation, intervention, and prevention of functional loss are reviewed. Finally, we summarize the mechanisms used to measure physical function and stress the need for additional research to support rehabilitation services for cancer survivors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

1705,Lower cumulative stress is associated with better health for physically active adults in the community,"Both cumulative adversity, an individual's lifetime exposure to stressors, and insufficient exercise are associated with poor health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether exercise buffers the association of cumulative adverse life events (CALE) with health in a community-wide sample of healthy adults (ages 18-50 years; women: n=219, 29.5Â±9.2 years; men: n=176, 29.4Â±8.7 years, meanÂ±standard deviation). Participants underwent the Cumulative Adversity Interview, which divides life events into three subsets: major life events (MLE), recent life events (RLE) and traumatic experiences (TLE). These individuals also completed the Cornell Medical Index and a short assessment for moderate or greater intensity exercise behavior, modified from the Nurses' Health Study. Results indicated that higher CALE was associated with greater total health problems (r=0.431, p<0.001). Interactions between stress and exercise were not apparent for RLE and TLE. However, at low levels of MLE, greater exercise was related to fewer total, physical, cardiovascular and psychological health problems (p value <0.05). Conversely, at high levels of MLE, the benefits of exercise appear to be absent. Three-way interactions were observed between sex, exercise and stress. Increased levels of exercise were related to better physical health in men, at all levels of CALE. Only women who reported both low levels of CALE and high levels of exercise had more favorable physical health outcomes. A similar pattern of results emerged for RLE. Together, these data suggest that increased exercise is related to better health, but these effects may vary by cumulative stress exposure and sex.

1706,Improving physical and mental health in frontline mental health care providers: Yoga-based stress management versus cognitive behavioral stress management,"The need for brief, low-cost, easily disseminable, and effective interventions to promote healthy lifestyles is high. This is especially true for mental health providers. The authors developed two studies to compare the impacts of Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) and Yoga-Based Stress Management (YBSM) interventions for health care professionals. Study 1 offered an 8-week YBSM intervention to 37 mental health care participants and collected health data pre- and post. Study 2 offered YBSM and CBSM classes to 40 randomly assigned mental health care providers and collected mental and physical health data at four time points. In Study 1, using t tests, the YBSM intervention affected a number of mental and physical well-being indices pre to post. In Study 2, using linear mixed modeling, YBSM and CBSM groups both improved significantly (p <.05) in fruit and vegetable intake, heart rate, alcohol consumption, relaxation and awareness, professional quality of life, compassion satisfaction, burnout, depression, and stress levels. There was a group by time effect for coping confidence (CBSM increased more, p <.05, F = 4.34), physical activity (YBSM increased more, p <.05, F = 3.47), overall mental health (YBSM increased more, p <.10, F = 5.32), and secondary traumatic stress (YBSM decreased more, p <.10, F = 4.89). YBSM and CBSM appear to be useful for health care professionalsâ€™ mental and physical health. YBSM demonstrates some benefit above and beyond the extremely well studied and empirically supported CBSM, including increased physical activity, overall mental health, and decreased secondary traumatic stress benefits.

Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent type of psychiatric disorders in general populations. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the prototypical psychological treatment for anxiety disorders which is characterized by teaching the so-called coping skills which include both cognitive and behavioral techniques that can counteract anxiety and are often related to relevant situations, such as those inducing anxiety. There are a wide range of behavioral interventions to treat anxiety and fear in people with developmental disabilities. Obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) are characterized by intrusive thoughts, images, or ideas (obsessions) and the engagement in repetitive, apparently nonfunctional overt and covert behavior to neutralize the obsessions or in response to rigid rules.

1708,Underuse of Yoga as a Referral Resource by Health Professions Students,"Objective: Nearly 38% of U.S. adults use complementary and alternative medicine approaches to manage physical conditions (e.g., chronic pain, arthritis, cancer, heart disease, and high blood pressure) and psychological or emotional health concerns (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression). Research evidence has accumulated for yoga as an effective treatment approach for these conditions. Further, yoga has increased in popularity among healthcare providers and the general population. Given these trends, this study explored perceptions about yoga as a viable complementary treatment to which health professions students would refer patients.Participants: More than 1500 students enrolled in health professions programs at a Pacific Northwest school were enrolled; data were obtained from 478 respondents.Design: The study assessed willingness to refer patients to yoga as a complementary and alternative medicine for 27 symptoms (identified in the literature as having evidence for yoga's utility), which were subsequently grouped into skeletal, physical, and psychological on the basis of factor analysis. Responses were assessed using a mixed-model analysis of variance with health profession and yoga practitioner as between-subjects variables and symptoms as a within-subjects factor.Results: In descending order of likelihood to refer patients to yoga were students in occupational therapy, physician assistant program, psychology, physical therapy, pharmacy, dental hygiene, speech and audiology, and optometry. All groups perceived yoga's greatest utility for skeletal symptoms, followed by psychological and physical symptoms. Findings also revealed a significant positive relationship between level of personal yoga practice and willingness to refer patients to yoga.Conclusions: Although students expressed some openness to referring patients to yoga, ratings of appropriateness were not accurately aligned with extant evidence base. Personal experience seemed to be a salient factor for accepting yoga as a referral target. These findings suggest the importance of developing strategies to make health professionals more aware of the merits of yoga, regardless of whether they themselves are yoga practitioners.","Sulenes, Kari; Freitas, Jillian; Justice, Lauren; Colgan, Dana Dharmakaya; Shean, Margaret; Brems, Christiane",0,10.1089/acm.2014.0217,1307
1709,Integrating psychosocial and behavioral interventions to achieve optimal rehabilitation outcomes,"Introduction: Psychosocial factors are important contributors to work disability associated with musculoskeletal conditions. The primary objectives of this paper were 1) to describe different psychosocial interventions that have been developed to prevent prolonged work disability, and 2) to identify future research directions that might enhance the impact of programs targeting psychosocial risk factors for work disability. Methods: Selective review of scientific literature on psychosocial and behavioral interventions and work disability. Results: Most prior interventions focused on psychosocial risk factors that exist primarily within the individual (e.g., pain catastrophizing, beliefs, expectancies). Successful disability prevention will require methods to assess and target psychosocial risk factors ""outside"" of the individual (e.g., interpersonal conflict in the workplace, job stress, etc.) using cost-effective, multipronged approaches. Research to explore interactions among different domains of psychosocial risk factors in relation to RTW outcomes is needed. Challenges to effective secondary prevention of work disability include developing competencies to enable a range of providers to deliver interventions, standardization of psychosocial interventions, and maximizing adherence to intervention protocols. Conclusion: Effective secondary prevention of work disability will require research to develop cost-effective, multipronged approaches that concurrently target both worker-related and workplace psychosocial risk factors.","Sullivan, MJL; Feuerstein, M; Gatchel, R; Linton, SJ; Pransky, G",0,10.1007/s10926-005-8029-9,1308

Out of 144 eligible male patients recently treated with percantaneous transluminal coronary angiography (PTCA), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 132 were randomized into this study. All interventions covered a 12-month active intervention, intense during the first months and subsequently leveled out. Main assessments were performed before randomization and after the intervention. Patients offered behavioral rehabilitation showed improved self-reported healthy diet habits and exercise frequency, and higher internal locus of control. Although blood lipids, exercise capacity, body mass, anxiety, depression, and Type A scores were changed in the expected direction, no significant difference emerged between active intervention and the standard care condition. Standard care of today appears to have great potential in particular if supplemented with some kind of stress management.","Sundin Ã–., Lisspers J., Hofman-Bang C., Nygren Ã…., RydÃ©n L., Ã–hman A.",0,10.1207/S15327558IJBM1003_01,1309
1711,SUDARSHAN KRIYA FOR MALE PATIENTS WITH PSYCHO ACTIVE SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL,"Objectives: The aims of the study were to investigate whether Sudarshan Kriya (SK), a form of Yoga and related practices can lead to increased Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and increased feeling of wellness in patients with substance dependence. Method: This was a 3-month single blind parallel randomized controlled study with sample size of 111 patients which were allocated by simple randomization to two groups. Study subjects were involved in an intensive program of Sudarshan Kriya and practices (SK&P) which they practised daily for 6 weeks. The control subjects were instructed to sit in an armchair with their eyes closed and pay gentle attention to their breath. A period sample of three months consisting of all patients admitted in De-addiction (DAC) ward fulfilling study criteria was taken. Only male patients diagnosed to be suffering from Substance Dependence by ICD-10 (DCR) criteria, aged between 18-65 years were included in this study. The assessment tools were the Basic Socio-demographic Performa, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS), Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) based clinical interview, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Psychological General Well Being (PGWB). These assessments were conducted before starting the intervention and six weeks thereafter. Results: In the final analysis, number of participants analyzed in the study group was 55 and in the control group was 56. Majority of subjects were unemployed, married individuals who did not have occupational skills of more than skilled labour level. After six weeks of SK& P, statistically significant improvement in study subject dimensional scores of GAF (48.43+/- 0.08 to 66.77+/-0.14), Anxiety (ANX) (9.64+/-0.52 to 15.66+/-0.38), Depressed Mood (DEP)(7.19+/-0.2 to 9.18+/-0.37), Positive Well Being (PWB)(10.28+/-0.61 to 12.92+/-0.73), General Health (GH)(7.74+/-0.18 to 9.75+/-0.22) and Total PGWB(41.46+/-0.35 to 59.28+/-0.63) were noticed. However, when compared with control subjects, improvement was statistically significant in the case of GAF (p=0.000158), Anxiety (ANX)(p=0.011), Positive Well Being (PWB)(p=0.02), General Health (GH)(p=0.02) and Total PGWB(p=0.05); but not in the case of Depressed Mood (DEP), Self Control (SC) and Vitality. Conclusion: Practicing SK&P helps in improving Global Assessment of Functioning, Psychological General Well Being, General Health (GH) and positive well being of an individual. SK&P also causes significant reduction in anxiety levels of an individual.","Sureka, Pankaj; Govil, Sandeep; Dash, Debadutta; Dash, Chandika; Kumar, Mukesh; Singhal, Vikas",0,,1310
1715,"Integrated, exposure-based treatment for PTSD and comorbid substance use disorders: Predictors of treatment dropout","High rates of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUD) have been noted in veteran populations. Fortunately, there are a number of evidence-based psychotherapies designed to address comorbid PTSD and SUD. However, treatments targeting PTSD and SUD simultaneously often report high dropout rates. To date, only one study has examined predictors of dropout from PTSD/SUD treatment. To address this gap in the literature, this study aimed to 1) examine when in the course of treatment dropout occurred, and 2) identify predictors of dropout from a concurrent treatment for PTSD and SUD. Participants were 51 male and female veterans diagnosed with current PTSD and SUD. All participants completed at least one session of a cognitive-behavioral treatment (COPE) designed to simultaneously address PTSD and SUD symptoms. Of the 51 participants, 22 (43.1%) dropped out of treatment prior to completing the full 12 session COPE protocol. Results indicated that the majority of dropout (55%) occurred after session 6, with the largest amount of dropout occurring between sessions 9 and 10. Results also indicated a marginally significant relationship between greater baseline PTSD symptom severity and premature dropout. These findings highlight inconsistencies related to timing and predictors of dropout, as well as the dearth of information noted about treatment dropout within PTSD and SUD literature. Suggestions for procedural changes, such as implementing continual symptom assessments during treatment and increasing dialog between provider and patient about dropout were made with the hopes of increasing consistency of findings and eventually reducing treatment dropout.

1716,Aetiology and risk factors of musculoskeletal disorders in physically active conscripts: a follow-up study in the Finnish Defence Forces,"Background: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the main reason for morbidity during military training. MSDs commonly result in functional impairment leading to premature discharge from military service and disabilities requiring long-term rehabilitation. The purpose of the study was to examine associations between various risk factors and MSDs with special attention to the physical fitness of the conscripts.Methods: Two successive cohorts of 18 to 28-year-old male conscripts (N = 944, median age 19) were followed for six months. MSDs, including overuse and acute injuries, treated at the garrison clinic were identified and analysed. Associations between MSDs and risk factors were examined by multivariate Cox's proportional hazard models.Results: During the six-month follow-up of two successive cohorts there were 1629 MSDs and 2879 health clinic visits due to MSDs in 944 persons. The event-based incidence rate for MSD was 10.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 10.0-11.1) per 1000 person-days. Most MSDs were in the lower extremities (65%) followed by the back (18%). The strongest baseline factors associated with MSDs were poor result in the combined outcome of a 12-minute running test and back lift test (hazard ratio (HR) 2.9; 95% CI: 1.9-4.6), high waist circumference (HR 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3-2.2), high body mass index (HR 1.8; 95% CI: 1.3-2.4), poor result in a 12-minute running test (HR 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.2), earlier musculoskeletal symptoms (HR 1.7; 95% CI: 1.3-2.1) and poor school success (educational level and grades combined; HR 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3-3.0). In addition, risk factors of long-term MSDs (= 10 service days lost due to one or several MSDs) were analysed: poor result in a 12-minute running test, earlier musculoskeletal symptoms, high waist circumference, high body mass index, not belonging to a sports club and poor result in the combined outcome of the 12-minute running test and standing long jump test were strongly associated with long-term MSDs.Conclusions: The majority of the observed risk factors are modifiable and favourable for future interventions.

1717,Resilience training that can change the brain,"In this article, we provide a review of the latest research on behavioral and cognitive strategies that cultivate resilience and change the brain. We begin with a primer on the neuroscience of emotions and stress and how the brain regulates them. Then we focus on two major pathways to building a resilient brain: (a) behavioral pathways (learnable behaviors and habits) and (b) cognitive pathways (learnable cognitive/linguistic strategies). For the former, we review behaviors that can directly down-regulate fear and stress, including facing fears and controlling stressors. We also review behaviors that can boost physical health and therefore resilience; these strategies include sleeping, exercising, and dietary restriction. In addition, we review social behaviors that can boost resilience, such as connecting socially and expressing gratitude. For the latter, we review cognitive pathways to resilience. These include emotion-regulation strategies such as verbal expression of emotion, affect labeling, and cognitive reappraisal. We also discuss cognitive-training approaches, including cognitive-bias modification, mindfulness training, and cognitive therapy. Finally, we discuss issues related to coaching resilience, including the neural bases of expectation, growth mind-set, and self-affirmation, three factors that can influence learning and effectiveness of the various strategies discussed in the article, and we close with a summary of the current understanding of resilience and the human brain.

A pretest-posttest, single-subject design was implemented with three families. After 5 months, atypical sensory processing and self-regulation improved by more than one standard deviation for all children. Parenting stress decreased by more than one standard deviation for two of the mothers. These results suggest that Qigong Sensory Training can be effective for children with or at-risk for autism when provided through a coaching model in an early intervention setting.","Tal-Atzili, Orit; Salls, Joyce",0,10.1080/19411243.2017.1325819,1314
1719,Debriefing after critical incidents for anaesthetic trainees,"This survey investigated the need, and the availability, of debriefing after critical incidents for training anaesthetists. A cross-sectional postal survey of all Australian anaesthetic trainees was conducted in May 2002. Four hundred and nineteen responses were analysed (response rate 64%). Debriefing after a critical incident was perceived by most trainees to be useful, however 36% (n= 149) had never been debriefed. Trainees ranked their preferred content for a debriefing as 'anaesthetic issues' followed by the 'psychological impact of the incident', 'patient issues' and 'surgical issues'. Almost half of respondents reported that they did not feel supported by their anaesthetic department after a negative outcome incident. Trainees who had debriefings were more likely to feel supported by senior colleagues. Debriefing after critical incidents should be an integral part of the supervision of anaesthetic trainees.","Tan, H",0,,1315

The sample included 113 elementary and secondary school teachers (89% female) from Canada and the United States. Measures were collected at baseline, post-program, and 3-month follow-up; teachers were randomly assigned to condition after baseline assessment. Results showed that 87% of teachers completed the program and found it beneficial. Teachers randomized to MT showed greater mindfulness, focused attention and working memory capacity, and occupational self-compassion, as well as lower levels of occupational stress and burnout at post-program and follow-up, than did those in the control condition. No statistically significant differences due to MT were found for physiological measures of stress. Mediational analyses showed that group differences in mindfulness and self-compassion at post-program mediated reductions in stress and burnout as well as symptoms of anxiety and depression at follow-up. Implications for teaching and learning are discussed.","Roeser, Robert W.; Schonert-Reichl, Kimberly A.; Jha, Amishi; Cullen, Margaret; Wallace, Linda; Wilensky, Rona; Oberle, Eva; Thomson, Kimberly; Taylor, Cynthia; Harrison, Jessica",1,10.1037/a0032093,1316
1721,Advantages and Challenges of A Village Doctor-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Late-Life Depression in Rural China: A Qualitative Study,"BackgroundThe delivery of mental health services in rural China has been notably limited due to lack of qualified mental health professionals among other impeding factors. A village doctor-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention may be one way of improving accessibility. The purpose of this study was to explore the advantages and challenges of implementing this intervention, as delivered by trained village doctors, to treat late-life depression in rural China.MethodsWe conducted one focus group discussion with 10 village doctors, 10 individual interviews with each of the village doctors, and individual interviews with 19 older adults. The topic guides were advantages and challenges of the intervention program from the perspective of the village doctors and older adults. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded using NVivo 8, and analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsThe village doctors stressed the importance of role-playing and using instructive manuals in the training. Proper supervision was also a key component of the program. The benefits received from the intervention for the village doctors and the elders were positive such that both the doctors and the older adults were willing to implement/receive this intervention. Cultural and political factors (renqing and perceived policy consideration) facilitated the elders' access to mental health services. Challenges included a lack of real therapy (in contrast to role-playing) demonstrated in the training and lack of a step-by-step manual based on different types of problems encountered. Other impediments to the successful implementation of the intervention included the time constraints of village doctors and the presence of other people when conducting the intervention.ConclusionsThe present study has demonstrated that the intervention program is likely to be an acceptable geriatric depression intervention in rural China if several challenges are appropriately addressed.","Tang, Xinfeng; Yang, Fahui; Tang, Tan; Yang, Xuemei; Zhang, Weijun; Wang, Xiaohua; Ji, Li; Xiao, Yun; Ma, Kun; Wang, Ying; Kong, Xianglei; Wang, Jianping; Liu, Jun; Xu, Qian; Tian, Donghua; Qu, Zhiyong",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0137555,1317

Material and Methods: Participants were randomly allocated to 1 of the 3 intervention modules: 1 â€“ the self-efficacy enhancement (N = 87), 2 â€“ the social support enhancement (N = 85), or to 3 â€“ the educational module (comparison group, N = 81). Participants completed the online questionnaires before the intervention (T1), immediately after (T2), and 4 weeks after the intervention (T3). Results: Due to high drop-out rate at T2 and T3 in social support enhancement module, we excluded from analysis participants assigned to this condition. Participants assigned to the self-efficacy enhancement module presented higher levels of self-efficacy (at T2 and T3), compared to those assigned to the educational module. Job burnout decreased significantly between T1 and T2, and between T2 and T3, and work engagement increased significantly between T1 and T2, and between T1 and T3, among participants assigned to both modules mentioned above. Self-efficacy (T2) mediated the relationship between the group assignment (educational module vs. self-efficacy enhancement module) and respectively job burnout (T3) or work engagement (T3). Conclusions: The results of our study highlight the role of self-efficacy in reducing job burnout and increasing work engagement. Â© 2016, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine.

1723,"Chronic stress in the mother-infant dyad: Maternal hair cortisol, infant salivary cortisol and interactional synchrony","Stress physiology is shaped by early experience, with enduring effects on health. The relation of chronic maternal physiological stress, as indexed by hair cortisol, to infantsâ€™ stress systems and to mother-infant interaction quality has not been established. We examined maternal hair and salivary cortisol, six-month-old infantsâ€™ salivary cortisol, and mother-infant interaction in 121 mother-infant dyads. High maternal hair cortisol was related to higher infant average salivary cortisol concentration. Maternal hair cortisol and bedtime salivary cortisol were both uniquely related to infant bedtime salivary cortisol. Mothers with higher hair cortisol were more intrusive and had lower positive engagement synchrony with their infants. Maternal intrusiveness moderated the association of maternal hair cortisol and infant salivary cortisol, such that maternal hair and infant average salivary cortisol were related only when mothers were more intrusive. Maternal chronic physiological stress may upregulate infantsâ€™ developing stress systems, particularly in the context of lower mother-infant interaction quality.

1728,Early adversity and adult health outcomes,"Adversity in childhood has effects on mental and physical health, not only in childhood but across the lifespan. A chief task of our research has been to define the pathways by which childhood experience has these surprising health outcomes, often decades later. The concept of allostatic load, which refers to dysregulations across major biological regulatory systems that have cumulative interacting adverse effects over time, provides a mechanism for understanding these relations and defining specific pathways. To chart these pathways, we examine early childhood socioeconomic status, family environment, and genetic predispositions as antecedents to socioemotional functioning/psychological distress; and neural responses to threat that have downstream effects on major stress regulatory systems, ultimately culminating in risks to mental and physical health outcomes. This integrative approach to investigating the impact of childhood experience on adult health outcomes illustrates the significance of multilevel integrative approaches to understanding developmental psychopathology more generally.

1730,"Traumatic stress and cardiopulmonary disease burden among low-income, urban heart failure patients","Background Traumatic events and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are associated with increased risk for cardiopulmonary disease (CPD) in veterans, men, and primarily White populations. Less is known about trauma, PTSD, and CPD burden among low-income, racial minority residents who are at elevated risk for trauma and PTSD. It was hypothesized that traumatic events and PTSD would be significantly associated with CPD burden among low-income, racial minority residents. Methods We evaluated cross-sectional relationships between traumatic events, PTSD, depression, and CPD burden in 251 low-income, urban, primarily Black adults diagnosed with heart failure. Data were analyzed using bivariate analyses, logistic and linear regression. Results Forty-three percent endorsed at least one traumatic event. Twenty-one percent endorsed two or more traumatic events. In logistic regression analyses, traumatic events were associated with increased prevalence of coronary artery disease (adjusted odds=1.33, p<.05), hypertension (adjusted odds=1.28, p<.05), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adjusted odds=1.52, p<.01), and cardiac arrest (adjusted odds=1.27, p<.05). PTSD was also related to increased risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adjusted odds=1.22, p<.05) and was associated with earlier onset of heart failure (Î²=-.13, p<.05). Limitations The study utilizes cross-sectional, self-report data. Conclusions Findings support the link between traumatic events, PTSD, and CPD burden in low-income, primarily Black patients with heart failure. Depression appears to be less closely linked to CPD burden, despite receiving significant attention in the literature. The accumulation of traumatic events may exacerbate CPD burden among urban, low-income, racial minority residents with heart failure; findings highlight the importance of PTSD screening.

1731,Group well-child care for high-risk families - Maternal outcomes,"Objective: To determine if participation in group sessions as part of health supervision visits for infants improves outcomes compared with individual visits in high-risk mothers.Study design: Randomized controlled clinical trial.Participants: Mothers of young infants who had at least 1 of the following risk factors: aged younger than 20 years at delivery, participation in Medicaid, less than a high school education, previous or ongoing substance abuse, or history of abuse as a child.Setting: Two urban university pediatric clinics in Seattle, Wash.Interventions: Mother-infant dyads were randomized to receive group well-child care (GWCC) or individual well-child care (IWCC) before the infant was 4 months old; the intervention continued until the child was 15 months old. Mothers completed the Sense of Competence and Social Isolation subscales from the Parenting Stress Index and Sarason's Social Support Questionnaire at enrollment and again on completion of the study. During the 11-month study period, 7 health supervision visits were scheduled for each mother-infant dyad. Social workers met periodically with mothers during the study and assessed the following functional outcomes: return to school, return to work, enrollment in a substance abuse treatment program, and becoming pregnant. In addition, data on study children were collected from,Child Protective Services to assess referrals because of suspected abuse and/or neglect.Results: Data were collected on 213 mother-infant dyads, including 108 who received GWCC and 105 who received IWCC. At the conclusion of the study period, similar proportions of GWCC and IWCC mothers scored in the high-risk range on the Sense of Competence subscale, Social Isolation subscale, and the Social Support Questionnaire (P = .57, .32, and .59, respectively). For more than 50% of the mothers, scores on the Sense of Competence and Social Isolation subscales deteriorated during the study period from the not-high-risk range to the high-risk range, regardless of assignment to GWCC or IWCC. No differences were noted between GWCC and IWCC mothers for any functional outcome. During the study period, 8.8% of children receiving GWCC were referred to Child Protective Services vs 8.3% of those receiving IWCC (P = .85).Conclusion: The format of well-child care may not be an important determinant of outcomes among high-risk mothers.","Taylor, JA; Kemper, KJ",0,,1326
1733,Intensive weekend group treatment for panic disorder and its impact on co-occurring PTSD: A pilot study,"This pilot study examines the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of delivering an intensive weekend group treatment for panic disorder (PD) to Veterans returning from deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan with co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The treatment program lasted 6 h each day and was delivered by two experienced therapists. Patients received core components of panic treatment, including psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, and interoceptive exposure. The interoceptive exposure exercises directly targeted anxiety sensitivity, a psychological construct also implicated in the maintenance of PTSD. Eighty-nine percent of patients who expressed interest in the treatment attended a baseline evaluation, and 63% of those who were study eligible initiated treatment. Treatment retention was high, with all 10 patients who initiated treatment completing the program. Veterans reported finding the treatment and delivery format highly acceptable and reported high levels of satisfaction. Panic symptoms improved significantly following the treatment and were maintained at a 7-month follow-up, with 71.4% of the sample reporting being panic free. Co-occurring PTSD symptoms also improved along with symptoms of anxiety and depression. Preliminary findings suggest that brief and intensive group treatments for PD/PTSD are a promising method of delivering cognitive behavioral therapy that may rapidly improve symptoms. This innovative treatment delivery format also may be a cost-effective way of increasing treatment engagement through increased access to quality care.

1734,"Does a combination of virtual reality, neuromodulation and neuroimaging provide a comprehensive platform for neurorehabilitation? - A narrative review of the literature","In the last decade, virtual reality (VR) training has been used extensively in video games and military training to provide a sense of realism and environmental interaction to its users. More recently, VR training has been explored as a possible adjunct therapy for people with motor and mental health dysfunctions. The concept underlying VR therapy as a treatment for motor and cognitive dysfunction is to improve neuroplasticity of the brain by engaging users in multisensory training. In this review, we discuss the theoretical framework underlying the use of VR as a therapeutic intervention for neurorehabilitation and provide evidence for its use in treating motor and mental disorders such as cerebral palsy, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, stroke, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and other related clinical areas. While this review provides some insights into the efficacy of VR in clinical rehabilitation and its complimentary use with neuroimaging (e.g., fNIRS and EEG) and neuromodulation (e.g., tDCS and rTMS), more research is needed to understand how different clinical conditions are affected by VR therapies (e.g., stimulus presentation, interactivity, control and types of VR). Future studies should consider large, longitudinal randomized controlled trials to determine the true potential of VR therapies in various clinical populations.

1735,"Association between age, distress, and orientations to happiness in individuals with disabilities","Purpose/Objective: To determine how age and distress are associated in individuals with disabilities, and how happiness and its components (meaning, pleasure, and engagement) mediate or moderate this relationship. Research Method/Design: These were cross-sectional analyses of survey data from 508 community-dwelling adults with a variety of self-reported health conditions and functional disabilities. Measures included the Orientations to Happiness Questionnaire and items from the Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System. Results: Greater distress was associated with lower global happiness in both mediation and moderation models. The mediation model showed that middle-aged participants (age: 45-64) scored lowest in global happiness, and the effect of age on distress was partially mediated by happiness. None of the happiness components mediated the relationship of age on distress. The moderation model showed a significant interaction effect for age and global happiness on distress, where younger participants low on happiness were significantly more distressed. Of the three happiness components, only meaning was significantly associated with distress. There was a significant interaction between age and meaning, where participants who were younger and scored low on the meaning scale reported significantly higher distress. Conclusions/Implications: Findings from this study lay groundwork for the development of clinical interventions to address distress in individuals with functional disabilities. Middle-aged and younger people with disabilities may be particularly affected by lower levels of happiness and might benefit from psychological interventions that focus on increasing overall well-being and providing meaning and purpose in life.

Developing a more unified approach through addressing identified movement impairments could result in improved dynamic balance, trunk stability, and functional movement quality while potentially minimizing the risk of incurring such injuries. Although the evidence supporting the utility of injury prediction and return-to-activity readiness screening tools is encouraging, considerable additional research is needed regarding improving sensitivity, specificity, and outcomes, and especially the implementation challenges and barriers in a military setting.

This study recruited adolescents from a support program for HIV-affected families and randomly assigned them by cluster to receive one of the following: (1) a structured group-based behavioral health intervention; (2) interpersonal psychotherapy group sessions; (3) both interventions; or (4) no new interventions. With 95% retention, 1014 adolescents were interviewed three times over a 22-month period. Intent-to-treat analyses, applying multivariate difference-in-difference probit regressions, were performed separately for boys and girls to assess intervention impacts on sexual risk behaviors. Exposure to a single intervention did not impact behaviors. Exposure to both interventions was associated with risk-reduction behaviors, but the outcomes varied by gender: boys reported fewer risky sexual partnerships (Î² =-.48, p =.05) and girls reported more consistent condom (Î² = 1.37, p =.02). There was no difference in the likelihood of sexual debut for either gender. Providing both psychological and behavioral interventions resulted in long-term changes in sexual behavior that were not present when either intervention was provided in isolation. Multifaceted approaches for reducing sexual risk behaviors among vulnerable adolescents hold significant promise for mitigating the HIV epidemic among this priority population.

Staff working in three similar homes were used as controls. Assessments were made of anxiety and depression levels and demands, supports and constraints at work. Staff in the intervention houses were also observed at work to determine who they were interacting with, the nature and type of the interaction and the amount of time spent on different aspects of the job. This information was used to inform and develop an intervention aimed at the groups of staff involved. Goals were: set with the aim of reducing levels of anxiety and depression in staff and these were subject to review. Reassessment in intervention houses showed reductions in anxiety and increased perceived support when compared to controls. There were also changes in some observational measures, particularly increased positive interactions and assistance given to clients, and formal education programmes. These results suggest that intervening to reduce levels of anxiety and depression can have a positive impact on work performance in these settings.","Rose, J; Jones, F; Fletcher, B",1,10.1080/02678379808256854,1334

Potential subjects were randomly selected from the community at large and, then screened for participation in the training program if some of several (mental) health risk factors could be attributed to them: past life-events, neuroticism, inassertiveness, avoidant coping style and lack of social support. The control group, which did not take part in the training program, consisted of individuals with a similar risk profile as those in the training group. The training program consisted of several stress-management techniques: changing unhealthy life-style, relaxation training, problem-solving training and social skills-training. Multivariate analyses of variance showed that the training group, as compared to the control group, reported significantly less distress,less trait anxiety, less daily hassles, more assertiveness and more satisfaction with social support at follow-up.

1744,Effects of an evidence-based parenting program on biobehavioral stress among at-risk mothers for child maltreatment: A pilot study,"Parental stress is an important risk factor for child maltreatment (CM) perpetration. Evidence-based, parent-training programs can decrease CM perpetration risk and reduce self-reported parental stress; however, little is known about how such programs impact physiological stress correlates. In this quasi-experimental pilot study, maternal biobehavioral responses were measured in response to SafeCare (R), an evidence-based program targeting CM, often implemented by social workers in child welfare settings. Maternal participants (N=18) were recruited to complete SafeCare and repeated within-subject assessments pre- and post-intervention. Analyses examined associations between self-reported parental stress and mental health symptomology with stress markers for cortisol, alpha-amylase, and dihydroepiandrosterone at baseline and follow-up. Baseline correlation analyses showed strong associations between parental stress, salivary cortisol levels, and alpha-amylase. At follow-up, significant correlations were found between parental stress and alpha-amylase for intervention completers (n=7). Completers on average exhibited decreases across self-reported parental stress and global distress symptomology and improvements in salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase levels. Participants with impaired cortisol levels at baseline were within normal limits post-intervention.

1746,The role of self-monitoring and response inhibition in improving sleep behaviours,"Background Young adults tend to have poor sleep, which may be a result of poor self-regulation. Purpose This study investigated whether manipulating two aspects of self-regulation: self-monitoring and response inhibition could improve sleep behaviours. Method University students (N=190) were randomly allocated to complete (1) a self-monitoring sleep diary and response inhibition training, (2) a sleep diary only, or (3) a control questionnaire daily for a period of 7 days. Results Outcome measures were three sleep hygiene behaviours previously found to be particularly important in this population: avoiding going to bed hungry and thirsty, avoiding anxiety and stress-provoking activity before bed, and making the bedroom and sleep environment restful. Those who completed diary-based self-monitoring successfully avoided anxiety and stress-provoking activity before bed more frequently than control participants, corresponding to a medium effect size, and further development may provide a simple intervention to improve aspects of sleep and other health behaviours. Conclusion There was no incremental effect of response inhibition training. Modified response inhibition training tasks may be worth investigating in future research.

1749,"Caregiver burden, time spent caring and health status in the first 12 months following stroke","Objective: To quantify time caring, burden and health status in carers of stroke patients after discharge from rehabilitation; to identify the potentially modifiable sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with these outcomes.Methods: Patients and carers prospectively interviewed 6 (n = 71) and 12 (n = 57) months after discharge. Relationships of carer and patient variables with burden, health status and time analysed by Gaussian and Poisson regression.Results: Carers showed considerable burden at 6 and 12 months. Carers spent 4.6 and 3.6 hours per day assisting patients with daily activities at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Improved patient motor and cognitive function were associated with reductions of up to 20 minutes per day in time spent in daily activities. Better patient mental health and cognitive function were associated with better carer mental health.Conclusions: Potentially modifiable factors such as these may be able to be targeted by caregiver training, support and education programmes and outpatient therapy for patients.","Tooth, L; McKenna, K; Barnett, A; Prescott, C; Murphy, S",0,10.1080/02699050500110785,1338
1750,The Evidence Base for Interventions Targeting Individuals With Work-Related PTSD: A Systematic Review and Recommendations,"The purpose of this study was to summarize the evidence base for interventions targeting individuals with work-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to make recommendations for clinicians and administrative decision makers involved in their rehabilitation, and to guide future research in this area. Particular attention was given to studies that were conducted in naturalistic clinical settings or in a workersâ€™ compensation claim context. Electronic searches of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, PILOTS, and EMBASE identified 11 articles. Study populations included railroad personnel, police officers, disaster workers, and individuals with industrial injuries. Interventions included trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. Several studies specifically targeted workers who had failed to return to work (RTW) after standard PTSD treatment. The results suggest that psychotherapy interventions are beneficial for helping clients recover from PTSD symptoms and RTW. In studies that reported on work status, RTW rates increased over time and generally lay between 58% and 80% across follow-up time points. Narrative impressions were supplemented by calculation of Risk Differences for individuals working at pretreatment versus posttreatment. Clinical consideration, methodological issues limiting the current body of work, and recommendations for future research are discussed.

1752,A randomized controlled trial of the effects of a stress management programme during pregnancy,"Background: Prenatal maternal stress is associated with adverse birth outcomes. Relaxation techniques might be effective in reducing stress during that period. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of applied relaxation in reducing anxiety and stress in pregnant women in their second trimester, as well as raising their sense of control. Also we expected to see a difference in some lifestyle factors associated with stress. A randomized control trial with a prospective pretest-posttest experimental design was used. Methods: Sixty primigravida women in their second trimester were assigned randomly to receive a 6-week stress management programme (N= 31) (relaxation breathing and progressive muscle relaxation, RB-PMR, twice a day) or not (N= 29). Self-reported validated measures were used to evaluate perceived stress, health locus of control and anxiety at baseline and at the end of the 6-weeks follow-up. Results: The results of the study demonstrated significant benefits from the use of the techniques in the psychological state of the pregnant women. The systematic implementation of the proposed relaxation techniques contributed in the reduction of perceived stress (mean change -3.23, 95% CI: -4.29 to -0.29) and increased the sense of control (mean change 1.99, 95% CI: 0.02-3.7). Conclusion: The findings suggest beneficial effects of relaxation on reducing perceived stress as well as increment of sense of control in pregnant women. The results of this study support the claim that training in the proposed relaxation techniques may constitute an ideal, non-pharmaceutical, intervention that can promote well-being, at least during pregnancy. Longer studies will be necessary in the future, in order to examine the long-term effects of relaxation techniques.

1753,The Association of Work Characteristics with Ovarian Cancer Risk and Mortality,"Objective Ovarian cancer (OvCA) is a leading cause of cancer death for women. Depression and social isolation have been associated with a higher OvCA risk and poorer survival, but other forms of chronic psychosocial stress, including work-related characteristics, remain understudied. Methods Women from three prospective cohorts (Nurses' Health Study: n = 31,754; Nurses' Health Study II: n = 74,260; Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study: nnested case-control study = 196) completed a job questionnaire, assessing demand and control at work, social support provided by coworkers and supervisor, and job security. Multivariate Cox and conditional logistic regression models estimated hazard ratios (Nurses' Health Study/Nurses' Health Study II) and odd ratios (Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study) of OvCA risk and mortality among cases. Random coefficient models were used for meta-Analyses. Results There were 396 OvCA cases and 186 deaths during follow-up. Overall, job strain, strain chronicity, social support, and job security were not significantly associated with OvCA risk (e.g., pooled relative risk [RR]high demand/low control = 1.06, confidence interval [CI] = 0.72-1.55) or mortality (e.g., pooled RRhigh demand/low control = 1.08, CI = 0.64-1.82). When considered individually, compared with low levels, only moderate levels of demand were associated with a reduced OvCA risk (pooled RR = 0.66, CI = 0.49-0.90). Social support provided by the coworker or the supervisor did not moderate the association of job strain with either OvCA risk or overall mortality. Conclusions We did not observe clear associations between work characteristics and OvCA incidence or mortality, but further research with diverse populations is warranted.

1754,"Short-term impact of a stress management and health promotion program on perceived stress, parental stress, health locus of control, and cortisol levels in parents of children and adolescents with diabetes type 1: A pilot randomized controlled trial","Background Parents of children and adolescents with diabetes type 1 (DT1) usually experience high stress levels, as they have to cope with multiple demands in their everyday life. Different complex interventions have been implemented, which sometimes have led to opposite results. Objective The purpose of this study was to assess stress levels in parents of children and adolescents with DT1 and to evaluate the effectiveness of a stress management program (progressive muscle relaxation combined with diaphragmatic breathing) in reducing perceived and parenting stress, increasing internal locus of control, promoting healthy lifestyle, and normalizing cortisol levels. Study Design Randomized controlled trial. Methods A total of 44 parents were randomly assigned to the intervention group (performing relaxation for eight weeks, n = 19) and control group (n = 25). Pre-post measurements included cortisol levels, lifestyle characteristics, perceived stress, perception of health, and parenting stress. Results A statistically significant decrease in perceived stress (from 27.21 to 19.00, P =.001), as well as in parenting stress (from 85.79 to 73.68, P =.003), was observed in the intervention group. A statistically significant difference was found in perceived stress between the two groups after the intervention (Dmean = 6.64, P =.010). No significant difference was revealed between or within the groups in cortisol levels. Significant improvement was reported by the subjects of the intervention group in various lifestyle parameters. Conclusions Relaxation techniques seem to have a positive impact on stress and on various lifestyle factors in parents of children and adolescents with DT1. Future research on long-term benefits of an intervention program comprising of various relaxation schemes is warranted.

1756,IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ADJUNCT STRATEGY TO REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE IN BLACKS WITH UNCONTROLLED HYPERTENSION: A PILOT PROJECT,"A high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension among Blacks is a major cause of racial health disparities in the United States. We established a community/academic partnership to improve hypertension control in Blacks receiving medical care at a federally qualified health center in Milwaukee. The defining components of our program included: six group sessions (one/month), based on the American Heart Association's Simple Seven curriculum and designed to motivate and empower patients to manage their blood pressure; active involvement of a community health worker; and ongoing participation of a community advisory board. The study design included a matched control group not exposed to the intervention. Patients in both groups received their usual medical care. Overall, compared to baseline, systolic blood pressure decreased at both 6 and 12 months (P < 0.004); however, the reduction of blood pressure in the intervention and control groups did not differ significantly (P=.62). Based on written responses to a questionnaire and structured focus group interviews after completing the six-month program, participants reported that the intervention was effective. In retrospect, they suggested that more attention might have been given to spirituality and stress reduction. Larger and longer term studies will be required to evaluate the added value of this type of intervention.","Tully, Madelaine; Kos, Allison; Eastwood, Daniel; Kusch, Jennifer; Kotchen, Theodore",0,,1345
1759,A randomised trial of a psychosocial intervention for cancer patients integrated into routine care: the PROMPT study (promoting optimal outcomes in mood through tailored psychosocial therapies),"Background: Despite evidence that up to 35% of patients with cancer experience significant distress, access to effective psychosocial care is limited by lack of systematic approaches to assessment, a paucity of psychosocial services, and patient reluctance to accept treatment either because of perceived stigma or difficulties with access to specialist psycho-oncology services due to isolation or disease burden. This paper presents an overview of a randomised study to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief tailored psychosocial Intervention delivered by health professionals in cancer care who undergo focused training and participate in clinical supervision.Methods/design: Health professionals from the disciplines of nursing, occupational therapy, speech pathology, dietetics, physiotherapy or radiation therapy will participate in training to deliver the psychosocial Intervention focusing on core concepts of supportive-expressive, cognitive and dignity-conserving care. Health professional training will consist of completion of a self-directed manual and participation in a skills development session. Participating health professionals will be supported through structured clinical supervision whilst delivering the Intervention. In the stepped wedge design each of the 5 participating clinical sites will be allocated in random order from Control condition to Training then delivery of the Intervention. A total of 600 patients will be recruited across all sites. Based on level of distress or risk factors eligible patients will receive up to 4 sessions, each of up to 30 minutes in length, delivered face-to-face or by telephone. Participants will be assessed at baseline and 10-week follow-up. Patient outcome measures include anxiety and depression, quality of life, unmet psychological and supportive care needs. Health professional measures include psychological morbidity, stress and burnout. Process evaluation will be conducted to assess perceptions of participation in the study and the factors that may promote translation of learning into practice.Discussion: This study will provide important information about the effectiveness of a brief tailored psychological Intervention for patients with cancer and the potential to prevent development of significant distress in patients considered at risk. It will yield data about the feasibility of this model of care in routine clinical practice and identify enablers and barriers to its systematic implementation in cancer settings.","Turner, Jane; Kelly, Brian; Clarke, David; Yates, Patsy; Aranda, Sanchia; Jolley, Damien; Chambers, Suzanne; Hargraves, Maryanne; McFadyen, Lisa",0,10.1186/1471-2407-11-48,1346
1760,Supporting oncology health professionals: A review,"Background: Caring for patients with cancer can be both personally rewarding and stressful. Confrontation with suffering, working with people facing complex life-threatening illness, demanding treatment regimens and frequent death of patients are challenging for many clinicians. Responding to the emotional needs of patients and families is often perceived as among the most stressful. These emotional sources of stress can be compounded by organisational factors and work demands. The resulting emotional impact can have an adverse effect on clinicians' performance in and satisfaction with their professional roles, their own health and well-being and the quality of patient care. Objective: The objective of this paper was to review the factors contributing to emotional stress and burnout in health professionals and identify evidence-based strategies to support health professionals in their role, with illustrations of current Australian initiatives on how to apply these in clinical practice. Results: Research to date indicates the contribution of a combination of individual and contextual factors in the development of these emotional adjustment problems, reflecting an interaction of clinicians' personal attributes and aspects of their work that influence risk to such stress and ""burnout"" among cancer clinicians. Evidence-based strategies to address these problems and promote resilience among clinicians include skills development through training and mentorship, particularly in communication skills and psychosocial care. Such training and mentorship can lead to improvements in clinicians' stress management and confidence in their role, as well as to patient outcomes through improved response to patients' concerns and suffering. Conclusion: No single strategy is likely to be successful in alleviating stress related to work in oncology. Interventions must be multi-faceted, flexible and incorporate attention to the complex inter-relationships of clinicians, their personality and experiences, patients and health care systems. Mentorship and clinical supervision can provide personal support, maintenance of skills and promote reflective practices and translation of these skills into everyday practice. Service models that also reduce professional isolation and promote inter-disciplinary team function are discussed, with illustrations of current initiatives in Australia.

1761,E-mailed standardized cognitive behavioural treatment of work-related stress: A randomized controlled trial,"The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a 7-week standardized cognitive behavioural treatment of work-related stress conducted via e-mail. A total of 342 people applied for treatment in reaction to a newspaper article. Initial screening reduced the sample to a heterogeneous (sub)clinical group of 239 participants. Participants were assigned randomly to a waiting list condition (n=62), or to immediate treatment (n=177). A follow-up was conducted 3 years after inception of the treatment. The outcome measures used were the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-42) and the Emotional Exhaustion scale of the Maslach Burnout Inventory - General Survey (MBI-GS). Fifty participants (21%) dropped out. Both groups showed statistically significant improvements. Intention-to-treat analysis of covariance (ANCOVAs) revealed that participants in the treatment condition improved significantly more than those in the waiting control condition (0.001 < p â‰¤ 0.025). In the treatment group, the effects were large to moderate (0.9 (stress)â‰¥dâ‰¥0.5 (anxiety)). The between-group effects ranged from d=0.6 (stress) to d=0.1 (anxiety). At follow-up, the effects were more pronounced, but this result requires replication in view of high attrition at follow-up. The results warrant further research on Internet-driven standardized cognitive behavioural therapy for work-related stress. Such research should include the direct comparison of this treatment with face-to-face treatment, and should address the optimal level of therapist contact in Internet-driven treatment.","Ruwaard J., Lange A., Bouwman M., Broeksteeg J., Schrieken B.",1,10.1080/16506070701381863,1348
1763,Supporting preterm infant attachment and socioemotional development in the neonatal intensive care unit: Staff perceptions,"The infant-parent relationship has been shown to be of particular significance to preterm infant socioemotional development. Supporting parents and infants in this process of developing their relationships is an integral part of neonatal intensive care; however, there is limited knowledge of NICU staff perceptions about this aspect of care. To explore NICU staff perceptions about attachment and socioemotional development of preterm infants, experience of training in this area and the emotional impact of their work. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of staff perceptions of the emotional experiences of parents and the developing parent-infant relationship in an NICU was conducted in a Level III NICU, after pilot testing, revision, and ethical approval. Fifty-seven (68%) of NICU staff responded to the survey. Respondents identified parents' emotional experiences such as ""anxiety,"" ""shock,"" ""loss of control,"" and ""lack of feelings of competence as parents"" as highly prevalent. Infant cues of ""responding to parent's voice"" and ""quieting-alerting"" were ranked most highly; ""crying"" and ""physiological changes"" were ranked lowest. Preterm infant medical risk, maternal emotional state, and mental health are perceived to impact most highly on the developing relationship, as compared with infant state or behavior and socioeconomic factors. Fifty-three (93%) respondents felt confident, and 50 (87.8%) felt competent discussing their emotional experiences with parents. Fifty-four (95%) responded that attending to these areas was an integral part of their role; however, staff had seldom received education in this area. Respondents also perceived that specific psychological support for parents was lacking both during and after the infant's discharge. While all staff surveyed perceived the nature of their work to be emotionally stressful, there were differences among NICU staff disciplines and with years of experience in the NICU in terms of their perceptions about education in this area, the place of supervision for staff, and in relation to opportunities to discuss the emotional impact of the work on staff. NICU staff perceive their role as integral to supporting the developing parent-infant relationship and preterm infant socioemotional development; however, education in this area and provision of specific psychological support are lacking. Opportunities for staff to discuss and reflect on this aspect of their work should be developed and evaluated given the essential, but emotionally challenging, nature of their work with preterm babies and their parents.

Early assessment of possible painful conditions can be made at the time of physical examination in those who are unable to give a history. Non-verbal signs of pain, including withdrawal of a painful limb or body part, irritability or tears should draw the attention of the assessing physician to a peripheral painful site. Treatment of conditions giving rise to pain can be made at this stage. Persistent pain may arise from a combination of physical and psychological factors and is best managed in a multidisciplinary pain clinic. Contributions from physicians in pain management, psychologists, physiotherapists and clinical nurse specialists enable a rehabilitation programme to take place. Treatments include analgesic drugs, graded exercise, cognitive-behavioural therapy, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.

This symposium comprised research presentations by four neuroscientists whose work focuses on the biological bases for complex interactions among stress, food intake and emotion. First, Dr Ulrich-Lai describes her rodent research exploring mechanisms by which the rewarding properties of sweet palatable foods confer stress relief. Second, Dr Stephanie Fulton discusses her work in which excessive, long-term intake of dietary lipids, as well as their subsequent withdrawal, promotes stress-related outcomes in mice. Third, Dr Mark Wilson describes his groups research examining the effects of social hierarchy-related stress on food intake and diet choice in group-housed female rhesus macaques, and compared the data from monkeys to results obtained in analogous work using rodents. Finally, Dr Gorica Petrovich discusses her research program that is aimed at defining cortical-amygdalar-hypothalamic circuitry responsible for curbing food intake during emotional threat (i.e. fear anticipation) in rats. Their collective results reveal the complexity of physiological and behavioral interactions that link stress, food intake and emotional state, and suggest new avenues of research to probe the impact of genetic, metabolic, social, experiential and environmental factors on these interactions.

1767,A Review of the Research Literature on Evidence-Based Healthcare Design,"Objective: This report surveys and evaluates the scientific research on evidence-based healthcare design and extracts its implications for designing better and safer hospitals.Background: It builds on a literature review conducted by researchers in 2004.Methods: Research teams conducted a new and more exhaustive search for rigorous empirical studies that link the design of hospital physical environments with healthcare outcomes. The review followed a two-step process, including an extensive search for existing literature, and a screening of each identified study for the relevance and quality of evidence.Results: This review found a growing body of rigorous studies to guide healthcare design, especially with respect to reducing the frequency of hospital-acquired infections. Results are organized according to three general types of outcomes: patient safety, other patient outcomes, and staff outcomes. The findings further support the importance of improving outcomes for a range of design characteristics or interventions, including single-bed rooms rather than multibed rooms, effective ventilation systems, a good acoustic environment, nature distractions and daylight, appropriate lighting, better ergonomic design, acuity-adaptable rooms, and improved floor layouts and work settings. Directions for future research are also identified.Conclusions: The state of knowledge of evidence-based healthcare design has grown rapidly in recent years. The evidence indicates that well-designed physical settings play an important role in making hospitals safer and more healing for patients, and better places for staff to work.","Ulrich, Roger S.; Zimring, Craig; Zhu, Xuemei; DuBose, Jennifer; Seo, Hyun-Bo; Choi, Young-Seon; Quan, Xiaobo; Joseph, Anjali",0,10.1177/193758670800100306,1353
1768,Annual research review: What is resilience within the social ecology of human development?,"Background: The development of Bronfenbrenner's bio-social-ecological systems model of human development parallels advances made to the theory of resilience that progressively moved from a more individual (micro) focus on traits to a multisystemic understanding of person-environment reciprocal processes. Methods: This review uses Bronfenbrenner's model and Ungar's social-ecological interpretation of four decades of research on resilience to discuss the results of a purposeful selection of studies of resilience that have been done in different contexts and cultures. Results: An ecological model of resilience can, and indeed has been shown to help researchers of resilience to conceptualize the child's social and physical ecologies, from caregivers to neighbourhoods, that account for both proximal and distal factors that predict successful development under adversity. Three principles emerged from this review that inform a bio-social-ecological interpretation of resilience: equifinality (there are many proximal processes that can lead to many different, but equally viable, expressions of human development associated with well-being); differential impact (the nature of the risks children face, their perceptions of the resources available to mitigate those risks and the quality of the resources that are accessible make proximal processes more or less influential to children's development); and contextual and cultural moderation (different contexts and cultures provide access to different processes associated with resilience as it is defined locally). Conclusion: As this review shows, using this multisystemic social-ecological theory of resilience can inform a deeper understanding of the processes that contribute to positive development under stress. It can also offer practitioners and policy makers a broader perspective on principles for the design and implementation of effective interventions. Â© 2012 The Authors.

1770,"Web-based stress management for newly diagnosed patients with cancer (STREAM): A randomized, wait-list controlled intervention study","Purpose: Being diagnosed with cancer causes major psychological distress; however, a majority of patients lack psychological support during this critical period. Internet interventions help patients overcome many barriers to seeking face-to-face support and may thus close this gap. We assessed feasibility and efficacy of Web-based stress management (STREAM [Stress-Aktiv-Mindern]) for newly diagnosed patients with cancer. Patients and Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, patients with cancer who had started first-line treatment within the previous 12 weeks were randomly assigned to a therapist-guided Web-based intervention or a waitlist (control), stratified according to distress level (â‰¥ 5 v > 5 on scale of 0 to 10). Primary efficacy end point was quality of life after the intervention (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue). Secondary end points included distress (Distress Thermometer) and anxiety or depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Treatment effect was assessed with analyses of covariance, adjusted for baseline distress. Results: A total of 222 of 229 screened patients applied online for participation. Between September 2014 and November 2016, 129 newly diagnosed patients with cancer, including 92 women treated for breast cancer, were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 65) or control (n = 64) group. Adherence was good, with 80.0% of patients using â‰¥ six of eight modules. Psychologists spent 13.3 minutes per week (interquartile range, 9.5-17.9 minutes per week) per patient for online guidance. After the intervention, quality of life was significantly higher (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue: mean, 8.59 points; 95% CI, 2.45 to 14.73 points; P = .007) and distress significantly lower (Distress Thermometer: mean, 20.85; 95% CI, 21.60 to 20.10; P = .03) in the intervention group as compared with the control.

Methods 93 pregnant women with PTL (gestational age 18â€“32) were assigned to either the IB-CBSM (n = 50) or a control group (CG) based on distraction (n = 43). Participants in both groups worked through six weekly modules. Birth outcome measures included gestational age, neonatal weight and length at birth and the rate of preterm birth (PTB). Questionnaires assessed psychological wellbeing and the activity of the HPA-axis was measured with the cortisol awakening reaction (CAR), both before (T1) and after the intervention (T2). Results Birth outcome and psychological wellbeing did not differ between IB-CBSM and CG. However, psychological wellbeing was higher after both interventions (PSS: Î·p 2 = 0.455, STAIX1: Î·p 2 = 0.455, STAIX2: Î·p 2 = 0.936, PRAT: Î·p 2 = 0.465, EPDS: Î·p 2 = 0.856). Cortisol levels were stable and did not alter differently between groups from T1 to T2. Higher cortisol levels were associated with lower gestational age at birth, whereas no significant correlations were found between weight and length at birth. Conclusions Although there were no significant differences between the two groups and birth outcome, psychological and biological parameters, both interventions (CBSM and CG) showed equivalent effects and proved to be beneficial with regard to psychosocial distress and well-being. Further research is needed to investigate CBSM and distraction interventions for pregnant women at risk for PTB together with a non-intervention control condition.

1772,Worksite stress management: A comparison of programs,"The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of commonly used approaches to stress management, delivered at worksites. Seventy-six volunteer employees were randomized to a relaxation training group, a multicomponent stress management group, or an education/social support group. Measures were collected at baseline, after the eight-week intervention, and at a three-month follow-up. There were significant reductions in anxiety, depression and hostility, which were maintained in all conditions. No group improved significantly on job satisfaction, work stress, resting BP, or BP reactivity to mental arithmetic or cold pressor stressors. There was no evidence that one group was more effective than the others. Psychological benefits may have been due to nonspecific intervention factors. While decreases in hostility may be a health-related benefit for all groups, it may be unrealistic to expect physiological improvements from clinical stress management programs with nonclinical employee populations.

1773,"Caring for the Caregivers: Results of an Extended, Five-component Stress-reduction Intervention for Hospital Staff","The health-related consequences of stress in hospital workers and associated costs of absenteeism and high turnover have increased the need for programs targeting stress in this population. â€œCaring for the Caregivers,â€ a multimodal approach to stress-reduction designed to address the multidimensional nature of stress in hospital staff, integrates five components: cognitive, somatic, dynamic, emotive and hands-on, in a flexible eight-month format. Significant improvements were demonstrated for 97 participants compared to 67 controls in preâ€“post scores for the Maslach Burnout Inventory, Job-Related Tension Index, Perceived Stress Scale, Productivity Scale, General Health Questionnaire, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, and Visual Analogue Scales of 12 stress-associated symptoms. Together with significant reduction in upper respiratory infections and family doctor visits, these results suggest that providing hospital staff with multiple techniques addressing commonly encountered work stressors impacts positively on health and well-being and significantly reduces stress and burnout in this population.

1774,Impact of a prenatal cognitive-behavioral stress management intervention on salivary cortisol levels in low-income mothers and their infants,"Recent findings suggest that elevated stress levels during the pre- and postpartum period are related to poor maternal and infant health outcomes; yet, few studies have prospectively examined the efficacy of stress management interventions on regulating stress levels among mothers and their infants. The current study examined whether a prenatal cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention would be effective in regulating salivary cortisol (a biological marker of stress) and self-reported stress levels among mothers and their infants at six and 18 months postpartum, relative to two control groups. Our sample was comprised of predominantly Spanish-speaking, low-income women (80%; mean age = 25 Â± 5 years) who were screened for depression during their second trimester of pregnancy (M= 16 Â± 5 weeks of gestation). Women at high risk for depression [i.e., having either a past history of major depression or current elevated symptoms of depression (â‰¥16 on CES-D)] were randomized to either a CBSM group (n= 24) or a usual care (UC) group (n= 33), while a low risk comparison (LRC) group (n= 29) was comprised of women not meeting either depression criteria. ANCOVA analyses demonstrated that: (1) infants of women in the CBSM and LRC groups had significantly lower cortisol levels than infants of women in the UC group at six months postpartum (p< .001); and (2) women in the CBSM group had lower cortisol levels than women in the UC group at 18 months postpartum (p< .01). These results suggest that prenatal CBSM interventions may be efficacious in regulating biological markers of stress among mothers and their infants, thereby decreasing their risk for developing health complications over time.

From the common sense coping concept formulated by Seymour Levine; coping is when my "" tommy"" does not hurt, we have advanced to a systematic theory for what is behind the relaxed and happy coping rat (and cat). We also cover the translational leap to humans, starting with the now classic parachutist study. The bridge is based on formal and symbolic definitions, a theoretical short cut that Levine actually never really accepted. The essential pathophysiological concept is the potential pathological effects of sustained activation, which may occur in the absence of coping (positive response outcome expectancy).

1776,Brief cognitive-behavioral therapy with fibromyalgia patients in routine care,"Objective: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) group intervention for fibromyalgia syndrome in routine care. Method: Thirty-four female outpatients who participated in a 5- to 6-week group CBT program were assessed for depression (Beck Depression Inventory), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), coping strategies (Coping Questionnaire for Chronic Pain), physical functioning (Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), and somatization (Health Attitude Survey) at 3 time points (baseline, pretreatment, and posttreatment) using a pre-post, quasi-experimental design. Results: Twenty-three female outpatients (68% of the initial sample) for which data were available in all 3 time points were included in the analyses. No changes were found during the waiting period. During the treatment period, there were significant reductions in depression (P = .001) and anxiety (P = .006) symptoms and an increased use of distraction skills (P < .001). The analysis of rate of change showed a significant correlation between anxiety and depression (P = .004), but not between these variables and the use of distraction as a coping strategy. Conclusion: Brief group CBT is effective in reducing emotional distress in female patients with long-standing fibromyalgia syndrome in the context of routine care. Attention-distraction skills appear to be amenable to change by means of brief CBT, but further research is needed to clarify their contribution to short-term clinical improvement.

This scale measures stress at terrorism-prevention work, past stress during combat exposure, and subjects' most stressful life events. Results support the hypothesis that terrorism prevention personnel who are also combat veterans appraise their work as less stressful than their noncombat exposed counterparts. Combat veterans also rated their combat experience as significantly more stressful than prevention team member's other stressful life events.

This study assessed the work environment and impact of providing a behavioral risk reduction intervention in six community health centers (CHCs) in Lusaka, Zambia; opportunities and challenges to long-term program sustainability were identified. CHC staff participants (n = 82) were assessed on perceived clinic burden, job satisfaction, and burnout before and after implementation of the intervention. High levels of clinic burden were identified; however, no increase in perceived clinic burden or staff burnout was associated with providing the intervention. The intervention was sustained at the majority of CHCs and also adopted at additional clinics. Behavioral interventions can be successfully implemented and maintained in resource-poor settings. Creative strategies to overcome structural and economic challenges should be applied to enhance translation research.

1782,A psychomotor diagnostic instrument for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with an increased risk of physical disorders as a consequence of chronic stress reactions and adverse lifestyle behaviours. In addition, various other physical signs and symptoms may be present, as well as problems with emotional awareness, such as alexithymia, which may impede verbal information processing. Therefore, a psychomotor diagnostic instrument (PMDI) is developed, based on non-verbal information to contribute to a careful and reliable diagnostic procedure. The PDMI is designed to identify specific goals for body and movement oriented treatments of PTSD. It consists of a manual with an assessment procedure, guidelines for scoring items and for the calculation of cluster scores based on item scores. In this paper, the PMDI and its development are discussed, and illustrated by brief vignettes.

There was strong evidence for one intervention category, resistance training, leading to the recommendation: Implementing a workplace-based resistance training exercise programme can help prevent and manage UEMSD and symptoms. The synthesis also revealed moderate evidence for stretching programmes, mouse use feedback and forearm supports in preventing UEMSD or symptoms. There was also moderate evidence for no benefit for EMG biofeedback, job stress management training, and office workstation adjustment for UEMSD and symptoms. Messages are proposed for both these and other intervention categories.","Van Eerd, D.; Munhall, C.; Irvin, E.; Rempel, D.; Brewer, S.; Van der Beek, A. J.; Dennerlein, J.

1789,The effects of Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT) on healthcare workers,"Background: The main objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of the Compassion Cultivation Training (CCT) on various aspects of burnout and job satisfaction in health-care workers. Specifically, this study sought to investigate whether CCT reduces work-related burnout, interpersonal conflict, as well as increases of mindfulness, compassion toward the self, fears of compassion, and job satisfaction scores.Method: Participants consisted of 62 adults, who identified as health-care workers between the ages 22 and 80. All participants completed an 8-week CCT course and filled out questionnaires related to self-compassion, fears of compassion, mindfulness, burnout, job satisfaction, and interpersonal conflict. The questionnaires were administered by email during the first, middle, and last weeks of CCT, as well as 1 month after completion of CCT (follow-up).Results: The results for this study demonstrated significant improvements in participants' self-compassion, mindfulness, and interpersonal conflict scores. In addition, the results indicated marginally significant improvements in self-reported job satisfaction scores. No differences were observed on the burnout measure due to possible floor effects.Conclusions: The general conclusions of this study are that CCT may be helpful at improving several aspects of health in health-care providers, such as self-reported mindfulness, self-compassion, compassion toward others, and interpersonal conflict. The implications of this study are that this training may promote mental health resilience in health-care workers, improve patient care, and may be helpful in burnout prevention. Further implications and future directions are discussed.","Scarlet, Janina; Altmeyer, Nathanael; Knier, Susan; Harpin, R. Edward",1,10.1111/cp.12130,1375

A two phase approach was used. In phase one, all randomised controlled trials included in the systematic review of Dawson et al. (2007) which reviewed interventions for low back pain in nurses until 2004 were selected. In phase two, relevant randomised controlled trials and cluster randomised controlled trials published from 2004 until December 2015 were identified by an electronic search of nine databases (Embase, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, PsycARTICLES, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PEDro, Scopus and MEDLINE). To be eligible, trials had to examine the efficacy of interventions either for the prevention or treatment of low back pain in nurses. Primary outcomes of interest were any measure of pain and/or disability.Review methods: Three reviewers independently assessed eligibility and two reviewers independently conducted a risk of bias assessment (Cochrane Back and Neck Group).Results: Four studies were retrieved from phase one. In phase two, 15,628 titles and abstracts were scanned. From these, 150 full-text studies were retrieved and ten were eligible. Fourteen studies (four from phase one, ten from phase two) were eligible for risk of bias assessment. The included trials were highly heterogeneous, differing in pain and disability outcome measures, types of intervention, types of control group and follow-up durations. Only four of the included studies ( n = 644 subjects) had a low risk of bias (>= 6/12). Manual handling training and stress management in isolation were not effective in nurses with and without low back pain (risk of bias, 7/12, n = 210); the addition of a stretching exercise intervention was better than only performing usual activities (risk of bias, 6/12, n = 127); combining manual handling training and back school was better than passive physiotherapy (risk of bias, 7/12, n = 124); and a multidimensional intervention (risk of bias, 7/12, n = 183) was not superior to a general exercise program in reducing low back pain in nurses.Conclusions: Only four relevant low risk of bias randomised controlled trials were found. At present there is no strong evidence of efficacy for any intervention in preventing or treating low back pain in nurses. Additional high quality randomised controlled trials are required. It may be worth exploring the efficacy of more individualised multidimensional interventions for low back pain in the nursing population.","Van Hoof, Wannes; O'Sullivan, Kieran; O'Keeffe, Mary; Verschueren, Sabine; O'Sullivan, Peter; Dankaerts, Wim",0,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2017.10.015,1376
1791,A controlled study into the (cognitive) effects of exposure treatment on trauma therapists,"Several researchers have reported on therapists' symptoms as a result of trauma treatment, such as disruptions in cognitive schemata and symptoms resembling PTSD-symptoms. Thus far, however, no studies compared the symptoms of trauma therapists and non-trauma therapists. In the present study, both trauma therapists (n=20) and non-trauma therapists (n=19) were included. During semi-structured interviews, both therapist groups reported negative and positive effects of their work with patients on their personal and professional functioning. Trauma therapists reported more often changes of cognitions due to trauma work. Results from questionnaires, however, showed that compared with norm-standards and compared with non-trauma therapists, trauma therapists did not show enhanced psychopathology nor distorted cognitive schemata. It is concluded that although exposure treatments with trauma patients are associated with therapists' distress, therapists seem able to cope with it in a healthy way.

1792,Effectiveness of respite care in supporting informal caregivers of persons with dementia: a systematic review,"ObjectiveSupporting informal caregivers of persons with dementia is considered to be an effective strategy for improving the well-being of caregivers and care recipients and for delaying nursing home placement. Although considerable research has been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of psychoeducational interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy, and occupational therapy, research into the effectiveness of respite care is rare. This systematic review aims to investigate the effectiveness of different types of respite care in supporting informal caregivers of persons with dementia.MethodsA systematic literature search was conducted using Web of Science and PubMed, and the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies was used to assess the methodological quality. Randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, pretest-posttest studies without a control group, and cohort studies were included.ResultsSeventeen papers met the inclusion criteria. Day care services are effective in decreasing caregiver burden and behavioral problems in persons with dementia, but they also accelerate time to nursing home admission. The results of temporary residential admission are rather mixed and show unexpected adverse effects on both caregivers and care recipients. High-quality comparable evidence on community-based respite care is still lacking, although earlier qualitative evidence indicated promising results.ConclusionUnlike in previous reviews, we were able to draw some conclusions about the effectiveness of some types of respite care. There is nonetheless still a need for new intervention studies measuring the impact of respite care, especially in-home respite care programs, on the caregiver, the care recipient, and health care resource utilization.

1793,Transfer of follow-up care to family physicians for early-stage breast cancer,"Aims: As a result of the rising prevalence of breast cancer and improved adjuvant treatment strategies, oncologists are faced with an ever-increasing workload of providing long-term follow-up care for early-stage breast cancer patients. In order to cope with these growing demands, innovative follow-up strategies are urgently required. Materials and methods: To explore if patient transfer back to the family physician for follow-up was a potential option, a prospective programme of planned discharge was established for all patients who had completed adjuvant chemo/ radiotherapy or had started adjuvant endocrine therapy. Patient and family physician information packages were also provided. Results: Between April and August 2005, of the 193 patients assessed for transfer back to the family physician for follow-up care, transfer was possible in 43%. Fifty-seven per cent (or 110 patients) were unsuitable for transfer back to the family physician. The reasons cited among those deemed unsuitable for transfer were as follows: clinical trial enrolment (50.9%), ongoing endocrine treatment (31.8%), new symptoms (6.3%), and patient refusal (0.9%). In both discharged and non-discharged groups, patients were also frequently being followed by other oncologists (surgical and/or radiation). Conclusion: Transfer of care back to family physicians for follow-up may offer a strategy to control workload volumes, and thus enable oncologists to focus their efforts on newly diagnosed and advanced-stage patients with more complex patient care needs.","Vanhuyse, M.; Bedard, P.

1794,Are Work Disability Prevention Interventions Effective for the Management of Neck Pain or Upper Extremity Disorders? A Systematic Review by the Ontario Protocol for Traffic Injury Management (OPTIMa) Collaboration,"Purpose We conducted a systematic review to critically appraise and synthesize literature on the effectiveness of work disability prevention (WDP) interventions in workers with neck pain, whiplash-associated disorders (WAD), or upper extremity disorders. Methods We searched electronic databases from 1990 to 2012. Random pairs of independent reviewers critically appraised eligible studies using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. Scientifically admissible studies were summarized and synthesized following best-evidence synthesis methodology. Results Of the 6,359 articles retrieved, 16 randomized controlled trials were eligible for critical appraisal and five were admissible. We found that a return-to-work coordination program (including workplace-based work hardening) was superior to clinic-based work hardening for persistent rotator cuff tendinitis. Workplace high-intensity strength training and workplace advice had similar outcomes for neck and shoulder pain. Mensendieck/Cesar postural exercises and strength and fitness exercises had similar outcomes for non-specific work-related upper limb complaints. Adding a brief job stress education program to a workplace ergonomic intervention was not beneficial for persistent upper extremity symptoms. Adding computer-prompted work breaks to ergonomic adjustments and workplace education benefited workers' recovery from recent work-related neck and upper extremity complaints. Conclusions At present, no firm conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of WDP interventions for managing neck pain, WAD, and upper extremity disorders. Our review suggests a return-to-work coordination program is more effective than clinic-based work hardening. Also, adding computer-prompted breaks to ergonomic and workplace interventions benefits workers' recovery. The current quality of evidence does not allow for a definitive evaluation of the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions.","Varatharajan, Sharanya; Cote, Pierre; Shearer, Heather M.; Loisel, Patrick; Wong, Jessica J.; Southerst, Danielle; Yu, Hainan; Randhawa, Kristi; Sutton, Deborah; van der Velde, Gabrielle; Mior, Silvano; Carroll, Linda J.; Jacobs, Craig; Taylor-Vaisey, Anne",0,10.1007/s10926-014-9501-1,1380
1797,Deployment-related mental health support: comparative analysis of NATO and allied ISAF partners,"Background: For years there has been a tremendous gap in our understanding of the mental health effects of deployment and the efforts by military forces at trying to minimize or mitigate these. Many military forces have recently systematized the mental support that is provided to support operational deployments. However, the rationale for doing so and the consequential allocation of resources are felt to vary considerably across North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) International Security Assistance (ISAF) partners. This review aims to compare the organization and practice of mental support by five partnering countries in the recent deployment in Afghanistan in order to identify and compare the key methods and structures for delivering mental health support, describe bottlenecks and illustrate new developments.Method: Information was collected through document analysis and semi-structured interviews with key military mental healthcare stakeholders. The review resulted from close collaboration between key military mental healthcare professionals within the Australian Defense Forces (ADF), Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), United Kingdom Armed Forces (UK), Netherlands Armed Forces (NLD), and the United States Army (US). Key stakeholders were interviewed about the mental health support provided during a serviceperson's military career. The main items discussed were training, prevention, early identification, intervention, and aftercare in the field of mental health.Results: All forces reported that much attention was paid to mental health during the individual's military career, including deployment. In doing so there was much overlap between the rationale and applied methods. The main method of providing support was through training and education. The educative focus was to strengthen the mental resilience of individual soldiers while providing a range of mental healthcare services. All forces had abandoned standard psychological debriefing after critical incidents. Instead, by default, mental healthcare professionals acted to support the leader and peer led ""after action'' reviews. All countries provided professional mental support close to the front line, aimed at early detection and early return to normal activities within the unit. All countries deployed a mental health support team that consisted of a range of mental health staff including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, mental health nurses, and chaplains. There was no overall consensus in the allocation of mental health disciplines in theatre. All countries (except the US) provided troops with a third location decompression (TLD) stop after deployment, which aimed to recognize what the deployed units had been through and to prepare them for transition home. The US conducted in-garrison 'decompression', or 'reintegration training' in the US, with a similiar focus to TLD. All had a reasonably comparable infrastructure in the field of mental healthcare. Shared bottlenecks across countries included perceived stigma and barriers to care around mental health problems as well as the need for improving the awareness and recognition of mental health problems among service members.Conclusion: This analysis demonstrated that in all five partners state-of-the-art preventative mental healthcare was included in the last deployment in Afghanistan, including a positive approach towards strengthening the mental resilience, a focus on self-regulatory skills and self-empowerment, and several initiatives that were well-integrated in a military context. These initiatives were partly/completely implemented by the military/colleagues/supervisors and applicable during several phases of the deployment cycle. Important new developments in operational mental health support are recognition of the role of social leadership and enhancement of operational peer support. This requires awareness of mental problems that will contribute to reduction of the barriers to care in case of problems. Finally, comparing mental health support services across countries can contribute to optimal preparation for the challenges of military deployment.","Vermetten, Eric; Greenberg, Neil; Boeschoten, Manon A.; Delahaije, Roos; Jetly, Rakesh; Castro, Carl A.; McFarlane, Alexander C.",0,10.3402/ejpt.v5.23732,1381
1798,Somatosensory Amplification Mediates Sex Differences in Psychological Distress Among Cardioverter-Defibrillator Patients,"Objective: The present study examined whether female patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) report more psychological distress than male patients, and whether somatosensory amplification mediates this relationship. Design: Consecutive ICD patients (N = 241; 33% women) participating in the Living with an Implanted Cardioverter-Defibrillator Study, completed a set of psychological questionnaires. Main Outcome Measures: Symptom Checklist-90 and Somatosensory Amplification Scale. Results: Univariable linear regression analyses showed that female ICD patients reported more symptoms of anxiety (Î² =13, p =04), phobic anxiety (Î² =13, p =05), and somatic health complaints (Î² =15, p =02), and scored higher on somatosensory amplification (Î² =24, p < 001) than men. Multivariable regression analyses, adjusted for demographic and clinical risk factors, revealed that somatosensory amplification was associated with more anxiety (Î² =48, p < 001), phobic anxiety (Î² =34, p < 001), and somatic health complaints (Î² =49, p < 001). Sobel tests indicated that somatosensory amplification mediated the association between sex and these three domains of psychological distress (p =0005, .002, and .0006, respectively). Conclusion: Somatosensory amplification mediated the relationship between female sex and heightened anxiety, phobic anxiety, and somatic health complaints in ICD patients. Women may be more likely to misinterpret bodily sensations as indicative of deterioration in their condition. Interventions focusing on modifying these dysfunctional beliefs may reduce their psychological distress.

1799,An e-health protocol to help elderly breast cancer patients to cope with chemotherapy: Preliminary results,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. The aging population increases the number of new diagnoses and several studies showed that women of all ages experience psychological stress for possible side effects. To prepare women over 60 years diagnosed with breast cancer to face the imminent chemotherapy we developed an e-SIT (Stress Inoculation Training) protocol lasting two weeks. The online protocol includes 10 sessions to see once a day and each session integrates two parts: a live-video interview with women who have gone through breast cancer experience and a guided relaxation and meditation experience. The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of the training, in addition to traditional treatment provided by the hospital, through a controlled trial with a control group without treatment. The effectiveness is assessed through self-report validated questionnaires aimed to evaluate womenâ€™s emotion regulation strategies and their adjustment to disease. Questionnaires are administered at the beginning and at the end of the training in two face-to-face meetings with the psychologist. At the moment 20 elderly women (M=64.5 years old) have been enrolled in the study. They are mostly married and not workers. Data show that both anxious preoccupation and fighting spirit increase more in women of the experimental group than in women of the control group. Thus, preliminary results suggest the activation of anticipatory coping and encourage to design and to develop future e-health interventions aimed to support elderly breast cancer patients in coping with chemotherapy and related side effects.

1800,Mastery and inoculation against setbacks as active ingredients in the JOBS intervention for the unemployed,"Earlier analyses of the JOBS II intervention for unemployed job seekers demonstrated that the intervention facilitated reemployment, reduced depressive symptoms, and improved role and emotional functioning (A. D. Vinokur, R. H. Price, and Y. Schul, 1995). The present study focuses on mediational processes of the active ingredients targeted by the intervention. Structural equation modeling analysis demonstrated that an enhanced sense of mastery had mediating effects on reemployment, financial strain, and reduction in depressive symptoms. Another active ingredient, inoculation against setbacks, was shown to protect those who suffered the setback of losing a job after temporarily regaining one. The inoculation protected them from experiencing the high level of depressive symptoms that was typical of their counterparts in the control group.","Vinokur A.D., Schul Y.",0,10.1037/0022-006X.65.5.867,1384

Feasibility was assessed by percentage of eligible patients, attrition and attendance rates, and patient satisfaction.Results: The developed CBT component seeks to decrease psychological distress and improve activities and participation across multiple life domains by accomplishing behavior change, acceptance, and coping flexibility. Motivational interviewing was applied to endorse patients' own reasons to change. Forty percent (35187) of the eligible patients were admitted to the program. Attendance rate (>95%) was high. Patient satisfaction ranged from 6.8 to 8.0 (10-point scale).Conclusion: Integrating CBT within a multimodal rehabilitation program is feasible. An acceptable proportion of the intended patient sample is eligible and patient's attendance and satisfaction is high.Practice implications: Patients with impaired physical and psychosocial functioning despite adequate medical treatment pose a great challenge. Their treatment outcome may be improved by screening and selecting highly distressed patients and offering them a CBT embedded in multimodal rehabilitation program. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1805,Nature based solution for improving mental health and well-being in urban areas,"The general disproportion of urban development and the socio-economical crisis in Serbia, followed by a number of acute and chronic stressors, as well as years of accumulated trauma, prevented the parallel physical, mental and social adaptation of society as a whole. These trends certainly affected the quality of mental health and wellbeing, particularly on the vulnerable urban population, increasing the absolute number of people with depression, stress and psychosomatic disorders. This study was pioneering in Serbia and was conducted in collaboration with the Faculty of Forestry, the Institute of Mental Health and the Botanical Garden in Belgrade, in order to understand how spending time and performing horticulture therapy in specially designed urban green environments can improve mental health. The participants were psychiatric patients (n = 30), users of the day hospital of the Institute who were randomly selected for the study, and the control group, assessed for depression, anxiety and stress before and after the intervention, using a DASS21 scale. During the intervention period the study group stayed in the Botanical garden and participated in a special programme of horticulture therapy. In order to exclude any possible ""special treatment"" or ""placebo effect"", the control group was included in occupational art therapy while it continued to receive conventional therapy. The test results indicated that nature based therapy had a positive influence on the mental health and well-being of the participants. Furthermore, the difference in the test results of the subscale stress before and after the intervention for the study group was F1.28 = 5.442 and p <;.05. According to socio demographic and clinical variables, the interesting trend was recorded on the subscale of anxiety showing that the male participants in the study group were more anxious, with the most pronounced inflection noted on this scale after treatment. The results of this study have shown that recuperation from stress, depression and anxiety was possible and much more complete when participants were involved in horticulture therapy as a nature-based solution for improving mental health.","Vujcic, Maja; Tomicevic-Dubljevic, Jelena; Grbic, Mihailo; Lecic-Tosevski, Dusica; Vukovic, Olivera; Toskovic, Oliver",0,10.1016/j.envres.2017.06.030,1386

1810,A randomized controlled trial to evaluate outcomes of a workplace self-management intervention and an intensive monitoring intervention,"The purpose of this study was to determine and compare outcomes of two voluntary workplace health management methods: an adapted worksite self-management (WSM) approach and an intensive health monitoring (IM) approach. Research participants were randomly assigned to either the WSM group or the IM group by a computer-generated list (n = 180; 92 WSM and 88 IM). Participants completed baseline, 3 and 12-month follow-up surveys. Individuals receiving workplace WSM and IM improved in self-efficacy and nearly all health behaviors and health status variables after the intervention, compared to before the intervention. Individuals in the WSM group improved in depression symptoms at 3 and 12 months (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001), and individuals in the IM group did not improve at either time period (P < 0.1488, P < 0.0521). Participants in the WSM group reported more improvement in physical activity and energy, health interfering less with personal life and daily activities and fewer depression symptoms at follow up, compared to participants in the IM group. This study provided additional support for worksite-based health promotion programs to promote healthy lifestyles and improve health status, and documented effectiveness of both methods, with superior performance and greater scalability for the WSM program.","Schopp, Laura H.; Clark, Mary J.; Lamberson, William R.; Uhr, David J.; Minor, Marian A.",1,10.1093/her/cyx042,1389

1813,Promotoras as Mental Health Practitioners in Primary Care: A Multi-Method Study of an Intervention to Address Contextual Sources of Depression,"We assessed the role of promotoras-briefly trained community health workers-in depression care at community health centers. The intervention focused on four contextual sources of depression in underserved, low-income communities: underemployment, inadequate housing, food insecurity, and violence. A multi-method design included quantitative and ethnographic techniques to study predictors of depression and the intervention's impact. After a structured training program, primary care practitioners (PCPs) and promotoras collaboratively followed a clinical algorithm in which PCPs prescribed medications and/or arranged consultations by mental health professionals and promotoras addressed the contextual sources of depression. Based on an intake interview with 464 randomly recruited patients, 120 patients with depression were randomized to enhanced care plus the promotora contextual intervention, or to enhanced care alone. All four contextual problems emerged as strong predictors of depression (chi square, p < .05); logistic regression revealed housing and food insecurity as the most important predictors (odds ratios both 2.40, p < .05). Unexpected challenges arose in the intervention's implementation, involving infrastructure at the health centers, boundaries of the promotoras' roles, and ""turf"" issues with medical assistants. In the quantitative assessment, the intervention did not lead to statistically significant improvements in depression (odds ratio 4.33, confidence interval overlapping 1). Ethnographic research demonstrated a predominantly positive response to the intervention among stakeholders, including patients, promotoras, PCPs, non-professional staff workers, administrators, and community advisory board members. Due to continuing unmet mental health needs, we favor further assessment of innovative roles for community health workers.","Waitzkin, Howard; Getrich, Christina; Heying, Shirley; Rodriguez, Laura; Parmar, Anita; Willging, Cathleen; Yager, Joel; Santos, Richard",0,10.1007/s10900-010-9313-y,1391
1814,The effect of sunlight on postoperative analgesic medication use: A prospective study of patients undergoing spinal surgery,"Objective: Exposure to natural sunlight has been associated with improvement in mood, reduced mortality among patients with cancer, and reduced length of hospitalization for patients who have experienced myocardial infarction. Our aim was to evaluate whether the amount of sunlight in a hospital room modifies a patient's psychosocial health, the quantity of analgesic medication used, and the pain medication cost. Methods: A prospective study of pain medication use was conducted in 89 patients undergoing elective cervical and lumbar spinal surgery where they were housed on either the ""bright"" or ""dim"" side of the same hospital unit. Analgesic medication was converted to standard morphine equivalents for interpatient comparison. The intensity of sunlight in each hospital room was measured daily and psychologic questionnaires were administered on the day after surgery and at discharge. Results: Patients staying on the bright side of the hospital unit were exposed to 46% higher-intensity sunlight on average (p = .005). Patients exposed to an increased intensity of sunlight experienced less perceived stress (p = .035), marginally less pain (p = .058), took 22% less analgesic medication per hour (p = .047), and had 21% less pain medication costs (p = .047). Age quartile was the only other variable found to be a predictor of analgesic use, with a significant negative correlation (p < .001). However, patients housed on the bright side of the hospital consistently used less analgesic medications in all age quartiles. Conclusion: The exposure postoperatively of patients who have undergone spinal surgery to increased amounts of natural sunlight during their hospital recovery period may result in decreased stress, pain, analgesic medication use, and pain medication costs.","Walch J.M., Rabin B.S., Day R., Williams J.N., Choi K., Kang J.D.",0,10.1097/01.psy.0000149258.42508.70,1392
1815,Cognitive behavioural and neuropsychiatric treatment of post-traumatic conversion disorder: A case study,"Conversion disorder consists of involuntary sensory or motor symptoms and deficits that cannot be explained by a general medical condition. There are several treatment options, although none has emerged as the treatment of choice. The present case study examined the effects of adding cognitive behaviour therapy to neuropsychiatric management of conversion disorder (motor subtype). The patient, a retired emergency services worker, presented with a history of intermittent episodes of speech disruption (inability to speak or difficulty speaking properly). Although episodes of speech disturbance sometimes occurred unexpectedly, they were more likely to occur under conditions of stress and fatigue, and were triggered by reminders of work-related traumatic events. The patient was treated with pharmacotherapy and psychoeducation from a neuropsychiatrist. With the aim of improving treatment outcome, cognitive behaviour therapy was added, involving imaginal exposure to trauma memories, along with cognitive restructuring. The frequency of between- and within-session speech disturbance episodes declined over the course of cognitive behaviour therapy to the point that the patient was essentially symptom-free. Within-session distress ratings also decreased, which suggested habituation to trauma-related memories. This case study demonstrates how particular cognitive behaviour therapy interventions can be usefully applied to one form of conversion disorder.

Method: From 2002 to 2004, expectant Al women aged 12 to 22 years (n = 167) were randomized (1:1) to one of two paraprofessional-delivered, home-visiting interventions: the 25-visit ""Family Spirit"" intervention addressing prenatal and newborn care and maternal life skills (treatment) or a 23-visit breast-feeding/nutrition education intervention (active control). The interventions began during pregnancy and continued to 6 months postpartum. Mothers and children were evaluated at baseline and 2,6, and 12 months postpartum. Primary outcomes included changes in mothers' parenting knowledge and involvement. Secondary outcomes included infants' social and emotional behavior; the home environment; and mothers' stress, social support, depression, and substance use. Results: Participants were mostly teenaged, first-time, unmarried mothers living in reservation communities. At 6 and 12 months postpartum, treatment mothers compared with control mothers had greater parenting knowledge gains, 13.5 (p< .0001) and 13.9 (p< .0001) points higher, respectively (100-point scale). At 12 months postpartum, treatment mothers reported their infants to have significantly lower scores on the externalizing domain (Î² = -.17, p < .05) and less separation distress in the internalizing domain (p = -.17, p < .05). No between-group differences were found for maternal involvement, home environment, or mothers' stress, social support, depression, or substance use.

1818,Medical cannabis and mental health: A guided systematic review,"This review considers the potential influences of the use of cannabis for therapeutic purposes (CTP) on areas of interest to mental health professionals, with foci on adult psychopathology and assessment. We identified 31 articles relating to the use of CTP and mental health, and 29 review articles on cannabis use and mental health that did not focus on use for therapeutic purposes. Results reflect the prominence of mental health conditions among the reasons for CTP use, and the relative dearth of high-quality evidence related to CTP in this context, thereby highlighting the need for further research into the harms and benefits of medical cannabis relative to other therapeutic options. Preliminary evidence suggests that CTP may have potential for the treatment of PTSD, and as a substitute for problematic use of other substances. Extrapolation from reviews of non-therapeutic cannabis use suggests that the use of CTP may be problematic among individuals with psychotic disorders. The clinical implications of CTP use among individuals with mood disorders are unclear. With regard to assessment, evidence suggests that CTP use does not increase risk of harm to self or others. Acute cannabis intoxication and recent CTP use may result in reversible deficits with the potential to influence cognitive assessment, particularly on tests of short-term memory.

1819,Chronic aluminum intake causes Alzheimer's disease: Applying sir austin bradford hill's causality criteria,"Industrialized societies produce many convenience foods with aluminum additives that enhance various food properties and use alum (aluminum sulfate or aluminum potassium sulfate) in water treatment to enable delivery of large volumes of drinking water to millions of urban consumers. The present causality analysis evaluates the extent to which the routine, life-long intake, and metabolism of aluminum compounds can account for Alzheimer's disease (AD), using Austin Bradford Hill's nine epidemiological and experimental causality criteria, including strength of the relationship, consistency, specificity, temporality, dose-dependent response, biological rationale, coherence with existing knowledge, experimental evidence, and analogy. Mechanisms that underlie the risk of low concentrations of aluminum relate to (1) aluminum's absorption rates, allowing the impression that aluminum is safe to ingest and as an additive in food and drinking water treatment, (2) aluminum's slow progressive uptake into the brain over a long prodromal phase, and (3) aluminum's similarity to iron, in terms of ionic size, allows aluminum to use iron-evolved mechanisms to enter the highly-active, iron-dependent cells responsible for memory processing. Aluminum particularly accumulates in these iron-dependent cells to toxic levels, dysregulating iron homeostasis and causing microtubule depletion, eventually producing changes that result in disconnection of neuronal afferents and efferents, loss of function and regional atrophy consistent with MRI findings in AD brains. AD is a human form of chronic aluminum neurotoxicity. The causality analysis demonstrates that chronic aluminum intake causes AD. Â© 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

1822,"Prevalence, risk factors, and the desire for help of distressed newly diagnosed cancer patients: A large-sample study","Objective: Beginning in 2007, all newly diagnosed cancer patients at the Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center (KF-SYSCC) were screened for psychosocial distress. Our social workers, as part of the psychosocial care team (PCT), have engaged in proactive outreach with patients identified as distressed. The goal of the present study was to assess the prevalence of psychosocial distress and the extent of contact between the PCT and distressed patients. Method: Newly diagnosed patients who were treated at KF-SYSCC between 2007 and 2010 for cancer were eligible if there were at least 100 patients with the same type of cancer. Before treatment began, they were screened with the Pain Scale and the Distress Thermometer (DT) and had the option to specify a desire for help. The rates of distress were analyzed by cancer type and by probable related factors. Information regarding contact with the PCT was retrieved from computerized databases. Results: Overall, some 5,335 cancer patients representing 12 major cancer types were included in our study. Of these, 1,771 (33.20%) were significantly distressed. By multivariate logistic regression, younger age, female gender, higher pain score, and disease stage, but not cancer type, were found to be associated with higher rates of distress. Among these distressed patients, 628 (36%) had some contact with the PCT. Significance of results: This Taiwanese study with a large sample size revealed a prevalence rate of psychosocial distress similar to rates found in Western countries. Contact with the PCT was established in only 36% of significantly distressed patients, despite a proactive outreach program. It is very important to have screening results made available in a timely fashion to the psycho-oncology team so that appropriate care can be offered promptly.

1826,Management and Prevention of Bone Stress Injuries in Long-Distance Runners,"SYNOPSIS: Bone stress injury (BSI) represents the inability of bone to withstand repetitive loading, which results in structural fatigue and localized bone pain and tenderness. A BSI occurs along a pathology continuum that begins with a stress reaction, which can progress to a stress fracture and, ultimately, a complete bone fracture. Bone stress injuries are a source of concern in long-distance runners, not only because of their frequency and the morbidity they cause but also because of their tendency to recur. While most BSIs readily heal following a period of modified loading and a progressive return to running activities, the high recurrence rate of BSIs signals a need to address their underlying causative factors. A BSI results from disruption of the homeostasis between microdamage formation and its removal. Microdamage accumulation and subsequent risk for development of a BSI are related both to the load applied to a bone and to the ability of the bone to resist load. The former is more amenable to intervention and may be modified by interventions aimed at training-program design, reducing impact-related forces (eg, instructing an athlete to run ""softer"" or with a higher stride rate), and increasing the strength and/or endurance of local musculature (eg, strengthening the calf for tibial BSIs and the foot intrinsics for BSIs of the metatarsals). Similarly, malalignments and abnormal movement patterns should be explored and addressed. The current commentary discusses management and prevention of BSIs in runners. In doing so, information is provided on the pathophysiology, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical diagnosis, and classification of BSIs.","Warden, SJ; Davis, IS; Fredericson, M",0,10.2519/jospt.2014.5334,1399
1827,The European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidance on suicide treatment and prevention,"Suicide is a major public health problem in the WHO European Region accounting for over 150,000 deaths per year.Suicidal crisis: Acute intervention should start immediately in order to keep the patient alive.Diagnosis: An underlying psychiatric disorder is present in up to 90% of people who completed suicide. Comorbidity with depression, anxiety, substance abuse and personality disorders is high. In order to achieve successful prevention of suicidality, adequate diagnostic procedures and appropriate treatment for the underlying disorder are essential.Treatment: Existing evidence supports the efficacy of pharmacological treatment and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in preventing suicidal behaviour. Some other psychological treatments are promising, but the supporting evidence is currently insufficient. Studies show that antidepressant treatment decreases the risk for suicidality among depressed patients. However, the risk of suicidal behaviour in depressed patients treated with antidepressants exists during the first 10-14 days of treatment, which requires careful monitoring. Short-term supplementary medication with anxiolytics and hypnotics in the case of anxiety and insomnia is recommended. Treatment with antidepressants of children and adolescents should only be given under supervision of a specialist. Long-term treatment with lithium has been shown to be effective in preventing both suicide and attempted suicide in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Treatment with clozapine is effective in reducing suicidal behaviour in patients with schizophrenia. Other atypical antipsychotics are promising but more evidence is required.Treatment team: Multidisciplinary treatment teams including psychiatrist and other professionals such as psychologist, social worker, and occupational therapist are always preferable, as integration of pharmacological, psychological and social rehabilitation is recommended especially for patients with chronic suicidality.Family: The suicidal person independently of age should always be motivated to involve family in the treatment.Social support: Psychosocial treatment and support is recommended, as the majority of suicidal patients have problems with relationships, work, school and lack functioning social networks.Safety: A secure home, public and hospital environment, without access to suicidal means is a necessary strategy in suicide prevention. Each treatment option, prescription of medication and discharge of the patient from hospital should be carefully evaluated against the involved risks.Training of personnel: Training of general practitioners (GPs) is effective in the prevention of suicide. It improves treatment of depression and anxiety, quality of the provided care and attitudes towards suicide. Continuous training including discussions about ethical and legal issues is necessary for psychiatrists and other mental health professionals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

1828,Pathway from PTSD to respiratory health: Longitudinal evidence from a psychosocial intervention,"Objective: Respiratory illness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common debilitating conditions that frequently co-occur. Observational studies indicate that PTSD, independently of smoking, is a major risk and maintenance factor for lower respiratory symptoms (LRS). The current study experimentally tested this etiologic pathway by investigating whether LRS can be reduced by treating PTSD symptoms. Method: Ninety daily smokers exposed to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster (mean age 50 years, 28% female; 68% White) completed 8-session group-based weekly comprehensive trauma management and smoking cessation treatment that focused on skills to alleviate PTSD symptoms. LRS, PTSD symptoms, and smoking were assessed weekly. Data was analyzed using multilevel models of within-person associations between LRS, PTSD symptoms, smoking, and treatment dose across 8 weekly sessions with concurrent and lagged outcomes. Results: LRS improved significantly with treatment (reduction of .50 standard deviations). Reduction in PTSD symptoms uniquely predicted improvement in LRS at consecutive sessions 1 week apart and fully accounted for the treatment effect on LRS. The effect of PTSD symptoms was stronger than that of smoking, and the only effect to remain significant when both entered the model. Notably, reduction in LRS did not predict future improvement in PTSD symptoms. Conclusions: The results are in line with the etiologic pathway suggesting that PTSD symptoms are a risk and maintenance factor for chronic LRS and that treatment of PTSD can help to alleviate LRS in trauma-exposed populations. PTSD is emerging as a novel and important treatment target for chronic respiratory problems.

1829,Postdisaster Psychological Intervention Since 9/11,"A wealth of research and experience after 9/11 has led to the development of evidence-based and evidence-informed guidelines and strategies to support the design and implementation of public mental health programs after terrorism and disaster. This article reviews advances that have been made in a variety of areas, including development of improved metrics and methodologies for conducting needs assessment, screening, surveillance, and program evaluation; clarification of risk and resilience factors as these relate to varying outcome trajectories for survivors and inform interventions; development and implementation of evidence-based and evidence-informed early, midterm, and late interventions for children, adults, and families; adaptation of interventions for cultural, ethnic, and minority groups; improvement in strategies to expand access to postdisaster mental health services; and enhancement of training methods and platforms for workforce development among psychologists, paraprofessionals, and other disaster responders. Continuing improvement of psychologists' national capacity to respond to catastrophic events will require more systematic research to strengthen the evidence base for postdisaster screening and interventions and effective methods and platforms for training. Policy decisions are clearly needed that enhance federal funding to increase availability and access to services, especially for longer term care. Traumatic bereavement represents a critical area for future research, as much needs to be done to clarify issues related to reactions and adaptation to a traumatic death.

1832,A comparison of a behavioral weight loss program to a stress management program: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"Objectives: This study compared a behavioral weight loss program (BWL) with a stress management-based program, Emotional Brain Training (EBT), on weight loss, blood pressure, depression, perceived stress, diet, and physical activity. Methods: Subjects with a body mass index (BMI) of >28 and <45 kg/m2 were recruited in Lexington, Kentucky in January 2014 and randomized to BWL or EBT for a 20-week intervention. Of those recruited, 49 participants were randomized to EBT or BWL. Randomization and allocation to group were performed using SPSS software. Weight, blood pressure, depression, perceived stress, dietary intake, and physical activity were measured at baseline, 10 week, and 20 week. Linear models for change over time were fit to calculate 95% confidence intervals of intervention effects. Results: BWL produced greater changes in BMI than EBT at both 10 (P = 0.02) and 20 wk (P = 0.03). At 10 wk, both EBT and BWL improved BMI, systolic blood pressure, depression and perceived stress (P < 0.05). BWL also improved diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.005). At 20 wk, EBT maintained improvements in BMI, systolic blood pressure, depression, and perceived stress while BWL maintained improvements only in BMI and depression (P < 0.05). Conclusions: BWL produced greater weight loss than EBT; however, EBT produced sustained improvements in stress, depression, and systolic blood pressure. A combination of the two approaches should be explored. Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Webber K.H., Casey E.M., Mayes L., Katsumata Y., Mellin L.",0,10.1016/j.nut.2016.01.008,1403

1836,The role of regular physical activity in preeclampsia prevention,"Preeclampsia affects 2-7% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Despite extensive study, the etiology of preeclampsia is poorly understood. Abnormal placental development, predisposing maternal constitutional factors, oxidative stress, immune maladaptation, and genetic susceptibility have all been hypothesized to contribute to the development of preeclampsia. Physical conditioning and preeclampsia have opposite effects on critical physiological functions. This suggests that regular prenatal exercise may prevent or oppose the progression of the disease. Epidemiologic studies show that occupational and leisure-time physical activity is associated with a reduced incidence of preeclampsia. We hypothesize that this protective effect results from one of more of the following mechanisms:1) stimulation of placental growth and vascularity,2) reduction of oxidative stress, and3) exercise-induced reversal of maternal endothelial dysfunction. Future research should include prospective epidemiological case-control studies that accurately measure occupational and leisure-time physical activity. Controlled randomized clinical trials examining the effects of prenatal exercise on biochemical markers for endothelial dysfunction, placental dysfunction, and oxidative stress are also needed. If future research supports the idea that exercise effectively protects against preeclampsia, this would provide a low-cost intervention that could dramatically improve prenatal care for women at risk of this disease.","Weissgerber, TL; Wolfe, LA; Davies, GAL",0,10.1249/01.MSS.0000147627.35139.DC,1405

Methods: A randomized and controlled design was used to organize 96 participants into an education + access group; an access-only group, and control group. Outcome measures were made at start and end of a 12-week intervention period. Results: Education + access improved wellness knowledge, which, in turn, enhanced life satisfaction, employee morale, and energy, and nearly improved stress level. Those who received facility access without educational programming did not reap health benefits. Employees voluntarily used the fitness facility and healthy meal cards only 1.3 and 1.5 times per week, respectively. Conclusions: Participants made limited and likely inadequate use of wellness opportunities. As a result, physical health benefits (eg, blood pressure, fitness parameters) were not seen in the present study. However, multipoint wellness education resulted in psychosocial health benefits in 12 weeks.","Sforzo, Gary A.; Kaye, Miranda P.; Calleri, David; Ngai, Nancy",1,10.1097/JOM.0b013e3182479f5c,1406
1840,"When does incivility lead to counterproductive work behavior? Roles of job involvement, task interdependence, and gender","This research investigated the conditions under which exposure to incivility at work was associated with engaging in counterproductive work behavior (CWB). Drawing from stressor-strain and coping frameworks, we predicted that experienced incivility would be associated with engaging in production deviance and withdrawal behavior, and that these relationships would be strongest for employees who had high levels of job involvement and worked under task interdependent conditions. Gender differences in these effects were also investigated. A sample of 250 United States full-time employees from various occupations completed 2 waves (timed 6 weeks apart) of an online survey. Results indicate that employees with high job involvement were more likely to engage in production deviance and withdrawal behavior following exposure to incivility than were employees with low job involvement. The moderating effect of task interdependence varied by gender, such that the relationship between incivility and CWB was strengthened under high task interdependence for female employees, but weakened under high task interdependence for male employees. These findings highlight that certain work conditions can increase employees' susceptibility to the impacts of incivility, leading to harmful outcomes for organizations.

1841,Evaluation of a Technology-Based Adaptive Learning and Prevention Program for Stress Response-A Randomized Controlled Trial,"To prevent deployment-related disorders, Chaos Driven Situations Management Retrieval System (CHARLY), a computer-aided training platform with a biofeedback interface has been developed. It simulates critical situations photorealistic for certain target and occupational groups. CHARLY was evaluated as a 1.5 days predeployment training method comparing it with the routine training. The evaluation was carried out for a matched random sample of N = 67 soldiers deployed in Afghanistan (International Security Assistance Force). Data collection took place before and after the prevention program and 4 to 6 weeks after deployment, which included mental state, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, knowledge of and attitude toward PTSD, and deployment-specific stressors. CHARLY has been significantly superior to the control group in terms of psychoeducation and attitude change. As to the mental state, both groups showed a significant increase in stress after deployment with significant lower increase in CHARLY. For PTSD-specific symptoms, CHARLY achieved a significant superiority. The fact that PTSD-specific scales showed significant differences at the end of deployment substantiates the validity of a specifically preventive effect of CHARLY. The study results tentatively indicate that highly standardized, computer-based primary prevention of mental disorders in soldiers on deployment might be superior to other more personal and less standardized forms of prevention.","Wesemann, Ulrich; Kowalski, Jens T.; Jacobsen, Thomas; Susan, Beudt; Jacobs, Herbert; Fehr, Julia; Buechler, Jana; Zimmermann, Peter L.",0,10.7205/MILMED-D-15-00100,1408
1842,Emotion dysregulation in comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use disorders: A narrative review,"Co-occurrence of substance use disorders (SUDs) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is extremely common and is associated with elevated dropout and relapse rates. Given that PTSD/SUD co-occurrence rates among veterans have been found to be as high as 55-75%, it is important to identify mechanisms that may affect the interplay of both disorders. Emotion dysregulation (ED) presents a candidate mechanism that may underlie poor treatment response in co-occurring PTSD/SUD. This article proposes a transdiagnostic emotion regulation framework that considers ED conceptualized as a combination of low ability to tolerate emotional distress (low distress tolerance) and difficulties in the goal-directed use of emotion regulation strategies as a key risk factor in co-occurring PTSD/SUD. The authors review empirical findings from self-report and laboratory-based studies of ED in PTSD. They describe psychological explanations of the emotion-substance relationship and review studies documenting ED in SUDs and in co-occurring PTSD/SUD. The literature on ED in PTSD/SUD suggests that (a) patients with PTSD may resort to substances to cope with trauma-related symptoms due to ED, and (b) ED may maintain SUD symptoms and interfere with psychological treatment. Longitudinal studies on bidirectional relationships between ED and substance use in PTSD are needed, particularly research examining the course of ED in PTSD patients who use substances versus those who do not.

1849,Cognitive and psychological flexibility after a traumatic brain injury and the implications for treatment in acceptance-based therapies: A conceptual review,"This paper provides a selective review of cognitive and psychological flexibility in the context of treatment for psychological distress after traumatic brain injury, with a focus on acceptance-based therapies. Cognitive flexibility is a component of executive function that is referred to mostly in the context of neuropsychological research and practice. Psychological flexibility, from a clinical psychology perspective, is linked to health and well-being and is an identified treatment outcome for therapies such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). There are a number of overlaps between the constructs. They both manifest in the ability to change behaviour (either a thought or an action) in response to environmental change, with similarities in neural substrate and mental processes. Impairments in both show a strong association with psychopathology. People with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) often suffer impairments in their cognitive flexibility as a result of damage to areas controlling executive processes but have a positive response to therapies that promote psychological flexibility. Overall, psychological flexibility appears a more overarching construct and cognitive flexibility may be a subcomponent of it but not necessarily a pre-requisite. Further research into therapies which claim to improve psychological flexibility, such as ACT, needs to be undertaken in TBI populations in order to clarify its utility in this group.

Given the prevalence of stress and burnout among school personnel, concrete interventions designed to address the unique demands and enhance coping resources of school personnel are necessary. One promising mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) for school personnel, Cultivating Awareness and Resilience in Education (CARE), is introduced and explored. Using semi-structured interviews, the current study investigated how participants applied mindfulness strategies learned through the mindfulness-based intervention CARE. Participants reported shifting their emotional reactivity and approach to students by applying mindfulness through (1) present-centered awareness of emotions, (2) emotional reappraisal of situations, and (3) use of metaphors introduced through the CARE program. Results suggest that the CARE program is a promising approach to support school personnel experiencing stress and burnout.

It aims to ensure that trauma-exposed personnel are properly supported and encouraged to seek timely help should they develop mental health problems that fail to resolve spontaneously.Aims To summarize current knowledge about TRiM and make recommendations for further research.Methods A search of PsychINFO, CINAHL and PubMed identified 13 published papers.Results TRiM outcomes were represented in different ways within the relevant studies suggesting that TRiM may have effects additional to those that it seeks to achieve. For example, a randomized controlled trial demonstrated that TRiM had a specific positive occupational effect and did no harm; a qualitative study suggested that TRiM enhanced liaison between mental health workers and line managers and a service evaluation suggested that it reduced sickness absence. In general, the process appears to enhance trauma-exposed personnel's reliance on peer support and TRiM was reportedly acceptable and sustainable.Conclusions Evidence suggests that TRiM's utility has moved beyond the military to other organizations where personnel risk occupational traumatic exposure. Further research would help to understand how TRiM is perceived by line managers and how it functions within the trauma-prone populations.","Whybrow, D.; Jones, N.; Greenberg, N.",0,10.1093/occmed/kqv024,1416
1855,An Expanded Delivery Model for Outpatient Burn Rehabilitation,"Despite the numerous multidisciplinary services burn centers provide, a number of challenges to obtaining optimal outcomes exist. The goal of this study was to overcome the barriers to effective burn rehabilitation by utilizing an expanded care coordinator (ECC) to supplement the existing outpatient services. In this between-group, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial, the control group (n = 41) received standard outpatient care and the experimental group (n = 40) received additional services provided by the ECC, including telephone calls at set intervals (24 hours postdischarge, 2, 4, 8, 12 weeks postdischarge and 5, 7, 9 months postdischarge). The ECC was trained in motivational interviewing, crisis intervention, and solution-focused counseling. He assisted patients before and after each clinic visit, coordinated outpatient services in their geographic area (physical and occupational therapy, counseling, primary care provider referrals, etc.), and helped develop problem-solving approaches to accomplish individualized goals. Outcome measures included patient identified goals utilizing the goal attainment scale, the urn-specific health scale-brief, the Short Form 12, a patient satisfaction survey, and a return to work survey. The average subject age was 43 years (SD = 16.9) with a mean TBSA of 19% (SD = 18.8). The average length of hospitalization was 36 days (SD = 42.9). The patient and injury characteristics were similar between the study groups. For the experimental group, 33% completed seven calls, with 23% completing all the eight calls. All were assessed using general linear models and were adjusted for sex, age, length of hospitalization, urban vs rural area of residence, % TBSA burn, and ethnicity. There was no difference between the control and experimental groups for any of the outcome measures at either 6 or 12 months postburn. No differences in outcomes between the groups were found. All participants appreciated the individualized goal setting process that was used as an outcome measure and this may have accounted for the similar outcomes in both the groups. (The measure may have been more of an intervention, thus contributing to the strength of the control group.) Although most patients with burn injuries may not need an intervention that is this intensive, a subset of patients at higher risk or with more severe injuries may benefit from more intensive and personalized services. Future research should examine the benefits of individual goal setting processes for all the patients and also attempt to identify those patients most at risk for poorer outcomes and therefore, likely to benefit of more intensive personalized services.","Wiechman, Shelley A.; Carrougher, Gretchen J.; Esselman, Peter C.; Klein, Matthew B.; Martinez, Erin M.; Engrav, Loren H.; Gibran, Nicole S.",0,10.1097/BCR.0000000000000153,1417
1856,Biomechanical Evaluation of a Bed Feature to Assist in Turning and Laterally Repositioning Patients,"Objective: This study investigated the effects of hospital bed features on the biomechanical stresses experienced by nurses when turning and laterally repositioning patients. Turn Assist, a common feature in ICU beds that helps to rotate patients, and side rail orientation were evaluated. Background: Manual patient handling is a risk factor for musculoskeletal injury, and turning patients is one of the most common patient handling activities. No known studies have evaluated bed attributes such as the Turn Assist feature and side rail orientation that may affect the stresses experienced by the nurse. Method: Nine female nurses laterally repositioned and turned a 63-kg and 123-kg subject on an ICU bed while motion capture, ground reaction forces, and hand force data were recorded. Loading of the spine and shoulder was modeled using 3D Static Strength Prediction Program (3DSSPP). Results: Spine compression and shear forces did not exceed recommended limits when turning or laterally repositioning. However, the mean pull forces required to manually laterally reposition even the 63-kg subject was 340 Newtons, more than 50% greater than limits established in psychophysical testing. Turn Assist considerably reduced spine loading and pull forces for both turning and laterally repositioning. Lowering side rails reduced spinal compression by 11% when turning patients. Conclusion: Laterally repositioning patients as part of turning may pose an injury risk to caregivers. Turn Assist reduces physical loading on nurses when turning and repositioning patients. Application: Caregivers should consider using Turn Assist and other aids such as mechanical lifts or sliding sheets especially when turning patients requires lateral repositioning.

1857,An evaluation of social work services in a cancer accommodation facility for rural South Australians,"The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the social work service at an accommodation facility for people receiving cancer treatment away from home with a focus on distress, impact of support, and type of assistance received from the social work service.Guests who stayed at the Cancer Council Lodge during June 2015 were mailed a questionnaire collecting information about level of distress upon arrival and departure, impact of support in several areas, and what the service assisted them with specifically.The sample comprised 149 guests. Social work contact (n = 19) was associated with greater reduction in distress between arrival and departure compared with no contact (n = 56). Contact with a social worker was associated with greater odds of agreeing or strongly agreeing that guests felt supported in 6 out of 10 areas assessed. These areas were managing the challenges related to cancer, approaching support services, asking questions of healthcare teams, accessing support services, coping with strong emotions, and understanding reactions of family and friends.

1858,A systematic review of the effectiveness of alcohol brief interventions for the UK military personnel moving back to civilian life,"Background Higher levels of alcohol consumption have been observed in the UK armed forces compared with the general population. For some, this may increase the risk of using alcohol as a coping strategy when adjusting to multiple life events occurring when moving back into civilian life.Method A systematic review was conducted to determine the effectiveness of alcohol brief interventions for military personnel during transition. Electronic databases including Medline, Central, Healthcare Management Information Consortium (HMIC) and Embase, and grey literature, were searched. Two reviewers independently assessed potential studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed quality of selected articles using an established instrument.Results Ten studies met criteria for inclusion. Studies were synthesised narratively. Interventions were heterogeneous, and bias within studies may have acted to increase or decrease their reported effectiveness. The findings suggest some evidence for effectiveness of self-administered web-based interventions, involving personalised feedback over a number of sessions, and system-level electronic clinical reminders. All studies were from the USA. Delivery of interventions by a clinician during motivational interviews was most effective for those with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms.Conclusions A UK trial of web-based interventions with personalised feedback is recommended.","Wigham, Sarah; Bauer, A.; Robalino, S.; Ferguson, J.; Burke, A.; Newbury-Birch, D.",0,10.1136/jramc-2016-000712,1420
1860,Musical Excellence: Strategies and Techniques to Enhance Performance,"This book offers new perspectives and practical guidance for enhancing performance and managing the stress that typically accompanies performance situations. Specific recommendations are provided alongside comprehensive reviews of existing theory and research, enabling the practitioner to place the strategies and techniques within the broader context of human performance, and encouraging novel ways of conceptualizing music making and teaching. Part I sets out ground rules for achieving musical excellence. What roles do innate talent, environmental influences, and sheer hard work play in attaining eminence? How can musicians best manage the physical demands of a profession that is intrinsically arduous, throughout a career that can literally span a lifetime? How can performers, teachers, and researchers effectively assess and reflect on performance enhancement for themselves, their colleagues, and their students? Part II presents approaches for increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of practice. These are examined generally for the individual and ensembles and specifically for the tasks of memorizing, sight-reading, and improvising music. Musicians spend vast amounts of time and energy acquiring and refining their skills, but are there particular rehearsal strategies that they can employ to produce better performance results or to achieve the same results more quickly? What implication does existing knowledge of human information processing and physical functioning have for musical learning and practice? Part III introduces scientifically validated methods for enhancing musical achievement, ordered from the more physical to the psychological to the pharmacological; however, they all address issues of both mental and physical significance for the musician. Collectively, they stand as clear evidence that applied, cross-disciplinary research can facilitate musicians' strives for performance excellence. Â© Oxford University Press 2004.

1862,"Work, weight, and wellness: The 3W program: A worksite obesity prevention and intervention trial","Objective: In this paper, we describe the aims, intervention, and design of the Work, Weight, and Wellness program, a group-randomized worksite obesity prevention and intervention trial being conducted at 31 hotels with 11,559 employees on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. We report baseline prevalence of overweight and obesity, and the distribution of BMI (kilograms per meter squared) across sex, race, and job categories. We also describe factors that have influenced intervention adoption and employee participation. Research Methods and Procedures: The study's primary outcome is change in BMI among hotel employees over a 2-year intervention period. The intervention includes environmental and group components that target diet, physical activity, and weight management. Results: Men, Pacific Islanders, and individuals employed in managerial or facility maintenance roles had higher prevalence of obesity and higher mean BMI than women and individuals from other races or in other occupational categories. Discussion: These results may be helpful in guiding choices about the adoption or design of future worksite and community interventions addressing at-risk ethnically diverse populations and are especially relevant to the hotel industry and similar industries.

1863,"Fear of negative evaluation, avoidance and mental distress among hearing-impaired employees","Objective: This study examined the relationship between hearing impairment and mental distress. We hypothesized that fear of negative evaluation by others and avoidant communication strategies are associated with increased symptoms of depression. Method: Hearing-impaired adults (N = 105) who signed up for a stress management course completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983), the Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (FNE; Watson & Friend, 1969), and the Conversation Tactics Checklist (CONV; Hallam et al., 2007). The participants' ratings of subjective hearing disability were assessed on a 5-point Likert scale and pure-tone audiometry obtained. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to assess associations between fear of negative evaluation, avoidance, and symptoms of depression. Results: Objective hearing impairment was moderate or less for 81% (n = 87) of participants, and the correlation between subjective hearing disability and objective hearing impairment was not significant. Multiple regression analysis showed that fear of negative evaluation and avoidant communication strategies contributed significantly to the variance in depression symptoms, and the total explained variance was 41.7%, F(5, 93) = 13.32, p = .000. Subjective and objective hearing disability did not make significant contributions. Conclusion: Symptoms of depression appear to be closely related to fear of negative evaluation by others and use of avoidant communication strategies. Future clinical studies should address whether targeting these problems in rehabilitation interventions decreases depressive symptoms among hearing-impaired individuals.

1864,Challenge and threat imagery manipulates heart rate and anxiety responses to stress,"This study investigated the influence of different types of mental imagery on heart rate and anxiety responses to a standard psychological stress task. Using a within-design, 25 females (Mage = 23.24; SD = 4.19) imaged three different scripts (challenge, threat, and neutral) to manipulate appraisal of a speech preparation task. Following each script, participants completed the task. Heart rate was recorded during a resting baseline prior to each imagery script and during each speech preparation task. Cognitive and somatic anxiety and self-confidence were assessed prior to the speech preparation trials, and immediately prior to each speech preparation following imagery. Following threat imagery, participants reported the speech preparation task to be significantly more stressful and threatening, and experienced lower levels of confidence and more negative interpretations of their anxiety symptoms compared with the challenge and neutral imagery conditions. Additionally, there was a significantly greater increase in heart rate following threat imagery compared with challenge and neutral imagery. Findings demonstrate that imagery can alter stress appraisal and the accompanying cardiovascular and psychological responses to standardized stress tasks. Imagery interventions, acknowledging the stressful nature of events, but emphasising feelings of efficacy and control are likely to lead to more adaptive coping.

1865,Design element alternatives for stress-management intervention websites,"Typical public and military-sponsored websites on stress and depression tend to be prescriptive. Some require users to complete lengthy questionnaires. Others reproduce Printed flyers, papers, or educational materials not adapted for online use. Some websites require users to follow a prescribed path through the material. Stress Gym was developed as a first-level, evidence-based, website intervention to help U.S. military members learn how to manage mild to moderate stress and depressive symptoms using a self-help intervention with progress tracking and 24/7availablility. It was designed using web-based, health-management intervention design elements that have been proven effective and users reported they prefer. These included interactivity, self-pacing, and pleasing aesthetics. Users learned how to manage stress by accessing modules they choose, and by practicing proven stress management strategies interactively immediately after login. Test results of Stress Gym with Navy members demonstrated that it was effective, with significant decreases in reported perceived stress levels from baseline to follow-up assessment. Stress Gym used design elements that may serve as a model for future websites to emulate and improve upon, and as a template against which to compare and contrast the design and functionality of future online, health-intervention websites.

1866,The Impact of Sleep on Soldier Performance,"The military population is particularly vulnerable to a multitude of sleep-related disorders owing to the type of work performed by active duty servicemembers (ADSMs). Inadequate sleep, due to insufficient quantity or quality, is increasingly recognized as a public health concern. Traditionally, ADSMs have been encouraged that they can adapt to insufficient sleep just as the body adapts to physical training, but there is a substantial body of scientific literature which argues that this is not possible. Additionally, the military work environment creates unique challenges with respect to treatment options for common sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, and parasomnias. This review highlights sleep disorders which are prevalent in the modern military force and discusses the impact of poor sleep on overall performance. Medical treatments and recommendations for unit leaders are also discussed.","Williams, Scott G.; Collen, Jacob; Wickwire, Emerson; Lettieri, Christopher J.; Mysliwiec, Vincent",0,10.1007/s11920-014-0459-7,1427
1868,"Effects of web-based psychoeducation on self-efficacy, problem solving behavior, stress responses and job satisfaction among workers: A controlled clinical trial","This study examined effects of web-based psychoeducation on self-efficacy, problem solving behavior, stress responses and job satisfaction. The program was based on social cognitive theory and was primarily aimed at increasing knowledge of stress, self-efficacy, and the use of problem solving behavior. A total of 225 employees were invited to participate in the study. Participants were assigned to an intervention (n=112) or waiting list control group (n=113). Those in the intervention group were asked to access the website and to complete learning within 1 month. To investigate the intervention effect, the change score in the outcome variable was calculated by subtracting the score at pre-intervention from that at post-intervention (1 week after completion of the learning period). Then, the difference in the scores between groups was examined using analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) with the pre-intervention score as the covariate. We detected a marginally significant difference between groups in changes in job satisfaction from pre- to post-intervention (p=0.081). Participants in the intervention group showed an increase in job satisfaction score, while those in the waiting list control group showed a decrease in it. No significant differences were detected between groups in the other indicators (p >.10). We detected significant or marginally significant intervention effects on self-efficacy, problem solving behavior, stress responses, and job satisfaction among males and younger individuals, and those who had initially higher job strain and higher interest in managing stress. Further research is required with longer time periods (controlled follow-up) and a broader sample to fully determine the intervention effect.","Shimazu, A; Kawakami, N; Irimajiri, H; Sakamoto, M; Amano, S",1,10.1539/joh.47.405,1428
1869,Pilot study of a self-administered stress management and exercise intervention during chemotherapy for cancer,"Goals of work: This pilot project explored the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of a self-administered exercise and stress management intervention for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients and methods: Thirty-nine of 56 eligible patients (acceptance =69%) with a variety of solid tumors volunteered for the study. Participants were advised to exercise 20-40 min at 50-75% estimated heart rate reserve 3-5 times per week. In addition, patients were provided with instruction and written materials regarding stress management techniques. Follow-up data were collected during regularly scheduled outpatient visits at the start of the second, third, and fourth chemotherapy cycles using diary entries and the same questionnaires previously administered at baseline. Main results: Twenty-four of 39 patients (62%) completed all study requirements. These participants completed 438 of the 678 exercise sessions assigned (adherence =62%). Of the stress management techniques, positive thinking most practiced most frequently (48%), followed by deep breathing (38%) and active relaxation (37%). Paired t tests, comparing baseline values with final recorded values, indicated a significant improvement over time in bodily pain (p<0.03) and mental health (p<0.04) subscale scores. Participants' evaluations of the combined intervention were favorable: 90% felt it was helpful to them and 100% would recommend it to another patient. Conclusions: A self-administered intervention combining aerobic exercise and stress management was acceptable and safe for cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Preliminary data demonstrating intervention efficacy should be confirmed in subsequent randomized clinical trials.

1871,Stress management with law enforcement personnel: A controlled outcome study of EMDR versus a traditional stress management program,"Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) has been shown to be effective for treating posttraumatic stress disorder, but its efficacy as a stress management tool for normal individuals in highly stressful occupations has not been demonstrated. Sixty-two police officers were randomly assigned to either EMDR or a standard stress management program (SMP), each consisting of 6 hours of individualized contact. At completion, officers in the EMDR condition provided lower ratings on measures of PTSD symptoms, subjective distress, job stress, and anger; and higher marital satisfaction ratings than those in SMP. The effects of EMDR were maintained at the 6-month follow-up, indicating enduring gains from a relatively brief treatment regimen for this subclinical sample of officers who were experiencing some level of stress from their job.","Wilson, SA; Tinker, RH; Becker, LA; Logan, CR",0,10.1023/A:1011366408693,1430
1874,Effects of mental health interventions for students in higher education are sustainable over time: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,"Background: Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and distress are more common in undergraduates compared to age-matched peers. Mental ill health among students is associated with impaired academic achievement, worse occupational preparedness, and lower future occupational performance. Research on mental health promoting and mental ill health preventing interventions has shown promising short-term effects, though the sustainability of intervention benefits deserve closer attention. We aimed to identify, appraise and summarize existing data from randomized control trials (RCTs) reporting on whether the effects of mental health promoting and mental ill health preventing interventions were sustained at least three months post-intervention, and to analyze how the effects vary for different outcomes in relation to follow-up length. Further, we aimed to assess whether the effect sustainability varied by intervention type, study-level determinants and of participant characteristics.Material and Methods: A systematic search in MEDLINE, PsycInfo, ERIC, and Scopus was performed for RCTs published in 1995-2015 reporting an assessment of mental ill health and positive mental health outcomes for, at least, three months of post-intervention follow-up. Random-effect modeling was utilized for quantitative synthesis of the existing evidence with standardized mean difference (Hedges g) used to estimate an aggregated effect size. Sustainability of the effects of interventions was analyzed separately for 3-6 months, 7-12 months, and 13-18 months of post-intervention follow-up.Results: About 26 studies were eligible after reviewing 6,571 citations. The pooled effects were mainly small, but significant for several categories of outcomes. Thus, for the combined mental ill health outcomes, symptom-reduction sustained up to 7-12 months post-intervention (standardized mean difference (Hedges g) effect size (ES) = -0.28 (95% CI [-0.49, -0.08])). Further, sustainability of symptom-reductions were evident for depression with intervention effect lasting up to 1318 months (ES = -0.30 (95% CI [-0.51, -0.08])), for anxiety up to 7-12 months (ES = -0.27 (95% CI [-0.54, -0.01])), and for stress up to 3-6 months (ES = -0.30 (95% CI [-0.58, -0.03])). The effects of interventions to enhance positive mental health were sustained up to 3-6 months for the combined positive mental health outcomes (ES = 0.32 (95% CI [0.05, 0.59])). For enhanced active coping, sustainability up to 3-6 months was observed with a medium and significant effect (ES = 0.75 (95% CI [0.19, 1.30])).Discussion: The evidence suggests long-term effect sustainability for mental ill health preventive interventions, especially for interventions to reduce the symptoms of depression and symptoms of anxiety. Interventions to promote positive mental health offer promising, but shorter-lasting effects. Future research should focus on mental health organizational interventions to examine their potential for students in tertiary education.","Winzer, Regina; Lindberg, Lene; Guldbrandsson, Karin; Sidorchuk, Anna",0,10.7717/peerj.4598,1431
1875,Managers' Experiences of Meditation Awareness Training,"Due to its potential to improve work-related stress and job performance, there is growing interest into the applications of mindfulness in the workplace setting. To date, mindfulness research within occupational psychology has mostly involved First Generation Mindfulness-Based Interventions (FG-MBIs). However, a growing number of researchers, clinicians, and Buddhist teachers/scholars have suggested that FG-MBIs may only partially embody the full potency of mindfulness when compared with its utilisation in traditional Buddhist practice settings. Consequently, recent years have witnessed the early stage evaluation of a number of Second Generation Mindfulness-Based Interventions (SG-MBIs). Although still secular, SG-MBIs are overtly spiritual in aspect and teach mindfulness within a practice infrastructure that integrates what would traditionally be deemed as prerequisites for effective spiritual and meditative development. The purpose of this study was to conduct the first qualitative investigation to analyse the experiences of employed participants receiving training in a SG-MBI. Ten participants were randomly selected from the intervention arm of a randomised controlled trial assessing the effects of meditation awareness training (MAT) on work-related wellbeing and job performance. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse participant experiences of MAT, and six themes emerged from the data-set: (1) changing attitudes towards work, (2) improved job performance, (3) letting go of self, (4) phenomena feed-back effect, (5) wellbeing at work and (6) taking responsibility for one's spiritual growth. Findings have important implications for the development of authentic mindfulness training programs and suggest that, compared with FG-MBIs, the SG-MBI approach may be tapping into different metacognitive resources.","Shonin, Edo; Van Gordon, William",1,10.1007/s12671-014-0334-y,1432

1878,Preventing children's posttraumatic stress after disaster with teacher-based intervention: A controlled study,"Objective: The psychological outcomes that the exposure to mass trauma has on children have been amply documented in the past decades. The objective of this study is to describe the effects of a universal, teacher-based preventive intervention implemented with Israeli students before the rocket attacks that occurred during Operation Cast Lead, compared with a nonintervention but exposed control group. Method: The study sample consisted of 1,488 students studying in fourth and fifth grades in a city in southern Israel who were exposed to continuous rocket attacks during Operation Cast Lead. The intervention group included about half (53.5%) of the children who studied in six schools where the teacher-led intervention was implemented 3 months before the traumatic exposure. The control group (46.5% of the sample) included six schools matched by exposure in which the preventive intervention was not implemented. Children filled out the UCLA-PTSD Reaction Index and the Stress/Mood Scale 3 months after the end of the rocket attacks. Results: The intervention group displayed significantly lower symptoms of posttrauma and stress/mood than the control group (p < .001). Control children had 57% more detected cases of postraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than participant children. This difference was significantly more pronounced among boys (10.2% versus 4.4%) and less among girls (12.5% versus10.1%). Conclusions: The teacher-based, resilience-focused intervention is a universal, cost-effective approach to enhance the preparedness of communities of children to mass trauma and to prevent the development of PTSD after exposure.

1879,Treating Subthreshold Depression in Primary Care: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Behavioral Activation With Mindfulness,"PURPOSE We undertook a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of group-based behavioral activation with mindfulness (BAM) for treating subthreshold depression in primary care in Hong Kong.METHODS We recruited adult patients aged 18 years or older with subthreshold depression from public primary care clinics and randomly assigned them to a BAM intervention group or a usual care group. The BAM group was provided with eight 2-hour weekly BAM sessions by trained allied health care workers. Patients in the usual care group received usual medical care with no additional psychological interventions. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included incidence of major depressive disorder at 12 months. We assessed quality of life, activity and circumstances change, functional impairment, and anxiety at baseline, end of intervention, 5 months, and 12 months.RESULTS We randomly allocated 115 patients to the BAM intervention and 116 patients to usual care. At 12 months, compared with usual care peers, BAM patients had a slightly more favorable change in levels of depressive symptoms on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (between-group mean difference in score = -3.85; 95% CI, -6.36 to -1.34; Cohen d = -0.46, 95% CI, -0.76 to -0.16). Incidence of major depressive disorder was lower with BAM (10.8% vs 26.8%, P = .01), whereas groups did not differ significantly on other secondary outcomes at 12 months.CONCLUSIONS Group BAM appears to be efficacious for decreasing depressive symptoms and reducing the incidence of major depression among patients with subthreshold depression in primary care, although generalizability of our findings may be limited.","Wong, Samuel Y.

1882,Identifying risks for mental health problems in HIV positive adolescents accessing HIV treatment in Johannesburg,"Background: Mental health problems of adolescents are underserved in low and middle-income countries where they account for a significant proportion of disease burden. Perinatally infected HIV-positive adolescents have a high prevalence of mental health disorders; however, little is known about those retained in care in South Africa. Methods: HIV-positive adolescents aged 13â€“19 years (n = 343) accessing five paediatric antiretroviral clinics in Johannesburg were assessed using standardized measures for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidality. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted on all variables using Statistica v13. Results: Twenty-seven percent were symptomatic for depression, anxiety, or PTSD; 24% reported suicidality. Peer violence was significantly correlated to all mental health problems, as was hunger, being inappropriately touched, being hit, and being female. Those reporting sickness in the past year were more symptomatic. High exposure to violence was evident. Additionally, not feeling safe at home or in the community increased risk for all mental health disorders. Knowing oneâ€™s HIV status was protective as was having dreams for the future. Conclusion: HIV-positive adolescents accessing care demonstrated high levels of mental health problems that are largely unrecognized and could potentially be addressed within health systems. Mental health difficulties are driven by social challenges that require attention. Â© 2017 NISC Pty Ltd.","Woollett N., Cluver L., Bandeira M., Brahmbhatt H.",0,10.2989/17280583.2017.1283320,1438

1885,Prediction of infant temperament from catecholamine and self-report measures of maternal stress during pregnancy,"The current study examined how maternal catecholamine levels and perceived stress, and anxiety during pregnancy were related to indices of infant temperament at 3 months postpartum. Forty-three (n = 43) pregnant women completed stress and anxiety questionnaires at 28-30 weeks gestation and consented to a blood draw that yielded estimates of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system function, epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE), respectively. At 3 months postpartum, these women reported on their newborn's temperament using the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire. Maternal catecholamine levels obtained during pregnancy were not significantly associated with maternal report of perceived stress, life event, or pregnancy-related anxiety. However, maternal NE during pregnancy was associated with higher report of infant soothability and maternal E was marginally associated with lower ratings of infant soothability. Exploratory analyses revealed that infant sex moderated the relationship between maternal catecholamines and infant temperament. Mothers with higher levels of prenatal NE rated infant boys as having lower activity levels than girls, and mothers with higher levels of prenatal E rated infant boys as having higher distress to limitations. These findings support future research on the relationship between maternal catecholamine levels during pregnancy and the development of infant temperament.","Wroble-Biglan M.C., Dietz L.J., Pienkosky T.V.",0,10.1080/02646830903190912,1440
1886,Intervention effects on emotion regulation in preterm infants with very low birth weight: A randomize controlled trial,"Preterm infants are at risk for emotional difficulties and behavioral problems. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of a clinic-based intervention program (CBIP) and a home-based intervention program (HBIP) compared with a usual care program (UCP) on emotion regulation to stress in preterm infants with very low birth weight (VLBW, birth weight <1500. g). A total of 178 VLBW preterm infants had been previously randomly assigned to receive one of three interventions (57 in CBIP, 63 in HBIP and 58 in UCP). The CBIP and HBIP contained identical child-, parent- and dyad-focused interventions that were provided to infants during hospitalization and were respectively delivered at clinics and at home at PMA 36-38 and 40 weeks, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 months of corrected age. All infants were prospectively observed for behavioral reactivity and regulation in response to experimentally evoke stress evoked by a toy-behind-barrier procedure at 12, 18, and 24 months of corrected age. Their cognitive and language abilities, and mothers' responsiveness were also assessed at 12 months as potential covariates. Compared to the UCP-group infants, the HBIP-group infants exhibited shorter durations of visual orientation to a toy (adjusted difference [95% CI]. = -1.60 [-3.07 to -0.13], p= 0.03), and the CBIP-group infants exhibited shorter durations of avoidance (adjusted difference [95% CI]. = -0.84 [-1.57 to -0.10], p= 0.03) from 12 to 24 months of corrected age. The CBIP and HBIP showed no difference in the stress reactivity from the UCP, however. These results suggest that comprehensive interventions incorporating child-, parent- and dyad-focused services enhanced VLBW preterm infants' emotion regulation in response to stress at toddler age.

1887,Stress in community care teams: Will it affect the sustainability of community care?,"The study investigated whether community care is sustainable by examining the levels of stress and burnout that affect community mental health staff. Six teams from around Great Britain were chosen to take part, representing a number of different facets of care: the type of community model, whether it was in an inner city or suburban area and whether the team had been part of a scientific evaluation of care, in which case it may have contained more experienced and more highly trained staff. The results indicated that community care staff experienced high levels of burnout as a result of the work stressors. These levels were higher than those found in any published study of health professionals within hospitals, but are similar to those found in community teams recently. There was no evidence that any particular model of community care produced less burnout, but working in an inner city did seem to produce the highest levels. There did seem to be some benefit from a moderate staff turnover within teams. These results mirror those of other recent studies. Models of community care can only be sustained by reducing their toxicity on the staff who have to make them work. Therefore, levels of stress and burnout should be included in any evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of service models. The alleviation of these high levels through individual and organisational interventions should now be a high priority.","Wykes T., Stevens W., Everitt B.",0,,1442

1890,Effects of an anger management and stress control program on smoking cessation: A randomized controlled trial,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a cognitive behavioral therapy- oriented anger management and stress control program on smokers' quit rates.Methods: Of 2348 smokers, 350 were randomly allocated into study and control groups (n=175 each). An individualized therapy cessation technique was selected for each participant (combination of behavioral counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, and/or pharmacotherapy). The participants in the control group attended a standard quit program, whereas the study group also received an additional 5-session (90 minutes each) cognitive behavioral therapy-oriented program aimed at improving their anger and stress coping skills. At the beginning of the study, both groups were asked to complete the Trait Anger Scale (TAS) of the State and Trait Anger Scale and the Self-Confident (SCS) and Hopeless (HS) subscales of the Stress Coping Styles Inventory; pretest smoking status of both groups and their coping skills were compared with each other as soon as the program ended (post-test results) and after 3 and 6 months (first and second follow-up tests).Results: Although there was no difference between pretest scores on the TAS (P = .234), SCS (P =.130), and HS (P = .148) subscales, post-test results indicate that the study groups' TAS and HS scores decreased and SCS scores increased (P < .001), whereas there was no change in the control group (P > .05). The study group had a better quit level after 6 months compared with the control group (44% vs 27.4%; P < .001). The anger management and stress control program was found to have a significant effect on cessation (odds ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.14 -3.85).Conclusion: The anger and stress coping skills program may increase the success of quitting smoking.","Yalcin B.M., Unal M., Pirdal H., Karahan T.F.",0,10.3122/jabfm.2014.05.140083,1444

Design: Adult patient was admitted with worsening neurological symptoms in the absence of contributory clinical pathology. Interdisciplinary diagnostic and treatment approach included physiatry, neuro- and rehabilitation- psychology, occupational, physical, recreational, and speech therapy. Providers coordinated care and delivered psychologically informed therapies consistent with the standards appropriate to the setting. Results: Diagnosis of FNSD was made 5 weeks after admission. The patient achieved symptom remission at 13 weeks after admission. He remained symptom free at 6 months postdischarge. Implications: Rehabilitation settings are uniquely suited to the treatment of FNSD.

1892,Promoting resilience in stress management for parents (PRISM-P): An intervention for caregivers of youth with serious illness,"Introduction: It is well-known that parental stress and coping impacts the well-being of children with serious illness. The current study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and satisfaction of a novel resilience promoting intervention, the Promoting Resilience in Stress Management Intervention for Parents (PRISM-P) among parents of adolescents and young adults with Type 1 diabetes or cancer. Secondary analyses explored the effect of the PRISM-P on parent-reported resilience and distress. Method: The PRISM-P includes 4 short skills-based modules, delivered in either 2 or 4 separate, individual sessions. English-speaking parents of adolescents with cancer or Type 1 diabetes were eligible. Feasibility was conservatively defined as a completion rate of 80%; satisfaction was qualitatively evaluated based upon parent feedback regarding intervention content, timing, and format. Resilience and distress were assessed pre-and postintervention with the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale and the Kessler-6 Psychological Distress Scale. Results: Twelve of 24 caregivers of youth with diabetes (50%) and 13 of 15 caregivers of youth with cancer (87%) agreed to participate. Nine of 12 (75%) and 9 of 13 (64%) completed all PRISM-P modules, respectively. Among those who completed the intervention, qualitative satisfaction was high. Parent-reported resilience and distress scores improved after the intervention. Effect sizes for both groups indicated a moderate intervention effect. Discussion: Ultimately, the PRISM-P intervention was well accepted and impactful among parents who completed it. However, attrition rates were higher than anticipated, suggesting alternative or less timeintensive formats may be more feasible.

1893,Biological and psychosocial predictors of postpartum depression: Systematic review and call for integration,"Postpartum depression (PPD) adversely affects the health and well being of many new mothers, their infants, and their families. A comprehensive understanding of biopsychosocial precursors to PPD is needed to solidify the current evidence base for best practices in translation. We conducted a systematic review of research published from 2000 through 2013 on biological and psychosocial factors associated with PPD and postpartum depressive symptoms. Two hundred fourteen publications based on 199 investigations of 151,651 women in the first postpartum year met inclusion criteria. The biological and psychosocial literatures are largely distinct, and few studies provide integrative analyses. The strongest PPD risk predictors among biological processes are hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal dysregulation, inflammatory processes, and genetic vulnerabilities. Among psychosocial factors, the strongest predictors are severe life events, some forms of chronic strain, relationship quality, and support from partner and mother. Fully integrated biopsychosocial investigations with large samples are needed to advance our knowledge of PPD etiology. Â© 2015 by Annual Reviews.

1895,"Establishing Worksite Wellness Programs for North Carolina Government Employees, 2008","Background State employee health plans sometimes provide worksite wellness programs to reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases among their members, but few offer the comprehensive range of interventions recommended by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services. Community Context North Carolina's State Health Plan for Teachers and State Employees provides health coverage for approximately 665,000 state employees, teachers, retirees, and dependents. Health claims indicate that the prevalence of having at least 1 chronic disease or of being obese is approximately 32% among state employees. Methods The State Health Plan created a partnership with North Carolina's Division of Public Health, Office of State Personnel, and other key state agencies to identify bureaucratic obstacles to providing worksite wellness programs for state employees and to develop a state policy to address them. The Division of Public Health established a model worksite program to guide development of the worksite wellness policy and pilot wellness interventions. Outcome The state's first worksite wellness policy created an employee wellness infrastructure in state government and addressed administrative barriers to allow effective worksite wellness interventions. For example, the policy led to pilot implementation of a subsidized worksite weight management program. Positive results of the program helped generate legislative support to expand the weight management program throughout state government. Interpretation Strong interagency partnership is essential to guide worksite wellness policy and program development in state government. State health plans, public health agencies, and personnel agencies each play a role in that partnership.","Young, S; Halladay, J; Plescia, M; Herget, C; Dunn, C",0,,1448
1896,Evaluating the effectiveness of personal resilience and enrichment programme (PREP) for HIV prevention among female sex workers: a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Female sex workers (FSWs) are often considered as the vector, if not reservoir, of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Building upon the existing evidence on the role of psychological health in sexual health, the aim of this protocol is to describe a trial investigating the effectiveness of the Personal Resilience and Enrichment Programme (PREP), a resilience-promoting intervention that targets at psychological well-being i.e. self-esteem, self-efficacy and coping, to facilitate adaptation and ultimately safe sexual practices among FSWs, which could be an innovative strategy in controlling the spread of these infections.Methods: A total of 132 FSWs will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention or usual care (control) groups in a multi-centred randomised controlled trial. Based on the resilience framework, this intervention is comprised of six weekly sessions focused on the awareness, expression and management of emotions, identifying roles and personal strengths, and effective problem-solving skills. Complex intervention assessment on both intervention process and effectiveness will be adopted when the primary outcome reduction of sexual risk behaviour and other psychological outcomes include their perceived stress, self-esteem, self-efficacy, coping overall resilience, and psychological distress will be measured at baseline, post-treatment and 3-month post-intervention and differences assessed by ANOVA. The relationship of resilience factors, psychological health and HIV preventive behaviours will be evaluated using structural equation modelling.Discussion: It is anticipated that this study will increase our understanding of the relationships between individual resilience attributes, positive adaptation, psychological health and sexual health practices. If successful, this programme will provide an innovative direction for HIV prevention by applying the personal resilience factors to promote both psychological well-being and safe sex for this high risk population.","Yuen, Winnie Wing-Yan; Wong, William Chi-Wai; Tang, Catherine So-Kum; Holroyd, Eleanor; Tiwari, Agnes Fung-Yee; Fong, Daniel Yee-Tak; Chin, Weng Yee",0,10.1186/1471-2458-13-683,1449
1898,Concurrent Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Alcohol Dependence: Predictors and Moderators of Outcome,"Objective: The present study examined predictors and moderators of treatment response among 165 adults meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition criteria for comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol dependence (AD), who were randomized to 24 weeks of Naltrexone (NAL), NAL and prolonged exposure (PE), pill placebo, or pill placebo and PE. All participants received supportive counseling for alcohol use. Method: Six domains of predictors or moderators (23 variables) were evaluated using measures of PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Scale Interview) and AD (days drinking from the timeline follow-back interview) collected every 4 weeks throughout treatment. Multilevel modeling with the Fournier approach was used to evaluate predictors and moderators of rates of symptom improvement and posttreatment outcomes. Results: Combat trauma, sexual assault trauma, and higher baseline anxiety sensitivity predicted slower improvement and poorer PTSD outcome. Combat trauma, White race, and higher baseline drinking severity predicted poorer drinking outcome. PTSD severity moderated the efficacy of PE on PTSD outcomes, such that the benefit of PE over no-PE was greater for participants with higher baseline PTSD severity. Baseline depressive severity moderated the efficacy of PE on drinking outcomes, whereby the benefit of PE over no-PE was greater for participants with higher depressive symptoms. NAL effects were most beneficial for those with the longest duration of AD. Conclusion: These results suggest that concurrent, trauma-focused treatment should be recommended for PTSD-AD patients who present with moderate or severe baseline PTSD and depressive symptoms. Future research should examine the mechanisms underlying poorer outcome among identified subgroups of PTSD-AD patients.","Zandberg L.J., Rosenfield D., McLean C.P., Powers M.B., Asnaani A., Foa E.B.",0,10.1037/ccp0000052,1450
1899,"Stress and Alcohol, Cigarette, and Marijuana Use Among Latino Adolescents in Families with Undocumented Immigrants","Families in which one or more members are undocumented immigrants experience unique hardships. Yet, little is known about stress and substance use among adolescents growing up in these families. The present study examined associations between two sources of adolescent stress (i.e., low parental involvement due to contextual constraints and family economic insecurity) and lifetime alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use among adolescents in families with undocumented members. The sample was comprised of 102 adolescents (10â€“18Â years old) and one of his or her parents. Participants responded a survey in English or Spanish. Adolescent lifetime use of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana was 51, 32.4, and 37.3Â %, respectively. Chi-square analyses found no significant gender differences in lifetime substance use. Logistic regression models showed that adolescent stress due to hindered parental involvement increased the odds of both lifetime cigarette and marijuana use after controlling for gender, age, linguistic acculturation, familism, parental control, and negative peer affiliation. Being a girl increased the odds of lifetime alcohol use. Family economic stress was not associated with lifetime substance use. Results suggest that hindered parental involvement might be a stressor and a risk factor for cigarette and marijuana use among adolescents growing up in families with undocumented members. Because parents in these families are likely to be undocumented, policies that allow immigrants to apply for legal status could improve parentsâ€™ working conditions and facilitate parental involvement; in turn, such policies could decrease the risk for adolescent substance use among children of Latino immigrants.

1901,Distress screening: An opportunity for enhancing quality cancer care and promoting the oncology social work profession,"Throughout its history, social work has played a critical role in major client/patient care initiatives because of its unique perspective, wisdom, and skills. The new screening standards set forth by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer place oncology social workers at the forefront of developing and implementing procedures for distress screening. Our profession is again challenged to work across disciplines and change systems of care to improve the health and welfare of patients with cancer and their families. Indeed, emerging research suggests that the use of psychosocial screening instruments results in reductions in emotional distress, better quality of life, and improved patient-provider communication. As an introduction to this special issue on distress screening, this article offers a brief overview of issues related to distress screening that are covered by papers authored in this special issue by Association of Oncology Social Work members. Topics addressed include a review of the historical context driving distress screening implementation, barriers and challenges to oncology social workers trying to implement distress screening, statistical and cultural considerations for selecting screening tools, best practice models, and future considerations. This special issue is intended to be a primer and serves to promote oncology social workers involvement and leadership in the development and implementation of distress screening.

1902,"Are leaders' well-being, behaviours and style associated with the affective well-being of their employees? A systematic review of three decades of research","This study is an overview of published empirical research on the impact of leaders and leadership styles on employee stress and affective well-being. A computerized search and systematic review of nearly 30 years of empirical research was conducted. Forty-nine papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria, which include the requirements for papers to report empirical studies and to be published during the period 1980 to 2009 in English-language peer-reviewed journals. The studies were mostly cross-sectional (43/49 papers) and examined the impact of leaders' stress (4 papers), leaders' behaviours (e.g. support, consideration and empowerment) (30 papers) and specific leadership styles (20 papers) on employees' stress and affective well-being. Three research questions were addressed. The review found some support for leader stress and affective well-being being associated with employee stress and affective well-being. Leader behaviours, the relationship between leaders and their employees and specific leadership styles were all associated with employee stress and affective well-being. It is recommended that future studies include more qualitative data, use standardize questionnaires and examine the processes linking leaders with employee stress. This may lead to effective interventions. Â© 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Skakon J., Nielsen K., Borg V., Guzman J.",1,10.1080/02678373.2010.495262,1453
1903,Couple relationship education: A randomized controlled trial of professional contact and self-directed tools,"The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to examine the efficacy of an evidence-based relationship distress prevention program, the Couples Coping Enhancement Training (CCET), in dual well-earning couples and to investigate whether effects vary by (a) hours of professional contact and (b) mode of delivery (face to face vs. self-learning DVD). N = 159 couples were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 intervention conditions: (1) standard CCET (15 hours face to face), (2) compact CCET (12 hr face to face), (3) short CCET (self-learning DVD + 8 hr face to face), or (4) wait-list control group. Relationship satisfaction and dyadic coping skills were assessed by means of questionnaires completed prior to and 2 weeks after completion of the treatment, at 3-month follow-up, and at 6-month follow-up. Baseline latent change models for 2 factors showed that the CCET enhanced relationship satisfaction and dyadic coping skills in couples relative to the wait-list control group, albeit effects were small. The standard format of the CCET was not more effective than the compact or the short format indicating that reduced amount of professional contact did not decrease the treatment's efficacy and that the self-learning DVD successfully replaced the psycho-educational part of the program. Since dual earner couples usually face multiple stressors, it is a promising finding that they can strengthen their relationship with a relatively short time investment.

1905,"Depression, suicidal ideation, and related factors of methadone maintenance treatment users in Guangzhou, China","ABSTRACT: Mental health problems are prevalent among drug users. Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) is an evidence-based effective treatment for drug addiction; however, there are few studies investigating depression, suicidal ideation, and their related factors among MMT users. In this cross-sectional study, 648 MMT users were recruited from six MMT clinics in Guangzhou, China. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews by trained interviewers. Of all participants, 270 (42.7%) exhibited probable depression (Depression Subscale of the Chinese short version of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-D), score â‰¥ 10) and 99 (15.3%) reported having suicidal ideation in the last six months. After adjusting for significant socio-demographic characteristics, all studied variables, including drug use history, social support, family support for MMT use, and satisfaction toward MMT services were significantly associated with both probable depression and suicidal ideation in the last six months. Furthermore, depression fully mediated the associations between drug use history, satisfaction toward MMT services, and suicidal ideation. In the final multivariate models, probable depression was associated with social support (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.83â€“0.93) and satisfaction toward MMT services provided by doctors (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.40â€“0.86), while for suicidal ideation, social support (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.78â€“0.92) and probable depression (OR = 5.94, 95% CI = 3.39â€“10.42) were significant. The findings suggest that there are unmet mental health needs among MMT users. For countries with limited resources of psychological services, mental health care toward MMT users should be implanted into current health care settings and incorporate components such as social support, family's understanding of MMT, and service satisfaction.

1906,"The effect of a smartphone-based coronary heart disease prevention (SBCHDP) programme on awareness and knowledge of CHD, stress, and cardiac-related lifestyle behaviours among the working population in Singapore: a pilot randomised controlled trial","Background: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most prevalent type of cardiac disease among adults worldwide, including those in Singapore. Most of its risk factors, such as smoking, physical inactivity and high blood pressure, are preventable. mHealth has improved in the last decade, showing promising results in chronic disease prevention and health promotion worldwide. Our aim was to develop and examine the effect of a 4-week Smartphone-Based Coronary Heart Disease Prevention (SBCHDP) programme in improving awareness and knowledge of CHD, perceived stress as well as cardiac-related lifestyle behaviours in the working population of Singapore. Methods: The smartphone app ""Care4Heart"" was developed as the main component of the programme. App content was reviewed and validated by a panel of experts, including two cardiologists and two experienced cardiology-trained nurses. A pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted. Eighty working people were recruited and randomised to either the intervention group (n = 40) or the control group (n = 40). The intervention group underwent a 4-week SBCHDP programme, whereas the control group were offered health promotion websites only. The participants' CHD knowledge, perceived stress and behavioural risk factors were measured at baseline and on the 4th week using the Heart Disease Fact Questionnaire-2, Perceived Stress Scale, and Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System. Results: After the SBCHDP programme, participants in the intervention group had a better awareness of CHD being the second leading cause of death in Singapore (chi(2) = 6.486, p = 0.039), a better overall CHD knowledge level (t = 3.171, p = 0.002), and better behaviour concerning blood cholesterol control (chi(2) = 4.54, p = 0.033) than participants in the control group. Conclusion: This pilot study partially confirmed the positive effects of the SBCHDP programme in improving awareness and knowledge of CHD among the working population. Due to the small sample size and short follow-up period, this study was underpowered to detect significant differences between groups. A full-scale longitudinal study is required in the future to confirm the effectiveness of the SBCHDP programme.","Zhang, H; Jiang, Y; Nguyen, HD; Poo, DCC; Wang, WR",0,10.1186/s12955-017-0623-y,1456
1907,Evaluation of a Carbon Dioxide Personal Cooling Device for Workers in Hot Environments,"This study tested the effectiveness of a carbon dioxide cooling device in reducing heat strain for workers in a hot and humid environment. Ten participants completed two trials in an environment of 30 degrees C WBGT (75% relative humidity) with a novel liquid carbon dioxide cooling shirt (CC) or no cooling (NC) in a randomized order. Mean time-weighted workload for each individual equaled 465 W (400 Kcals center dot h-1). In the CC condition, the work time was significantly increased by 32% (97 +/- 36 min) compared with NC (74 +/- 26 min) (p 0.05). There was no significant difference in mean skin temperature over the trials. Rectal temperature (Tre) was significantly different after 50 min (p 0.05). Mean heart rate, the delta Tre increase rate, and heat storage at 55 min (last point with n = 8) were significantly lower in CC (p 0.05). Overall heat storage was 54 +/- 41 W and 72 +/- 40 W for CC and NC, respectively (p 0.05). Participants also indicated favorable subjective responses for CC vs. NC (p 0.05). These findings suggest that this novel cooling device would effectively attenuate heat strain and increase work productivity for personnel working in a hot and humid environment. Practical aspects of use such as cost, convenience, weight, cooling duration, and rise in ambient CO2 concentration in confined spaces must also be considered.","Zhang, Yang; Bishop, Phillip A.; Green, James Matthew; Richardson, Mark T.; Schumacker, Randall E.",0,10.1080/15459621003785554,1457

However, rates of treatment-seeking among military personnel are relatively low, and the military environment poses several obstacles to engaging in effective clinical interventions. The current paper first reviews barriers and facilitators of treatment-seeking and engagement among military personnel, including stigma, practical barriers, perceptions of mental health problems, and attitudes towards treatment. Next, this paper reviews treatment adaptations and other interventions that are intended to reduce barriers to care among active duty and returning military personnel. These include early interventions, brief formats, integrating clinicians into the medical and military context, technology-based interventions, addressing negative treatment perceptions, screening/early identification, and enlisting unit support.

1910,Virtual Reality and Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Driving Anxiety and Aggression in Veterans: A Pilot Study,"Within the U.S. military, motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) are the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality. Prior combat exposure and anxiety symptoms are associated with risky and aggressive driving, which is responsible for over half of MVA fatalities. Therefore, interventions are needed to reduce driving anxiety and aggression in veterans in order to mitigate the public health impact of MVAs. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) offers safe, controlled exposure to distressing stimuli. The current study piloted a novel virtual reality and cognitive behavioral intervention (VRET + CBT) for veterans that integrated both anxiety and anger management components. Virtual reality driving scenarios were delivered in a driving simulator and tailored for the military population. Six previously deployed veterans completed eight intervention sessions, as well as pre/post, one month follow-up and six to nine month follow-up assessments. Repeated measures ANOVAs demonstrated significant decline and large effect sizes for PTSD symptoms, driving phobia, hyperarousal in driving situations, anxiety/anger-related thoughts and behaviors, and risky driving. Hyperarousal in driving situations declined by 69%, aggressive driving declined by 29%, and risky driving declined by 21%. Treatment gains were maintained at follow-up. Recruitment, retention, immersion, simulator sickness scores, and qualitative feedback demonstrated feasibility of the intervention. Implications for future research and adaptation are discussed.

Existing research indicates that female veterans experience higher rates of trauma exposure in comparison to the general population. Emerging data also suggest that female veterans may be as likely to be exposed to combat as male veterans, although not as directly or as frequently. Female veterans also report high rates of posttraumatic stress disorder, which has been associated with poor psychiatric and physical functioning. Although sexual assault history has been related to increased medical service use, further research is needed to understand relationships between trauma history and patterns of medical and mental health service use. Researchers also are encouraged to employ standardized definitions of trauma and to investigate new areas, such as treatment outcomes and mediators of trauma and health.

1912,"Driving Aggression and Anxiety: Intersections, Assessment, and Interventions","Objective: Driving aggression and anxiety are significant contributors to risky driving and motor vehicle crashes (MVCs), which are leading causes of U.S. morbidity and mortality. Even though aggression and anxiety can be conceptualized as related features of the fight-or-flight response, literature on these topics has not been integrated. Driving aggression and anxiety are also transdiagnostic constructs that span multiple psychiatric disorders. Assessment and treatment of these complex problems must be understood to reduce the public health burden of MVCs. Method: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PsycInfo and Google Scholar. Results: Definitions and prevalence of constructs including driving anger, aggressive driving, posttraumatic stress disorder, driving phobia, and transdiagnostic factors are delineated. Psychosocial correlates and assessment instruments are reviewed. Theoretical models that explicate personological, affective, cognitive, and behavioral components are explored. Differential and shared processes underlying driving aggression and anxiety are examined. Interventions are described, with a focus on promising cognitive-behavioral methods. Conclusion: Driving aggression and anxiety likely share affective and cognitive characteristics such as emotional reactivity and distorted threat appraisals. Further research is needed to support theoretical models linking driving aggression and anxiety, and to validate assessment instruments that capture both constructs. Epidemiologic studies are needed to determine norms, prevalence, and clinical cutpoints. Integration of interventions for these interrelated problems could ultimately reduce risky driving and MVCs.

1913,Current status on behavioral and biological markers of PTSD: A search for clarity in a conflicting literature,"Extensive research has identified stereotypic behavioral and biological abnormalities in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as heightened autonomic activity, an exaggerated startle response, reduced basal cortisol levels and cognitive impairments. We have reviewed primary research in this area, noting that factors involved in the susceptibility and expression of PTSD symptoms are more complex and heterogeneous than is commonly stated, with extensive findings which are inconsistent with the stereotypic behavioral and biological profile of the PTSD patient. A thorough assessment of the literature indicates that interactions among myriad susceptibility factors, including social support, early life stress, sex, age, peri- and post-traumatic dissociation, cognitive appraisal of trauma, neuroendocrine abnormalities and gene polymorphisms, in conjunction with the inconsistent expression of the disorder across studies, confounds attempts to characterize PTSD as a monolithic disorder. Overall, our assessment of the literature addresses the great challenge in developing a behavioral and biomarker-based diagnosis of PTSD.

However, most workers are still sedentary throughout the day-a major contributor to individual weight gain. The current study sought to gather preliminary evidence of the efficacy of active workstations, which are a possible intervention that could increase employees' physical activity while they are working. We conducted an experimental study, in which boredom, task satisfaction, stress, arousal, and performance were evaluated and compared across 4 randomly assigned conditions: seated workstation, standing workstation, cycling workstation, and walking workstation. Additionally, body mass index (BMI) and exercise habits were examined as moderators to determine whether differences in these variables would relate to increased benefits in active conditions. The results (n = 180) showed general support for the benefits of walking workstations, whereby participants in the walking condition had higher satisfaction and arousal and experienced less boredom and stress than those in the passive conditions. Cycling workstations, on the other hand, tended to relate to reduced satisfaction and performance when compared with other conditions. The moderators did not impact these relationships, indicating that walking workstations might have psychological benefits to individuals, regardless of BMI and exercise habits. The results of this study are a preliminary step in understanding the work implications of active workstations.

1915,Preventing Secondary Traumatization in the Undergraduate Classroom: Lessons From Theory and Clinical Practice,"Indirect exposure to traumatic events or to survivors of trauma can itself be traumatizing and lead to symptoms similar to those of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a phenomenon known as secondary traumatization. Undergraduate students enrolled in courses on trauma are potentially vulnerable to secondary traumatization, although no research on them has been conducted. Literature on trauma therapy and the prevention of secondary traumatization is reviewed and suggestions are made for generalizing those findings to the university classroom. Issues of trauma exposure, safety, education, self-care, empowerment, and social support are discussed.","Zurbriggen, Eileen L.",0,10.1037/a0024913,1465
1916,Teacher stress questionnaire: Validity and reliability study in Italy,This study analyses the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Teacher Stress Questionnaire elaborated in England by Travers and Cooper in 1996. This Italian survey was completed by 863 teachers randomly drawn from a cross-section of Italian school levels. The construct validity of the questionnaire was verified by factor analysis and by measuring the internal consistency of the single scales. All dimensions measured by the Teacher Stress Questionnaire were compared for sample subgroups of all teacher levels. Several meaningful and reliable factors emerged from the factor analysis of the scales. The internal consistency of each scale (Cronbach's Î±) revealed satisfactory values. Teachers' age and school level were determining factors for all dimensions of stress explored. The Italian version of the Teacher Stress Questionnaire showed satisfactory psychometric properties and constitutes a useful and reliable measure to analyse stress in Italian schools.

1918,Posttraumatic stress symptoms and smoking among World Trade Center disaster responders: A longitudinal investigation,"Purpose The current longitudinal study examined posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity in relation to smoking abstinence and reduction over time among responders to the World Trade Center (WTC) disaster. Method Participants were 763 police and 1881 non-traditional (e.g., construction workers) WTC responders who reported being smokers at an initial examination obtained between July 2002 and July 2011 at the WTC Health Program (WTC-HP). WTC responders were reassessed, on average, 2.5 years later. Results For police WTC responders, higher levels of WTC-related PTSD symptoms at the initial visit were associated with a decreased likelihood of smoking abstinence (OR = 0.98, p =.002) and with decreased smoking reduction (Î² = -.06, p =.012) at the follow-up visit. WTC-related PTSD symptom severity was not related to likelihood of smoking abstinence or change in number of cigarettes smoked among non-traditional responders. Post hoc analyses suggested that for police, hyperarousal PTSD symptoms were predictive of decreased abstinence likelihood at the follow-up visit (OR = 0.56, p =.006). Discussion The present findings suggest that PTSD symptoms may be differentially related to smoking behavior among police and non-traditional WTC responders in a naturalistic, longitudinal investigation. Future work may benefit from exploring further which aspects of PTSD (as compared to each other and to common variance) explain smoking maintenance. Ã¯Â¿Â½ 2015 Elsevier Inc.

1919,Selenium interactions and toxicity: a review Selenium interactions and toxicity,"Selenium is an essential trace element for mammals. Through selenoproteins, this mineral participates in various biological processes such as antioxidant defence, thyroid hormone production, and immune responses. Some reports indicate that a human organism deficient in selenium may be prone to certain diseases. Adverse health effects following selenium overexposure, although very rare, have been found in animals and people. Contrary to selenium, arsenic and cadmium are regarded as toxic elements. Both are environmental and industrial pollutants, and exposure to excessive amounts of arsenic or cadmium can pose a threat to many people's health, especially those living in polluted regions. Two other elements, vanadium and chromium(III) in trace amounts are believed to play essential physiological functions in mammals. This review summarizes recent studies on selenium interactions with arsenic and cadmium and selenium interactions with vanadium and chromium in mammals. Human studies have demonstrated that selenium may reduce arsenic accumulation in the organism and protect against arsenic-related skin lesions. Selenium was found to antagonise the prooxidant and genotoxic effects of arsenic in rodents and cell cultures. Also, studies on selenium effects against oxidative stress induced by cadmium in various animal tissues produced promising results. Reports suggest that selenium protection against toxicity of arsenic and cadmium is mediated via sequestration of these elements into biologically inert conjugates. Selenium-dependent antioxidant enzymes probably play a secondary role in arsenic and cadmium detoxification. So far, few studies have evaluated selenium effects on chromium(III) and vanadium actions in mammals. Still, they show that selenium may interact with these minerals. Taken together, the recent findings regarding selenium interaction with other elements extend our understanding of selenium biological functions and highlight selenium as a potential countermeasure against toxicity induced by arsenic and cadmium.","Zwolak, Iwona; Zaporowska, Halina",0,10.1007/s10565-011-9203-9,1468
1920,Caregiver- and patient-directed interventions for dementia: an evidence-based analysis.,"UNLABELLED: In early August 2007, the Medical Advisory Secretariat began work on the Aging in the Community project, an evidence-based review of the literature surrounding healthy aging in the community. The Health System Strategy Division at the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care subsequently asked the secretariat to provide an evidentiary platform for the ministry's newly released Aging at Home Strategy.After a broad literature review and consultation with experts, the secretariat identified 4 key areas that strongly predict an elderly person's transition from independent community living to a long-term care home. Evidence-based analyses have been prepared for each of these 4 areas: falls and fall-related injuries, urinary incontinence, dementia, and social isolation. For the first area, falls and fall-related injuries, an economic model is described in a separate report.Please visit the Medical Advisory Secretariat Web site, http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/mas_about.html, to review these titles within the Aging in the Community series.AGING IN THE COMMUNITY: Summary of Evidence-Based AnalysesPrevention of Falls and Fall-Related Injuries in Community-Dwelling Seniors: An Evidence-Based AnalysisBehavioural Interventions for Urinary Incontinence in Community-Dwelling Seniors: An Evidence-Based AnalysisCaregiver- and Patient-Directed Interventions for Dementia: An Evidence-Based AnalysisSocial Isolation in Community-Dwelling Seniors: An Evidence-Based AnalysisThe Falls/Fractures Economic Model in Ontario Residents Aged 65 Years and Over (FEMOR)This report features the evidence-based analysis on caregiver- and patient-directed interventions for dementia and is broken down into 4 sections: IntroductionCaregiver-Directed Interventions for DementiaPatient-Directed Interventions for DementiaEconomic Analysis of Caregiver- and Patient-Directed Interventions for Dementia CAREGIVER-DIRECTED INTERVENTIONS FOR DEMENTIA:OBJECTIVE: To identify interventions that may be effective in supporting the well-being of unpaid caregivers of seniors with dementia living in the community.CLINICAL NEED: TARGET POPULATION AND CONDITION Dementia is a progressive and largely irreversible syndrome that is characterized by a loss of cognitive function severe enough to impact social or occupational functioning. The components of cognitive function affected include memory and learning, attention, concentration and orientation, problem-solving, calculation, language, and geographic orientation. Dementia was identified as one of the key predictors in a senior's transition from independent community living to admission to a long-term care (LTC) home, in that approximately 90% of individuals diagnosed with dementia will be institutionalized before death. In addition, cognitive decline linked to dementia is one of the most commonly cited reasons for institutionalization. Prevalence estimates of dementia in the Ontario population have largely been extrapolated from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging conducted in 1991. Based on these estimates, it is projected that there will be approximately 165,000 dementia cases in Ontario in the year 2008, and by 2010 the number of cases will increase by nearly 17% over 2005 levels. By 2020 the number of cases is expected to increase by nearly 55%, due to a rise in the number of people in the age categories with the highest prevalence (85+). With the increase in the aging population, dementia will continue to have a significant economic impact on the Canadian health care system. In 1991, the total costs associated with dementia in Canada were $3.9 billion (Cdn) with $2.18 billion coming from LTC. Caregivers play a crucial role in the management of individuals with dementia because of the high level of dependency and morbidity associated with the condition. It has been documented that a greater demand is faced by dementia caregivers compared with caregivers of persons with other chronic diseases. The increased burden of caregiving contributes to a host of chronic health problems seen among many informal caregivers of persons with dementia. Much of this burden results from managing the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), which have been established as a predictor of institutionalization for elderly patients with dementia. It is recognized that for some patients with dementia, an LTC facility can provide the most appropriate care; however, many patients move into LTC unnecessarily. For individuals with dementia to remain in the community longer, caregivers require many types of formal and informal support services to alleviate the stress of caregiving. These include both respite care and psychosocial interventions. Psychosocial interventions encompass a broad range of interventions such as psychoeducational interventions, counseling, supportive therapy, and behavioural interventions. Assuming that 50% of persons with dementia live in the community, a conservative estimate of the number of informal caregivers in Ontario is 82,500. Accounting for the fact that 29% of people with dementia live alone, this leaves a remaining estimate of 58,575 Ontarians providing care for a person with dementia with whom they reside. DESCRIPTION OF INTERVENTIONS: The 2 main categories of caregiver-directed interventions examined in this review are respite care and psychosocial interventions. Respite care is defined as a break or relief for the caregiver. In most cases, respite is provided in the home, through day programs, or at institutions (usually 30 days or less). Depending on a caregiver's needs, respite services will vary in delivery and duration. Respite care is carried out by a variety of individuals, including paid staff, volunteers, family, or friends. Psychosocial interventions encompass a broad range of interventions and have been classified in various ways in the literature. This review will examine educational, behavioural, dementia-specific, supportive, and coping interventions. The analysis focuses on behavioural interventions, that is, those designed to help the caregiver manage BPSD. As described earlier, BPSD are one of the most challenging aspects of caring for a senior with dementia, causing an increase in caregiver burden. The analysis also examines multicomponent interventions, which include at least 2 of the above-mentioned interventions. METHODS OF EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: A comprehensive search strategy was used to identify systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of interventions for caregivers of dementia patients.QUESTIONS: Section 2.1 Are respite care services effective in supporting the well-being of unpaid caregivers of seniors with dementia in the community?Do respite care services impact on rates of institutionalization of these seniors?Section 2.2 Which psychosocial interventions are effective in supporting the well-being of unpaid caregivers of seniors with dementia in the community?Which interventions reduce the risk for institutionalization of seniors with dementia?OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: any quantitative measure of caregiver psychological health, including caregiver burden, depression, quality of life, well-being, strain, mastery (taking control of one's situation), reactivity to behaviour problems, etc.;rate of institutionalization; andcost-effectiveness.ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: The quality of the evidence was assessed as High, Moderate, Low, or Very low according to the GRADE methodology and GRADE Working Group. As per GRADE the following definitions apply: HighFurther research is very unlikely to change confidence in the estimate of effect.ModerateFurther research is likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.LowFurther research is very likely to have an important impact on confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.Very lowAny estimate of effect is very uncertain.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Conclusions in Table 1 are drawn from Sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the report. Executive Summary Table 1:Summary of Conclusions on Caregiver-Directed InterventionsSectionInterventionConclusion2.1Respite care for dementia caregiversAssessing the efficacy of respite care services using standard evidence-based approaches is difficult.There is limited evidence from RCTs that respite care is effective in improving outcomes for those caring for seniors with dementia.There is considerable qualitative evidence of the perceived benefits of respite care.Respite care is known as one of the key formal support services for alleviating caregiver burden in those caring for dementia patients.Respite care services need to be tailored to individual caregiver needs as there are vast differences among caregivers and patients with dementia (severity, type of dementia, amount of informal/formal support available, housing situation, etc.)2.2aBehaviourai interventions (individual ≥ 6 sessions)There is moderate- to high-quality evidence that individual behavioural interventions (≥ 6 sessions), directed towards the caregiver (or combined with the patient) are effective in improving psychological health in dementia caregivers.2.2bMulticomponent interventionsThere is moderate- to high-quality evidence that multicomponent interventions improve caregiver psychosocial health and may affect rates of institutionalization of dementia patients.RCT indicates randomized controlled trial.

The study enrolled 280 employee participants in a 3-year cluster randomized, controlled trial conducted at The University of Iowa, 5 local businesses, and 1 regional business. Our results showed a 90% retention rate with lower estimated absenteeism (although not statistically significant) in the intervention group compared with the control group. This type of highly interactive and integrated short intervention has the capacity to result in high levels of participation with the potential to reduce absenteeism.","Snetselaar, Linda; Ahrens, Lois; Johnston, Kenton; Smith, Karen; Hollinger, Donna; Hockenberry, Jason",1,10.1097/TIN.0000000000000056,1470
1925,The Effect of Tailored Web-Based Feedback and Optional Telephone Coaching on Health Improvements: A Randomized Intervention Among Employees in the Transport Service Industry,"Background: Lifestyle-related health problems are an important health concern in the transport service industry. Web-and telephone-based interventions could be suitable for this target group requiring tailored approaches.Objective: To evaluate the effect of tailored Web-based health feedback and optional telephone coaching to improve lifestyle factors (body mass index-BMI, dietary intake, physical activity, stress, sleep, tobacco and alcohol consumption, disease history, self-perceived health, and motivation to change health habits), in comparison to no health feedback or telephone coaching.Methods: Overall, 3,876 employees in the Swedish transport services were emailed a Web-based questionnaire. They were randomized into: control group (group A, 498 of 1238 answered, 40.23%), or intervention Web (group B, 482 of 1305 answered, 36.93%), or intervention Web + telephone (group C, 493 of 1333 answered, 36.98%). All groups received an identical questionnaire, only the interventions differed. Group B received tailored Web-based health feedback, and group C received tailored Web-based health feedback + optional telephone coaching if the participants' reported health habits did not meet the national guidelines, or if they expressed motivation to change health habits. The Web-based feedback was fully automated. Telephone coaching was performed by trained health counselors. Nine months later, all participants received a follow-up questionnaire and intervention Web + telephone. Descriptive statistics, the chi-square test, analysis of variance, and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were used.Results: Overall, 981 of 1473 (66.60%) employees participated at baseline (men: 66.7%, mean age: 44 years, mean BMI: 26.4 kg/m2) and follow-up. No significant differences were found in reported health habits between the 3 groups over time. However, significant changes were found in motivation to change. The intervention groups reported higher motivation to improve dietary habits (144 of 301 participants, 47.8%, and 165 of 324 participants, 50.9%, for groups B and C, respectively) and physical activity habits (181 of 301 participants, 60.1%, and 207 of 324 participants, 63.9%, for B and C, respectively) compared with the control group A (122 of 356 participants, 34.3%, for diet and 177 of 356 participants, 49.7%, for physical activity). At follow-up, the intervention groups had significantly decreased motivation (group B: P<.001 for change in diet; P<.001 for change in physical activity; group C: P=.007 for change in diet; P<.001 for change in physical activity), whereas the control group reported significantly increased motivation to change diet and physical activity (P<.001 for change in diet; P<.001 for change in physical activity).Conclusion: Tailored Web-based health feedback and the offering of optional telephone coaching did not have a positive health effect on employees in the transport services. However, our findings suggest an increased short-term motivation to change health behaviors related to diet and physical activity among those receiving tailored Web-based health feedback.","Solenhill, Madeleine; Grotta, Alessandra; Pasquali, Elena; Bakkman, Linda; Bellocco, Rino; Lagerros, Ylva Trolle",1,10.2196/jmir.4005,1471
1927,Effects of internet-based self-efficacy intervention on secondary traumatic stress and secondary posttraumatic growth among health and human services professionals exposed to indirect trauma,"Background: Although the evidence for the associations among self-efficacy, secondary traumatic stress (STS) and secondary posttraumatic growth (SPTG) is mounting, there is a lack of the experimental evidence for the influence of self-efficacy on positive and negative mental health outcomes among professionals indirectly exposed to trauma. Purpose: This study investigated the effects of an internet-based self-efficacy intervention (the experimental condition), compared to an education (the active control condition) on STS and SPTG among workers exposed to traumatic events indirectly, through their clients. We hypothesized that the group assignment (experimental vs. control) would affect STS and SPTG indirectly, with a mediating role of self-efficacy beliefs. Methods: Participants were 168 health and human services professionals (78% women), exposed indirectly to a traumatic event at work. They were randomly assigned to either a 4-session internet-based self-efficacy intervention (n = 87) or an education control group (n = 81) which received information about coping resources and consequences of stressors at work or at home. STS, SPTG, and self-efficacy were measured at the baseline (Time 1), 1-month follow-up (Time 2) and 2-month follow-up (Time 3). Results: Analysis of covariance showed that the group assignment had a significant effect on STS (Time 2) and self-efficacy (Time 2), with lower STS and higher self-efficacy reported by the self-efficacy intervention participants. Compared to the experimental group, the active control (education) group participants reported higher SPTG at Time 2. Mediation analyses indicated that the group assignment had indirect effects on STS and SPTG at Time 3. Workers who experienced increases in self-efficacy (Time 2) through the intervention were more likely to report lower STS and higher SPTG at Time 3. Conclusion: Elucidating the mediating processes that explain why an intervention for secondary trauma works is essential in order to develop more effective support systems that promote improved mental health outcomes among health and human services professionals. Prevention programs for workers exposed indirectly to traumatic events may target self-efficacy enhancement and education.

Those who participated were eligible for a $350/year insurance premium discount.Results:Employees in the low-income category of $45K or less participated at a higher rate, however, did not lose as much weight as those participants in the higher income categories of $70K or more. We found a positive association with weight loss in two of the categories, reweigh/body mass index, and Weight Watchers/Meal Replacement programs.Conclusion:Wellness programs have a significant impact on employee weight loss, but this relationship may vary across the income level of participants.","Fink, JT; Rich, J; Smith, DR; Singh, M; Sutton, K; Mueller, G; Ihrke, DM; Skalla, JL; Cisler, RA",0,10.1097/JOM.0000000000000893,1473
1930,Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART) program among department of radiology faculty: A pilot randomized clinical trial,"Objective: To test the efficacy of a Stress Management and Resiliency Training (SMART) program for decreasing stress and anxiety and improving resilience and quality of life among Department of Radiology physicians. Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the institutional review board. A total of 26 Department of Radiology physicians were randomized in a single-blind trial to either the SMART program or a wait-list control arm for 12 weeks. The program involved a single 90-min group session in the SMART training with two follow-up phone calls. Primary outcomes measured at baseline and week 12 included the Perceived Stress Scale, Linear Analog Self-Assessment Scale, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Results: A total of 22 physicians completed the study. A statistically significant improvement in perceived stress, anxiety, quality of life, and mindfulness at 12 weeks was observed in the study arm compared to the wait-list control arm; resilience also improved in the active arm, but the changes were not statistically significant when compared to the control arm. Conclusions: A single session to decrease stress among radiologists using the SMART program is feasible. Furthermore, the intervention afforded statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in anxiety, stress, quality of life, and mindful attention. Further studies including larger sample size and longer follow-up are warranted.

1938,Stress management intervention reduces serum cortisol and increases relaxation during treatment for nonmetastatic breast cancer,"Objective: To examine the effects of a cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention, which was composed of relaxation, cognitive restructuring, and coping skills training on late afternoon serum cortisol and relaxation indicators in women who were undergoing treatment for nonmetastatic breast cancer. Methods: Participants (N = 128) were randomly assigned to receive a 10-week CBSM group intervention or a 1-day psychoeducation seminar. Serum cortisol was collected and ability to relax was assessed at study entry and again at 6-and 12-month follow-up visits. Data were analyzed using latent growth curve modeling. Results: There was a significant effect of study condition on change across time for both cortisol and perceived ability to relax. Women receiving CBSM had significantly greater reductions in cortisol levels across the 12 months compared with those in the control group, who had no appreciable decline. Women receiving CBSM reported greater increases in ability to relax than controls across time. Perceived ability to relax did not mediate CBSM-related reductions in cortisol. Conclusions: Women who participate in a 10-week CBSM intervention during treatment for breast cancer show decreases in physiological stress in parallel with increases in perceived relaxation skills. This is the first study demonstrating well-maintained reductions in cortisol after a CBSM intervention in cancer patients during and just after treatment.

1939,"Toxic stress, behavioral health, and the next major era in public health","Before the development of the germ theory in the late 19th century, infectious illnesses were largely uncontrollable and caused significant mortality. Implementing public hygiene, preventive, and treatment interventions created remarkable improvements in population health. Today's U.S. public health crises involve threats to health and human capital evidenced by multiple indicators of deteriorating wellbeing. These problems result from the interaction of risk and protective factors. Specifically, we argue that the interaction of genetic vulnerability and toxic stress are antecedents to a developmental cascade that undermines healthy development and human capital. We review relevant literature, summarize effective strategies to prevent or ameliorate this deterioration, and outline a theory of the mechanisms currently undermining our health. A series of strategies that we believe will constitute the next major era in public health are discussed, involving actions at the individual/family, community and societal level to reduce risk and strengthen protective factors.

1941,The Primary Prevention of PTSD in Firefighters: Preliminary Results of an RCT with 12-Month Follow-Up,"AimTo develop and evaluate an evidence-based and theory driven program for the primary prevention of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).DesignA pre-intervention / post-intervention / follow up control group design with clustered random allocation of participants to groups was used. The ""control"" group received ""Training as Usual"" (TAU).MethodParticipants were 45 career recruits within the recruit school at the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) in Western Australia. The intervention group received a four-hour resilience training intervention (Mental Agility and Psychological Strength training) as part of their recruit training school curriculum. Data was collected at baseline and at 6- and 12-months post intervention.ResultsWe found no evidence that the intervention was effective in the primary prevention of mental health issues, nor did we find any significant impact of MAPS training on social support or coping strategies. A significant difference across conditions in trauma knowledge is indicative of some impact of the MAPS program.ConclusionWhile the key hypotheses were not supported, this study is the first randomised control trial investigating the primary prevention of PTSD. Practical barriers around the implementation of this program, including constraints within the recruit school, may inform the design and implementation of similar programs in the future.","Skeffington, Petra M.; Rees, Clare S.; Mazzucchelli, Trevor G.; Kane, Robert T.",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0155873,1477
1945,A Randomized Control Trial Examining the Effect of Acceptance and Commitment Training on Clinician Willingness to Use Evidence-Based Pharmacotherapy.  [Miscellaneous Article],"This study evaluated the effectiveness of acceptance and commitment training (ACT) for increasing drug and alcohol counselors' willingness to use evidence-based agonist and antagonist pharmacotherapy. Fifty-nine drug and alcohol counselors were randomly assigned to either a 1-day ACT workshop or a 1-day educational control workshop. Both groups then attended a 2-day workshop on empirically supported treatments for substance abuse. Measures were taken at pre- and posttraining and 3-month follow-up on reported use of pharmacotherapy, willingness to use pharmacotherapy, perceived barriers to implementing new treatments, and general acceptance. As compared with those in the education alone condition, participants in the ACT condition showed significantly higher rates of referrals to pharmacotherapy at follow-up, rated barriers to learning new treatments as less believable at posttraining and follow-up, and showed greater psychological flexibility at posttraining and follow-up. Mediational analyses indicated that reduced believability of barriers and greater psychological flexibility mediated the impact of the intervention. Results support the idea that acceptance-based interventions may be helpful in addressing the psychological factors related to poor adoption of evidence-based treatments.

1946,Changing Behavioral Lifestyle Risk Factors Related to Cognitive Decline in Later Life Using a Self-Motivated eHealth Intervention in Dutch Adults,"Background: Our labor force is aging, but aged workers are not yet coached on how to stay cognitively fit for the job.Objective: In this study, we tested whether a self-motivated, complex eHealth intervention could improve multiple health-related behaviors that are associated with cognitive aging among working Dutch adults.Methods: This quasi-experimental prospective study with a pre-post design was conducted with employees of Dutch medium to large companies. All employees with Internet access, a good understanding of the Dutch language, and who provided digital informed consent were eligible to participate. In total, 2972 participants (2110/2972, 71.11% females) with a mean (standard deviation, SD) age of 51.8 (SD 12.9) years were recruited; 2305 became active users of the intervention, and 173 completed the 1-year follow-up. This self-motivated eHealth lifestyle intervention stimulates participants to set personally relevant, monthly health behavior change goals using Goal Attainment Scaling and to realize these goals by implementing behavior change techniques grounded in behavior change theory. The primary outcomes were the goal-setting success rate and the change in overall lifestyle score from baseline to the 1-year follow-up; the score was based on physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol, sleep, and stress scores. The secondary outcomes were the changes in body weight, body mass index, specific lifestyle characteristics, and website usage.Results: A total of 1212 participants set 2620 behavior change goals; 392 participants assessed 1089 (1089/2288, 47.59%) goals and successfully achieved 422 (422/1089, 38.75%) of these goals. Among the goal-setting participants in follow-up, this led to a +0.81-point improvement (95% CI 0.49-1.13, P<.001) in overall lifestyle (d=0.32) and weight loss of 0.62 kg (95% CI -1.16 to -0.07, P=.03). These participants also showed significant improvement in 8 out of 11 specific lifestyle components.Conclusions: Among an adult Dutch population, this eHealth intervention resulted in lifestyle changes in behavioral risk factors associated with cognitive decline, and these improvements lasted over the period of 1 year. Given the general aging of our workforce, this eHealth intervention opens new avenues for the widespread use of cost-effective self-motivated prevention programs aimed at prevention of early-stage cognitive decline and more self-management of their risk factors.","Aalbers, Teun; Qin, Li; Baars, Maria A.

1947,Teachers' perspectives on providing support to children after trauma: A qualitative study,"A considerable number of children are exposed to extreme stressors such as the sudden loss of a loved one, serious traffic accidents, violence, and disaster. In order to facilitate school psychologists' assistance of teachers working with traumatized children, this study aimed to explore elementary school teachers' perspectives. Using a qualitative design, the study explored the perspectives of a purposively varied sample of 21 elementary school teachers (ages 22-55 years; with 0.5-30 years of teaching experience; 5 men). The teachers participated in semistructured interviews, which were transcribed and analyzed in line with the method of ""summative analysis"" by F. Rapport. Even though some teachers expressed confidence in working with children after traumatic exposure and many referred to a supportive atmosphere within the school, the most prominent themes in the participants' narratives reflected uncertainty about, or a struggle with, providing optimal support to children. They searched for a clear role definition as well as a good balance in answering conflicting needs of the exposed children and classmates, wished for better knowledge and skills, and experienced difficulties related to the emotional burden of their work. The findings suggest a need for further research into this understudied topic. In addition, the identified themes can be used by school psychologists to systematically explore individual teachers' strengths and difficulties and to provide them with tailored advice and training.

1948,Biological and psychological markers of stress in humans: Focus on the Trier Social Stress Test,"Validated biological and psychological markers of acute stress in humans are an important tool in translational research. The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), involving public interview and mental arithmetic performance, is among the most popular methods of inducing acute stress in experimental settings, and reliably increases hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation. However, although much research has focused on HPA axis activity, the TSST also affects the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system, the immune system, cardiovascular outputs, gastric function and cognition. We critically assess the utility of different biological and psychological markers, with guidance for future research, and discuss factors which can moderate TSST effects. We outline the effects of the TSST in stress-related disorders, and if these responses can be abrogated by pharmacological and psychological treatments. Modified TSST protocols are discussed, and the TSST is compared to alternative methods of inducing acute stress. Our analysis suggests that multiple readouts are necessary to derive maximum information; this strategy will enhance our understanding of the psychobiology of stress and provide the means to assess novel therapeutic agents.

1949,Pilot study of a cluster randomised trial of a guided e-learning health promotion intervention for managers based on management standards for the improvement of employee well-being and reduction of sickness absence: GEM Study,"Objectives To investigate the feasibility of recruitment, adherence and likely effectiveness of an e-learning intervention for managers to improve employees' well-being and reduce sickness absence.Methods The GEM Study (guided e-learning for managers) was a mixed methods pilot cluster randomised trial. Employees were recruited from four mental health services prior to randomising three services to the intervention and one to no-intervention control. Intervention managers received a facilitated e-learning programme on work-related stress. Main outcomes were Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), 12-item GHQ and sickness absence <21days from human resources. 35 in-depth interviews were undertaken with key informants, managers and employees, and additional observational data collected.Results 424 of 649 (65%) employees approached consented, of whom 350 provided WEMWBS at baseline and 284 at follow-up; 41 managers out of 49 were recruited from the three intervention clusters and 21 adhered to the intervention. WEMWBS scores fell from 50.4-49.0 in the control (n=59) and 51.0-49.9 in the intervention (n=225), giving an intervention effect of 0.5 (95% CI -3.2 to 4.2). 120/225 intervention employees had a manager who was adherent to the intervention. HR data on sickness absence (n=393) showed no evidence of effect. There were no effects on GHQ score or work characteristics. Online quiz knowledge scores increased across the study in adherent managers. Qualitative data provided a rich picture of the context within which the intervention took place and managers' and employees' experiences of it.Conclusions A small benefit from the intervention on well-being was explained by the mixed methods approach, implicating a low intervention uptake by managers and suggesting that education alone may be insufficient. A full trial of the guided e-learning intervention and economic evaluation is feasible. Future research should include more active encouragement of manager motivation, reflection and behaviour change.","Stansfeld, Stephen A.; Kerry, Sally; Chandola, Tarani; Russell, Jill; Berney, Lee; Hounsome, Natalia; Lanz, Doris; Costelloe, Ceire; Smuk, Melanie; Bhui, Kamaldeep",1,10.1136/bmjopen-2015-007981,1482
1950,Let's get physical: A contemporary review of the anxiolytic effects of exercise for anxiety and its disorders,"Research over the past few decades has focused on the therapeutic effects of physical exercise among those affected by mood disorders. Only recently has attention turned to maladaptive and persistent expressions of anxiety, with a growing body of evidence indicating promise for exercise as an effective treatment for some of the anxiety disorders. The current review provides a comprehensive account of contemporary research examining the anxiolytic effects of exercise for anxiety disorders. We synthesize pertinent research regarding the effects of various types of exercise within the different anxiety disorders, consider impact of various types of exercise regimens on anxiety, and examine potential anxiolytic mechanisms responsible for positive mental health gains. We conclude with important considerations for implementing exercise as a treatment for clinically significant anxiety as well as future research directions.

1951,Stress reduction through mindfulness meditation,"Background: This study examined the effects of an 8-week stress reduction program based on training in mindfulness meditation. Previous research efforts suggesting this program may be beneficial in terms of reducing stress-related symptomatology and helping patients cope with chronic pain have been limited by a lack of adequate comparison control groups. Methods: Twenty-eight individuals who volunteered to participate in the present study were randomized into either an experimental group or a nonintervention control group. Results: Following participation, experimental subjects, when compared with controls, evidenced significantly greater changes in terms of: (1) reductions in overall psychological symptomatology; (2) increases in overall domain-specific sense of control and utilization of an accepting or yielding mode of control in their lives, and (3) higher scores on a measure of spiritual experiences. Conclusions: The techniques of mindfulness meditation, with their emphasis on developing detached observation and awareness of the contents of consciousness, may represent a powerful cognitive behavioral coping strategy for transforming the ways in which we respond to life events. They may also have potential for relapse prevention in affective disorders. Â© 1997 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Astin J.A.,0,10.1159/000289116,1484
1952,Psychodynamic psychotherapy versus cognitive behavior therapy for social anxiety disorder: An efficacy and partial effectiveness trial,"Objectives Comparing the overall and differential effects of psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDT) versus cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD). Design Patients with a primary SAD (N = 47) were randomly assigned to PDT (N = 22) or CBT (N = 27). Both PDT and CBT consisted of up to 36 sessions (average PDT 31.4 and CBT 19.8 sessions). Assessments took place at waitlist: pretest, after 12 and 24 weeks for those who received longer treatment: posttest, 3-month and 1-year follow-up. Methods Changes in the main outcome measure self-reported social anxiety composite, as well as in other psychopathology, social skills, negative social beliefs, public self-consciousness, defense mechanisms, personal goals, independent rater's judgments of SAD and general improvement, and approach behavior during an objective test, were analyzed using multilevel analysis. Results No improvement occurred during waitlist. Treatments were highly efficacious, with large within-subject effect sizes for social anxiety, but no differences between PDT and CBT on general and treatment-specific measures occurred. Remission rates were over 50% and similar for PDT and CBT. Personality disorders did not influence the effects of PDT or CBT. Conclusions PDT and CBT are both effective approaches for SAD. Further research is needed on the cost-effectiveness of PDT versus CBT, on different lengths PDT, and on patient preferences and their relationship to outcome of PDT versus CBT.

1954,Direct and indirect costs in persons with chronic back pain and comorbid mental disorders-A systematic review,"Objective: Direct inpatient and outpatient healthcare costs as well as indirect costs (e.g. productivity losses) are hypothesized to be increased in chronic back pain (CBP) patients with mental disorders. The aim of this systematic review is to examine this hypothesis by comparing costs in CBP patients with and without mental disorders. Methods: A comprehensive literature search (Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Psyndex, EconLit, IBSS) was conducted. All studies were included which allowed for a comparison of direct and indirect costs between CBP patients with and without mental disorders. Results: Of 2283 potentially relevant articles, 10 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Total healthcare costs (SMD=0.16 [SE=0.06]; n=1), CBP-related healthcare costs (SMD=0.21 [0.06]; n=1), CBP-related primary care visits (OR=1.6 [95%-CI:1.2-2.3]; n=1), CBP-related specialty care visits (OR=1.4 [1.0-2.0]; n=1), CBP-related radiologic procedures (OR=1.6 [1.0-2.5]; n=1) and mental health visits (OR=8.1 [7.3-9.1]; n=2) were increased in CBP patients with depression. The incidence of new surgeries was increased in CBP patients with PTSD (OR=4.2 [1.6-10.8]; n=1). Pain-related healthcare use (n=1) in CBP patients with both depression and anxiety and CBP-related hospital admissions (n=1) in CBP patients with depression were not increased. Regarding indirect costs results were inconsistent for both return to work rates (n=3) and work absence (n=2). Conclusion: The results indicate increased direct but not indirect costs in CBP patients with mental disorders. However, the evidence is limited due to the low number of studies per outcome. This is all the more problematic, since the adequate allocation of healthcare resources will become a major topic of health care policy due to limited resources.

1955,Effects of video-modeling on the interaction skills of first-time fathers of late preterm infants,"This study evaluated the effects of an innovative educational-behavioral intervention for first-time fathers of late preterm (34-36 weeks gestation) infants, with the aim of enhancing the infants environment through strengthening fathers skills in interaction with their young infant. Using a randomized controlled trial, fathers of 111 late preterm infants were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: 2 home visits intervention (n = 46), 4 home visits intervention (n = 23), or comparison (n = 42). Baseline visits occurred when the infant was 4 months old corrected age, with outcome visits at 8 months corrected age. Intervention consisted of video-recording a father-infant play interaction and providing positive feedback and suggestions to enhance the interaction and language development. Fathers in the 4-visit group scored significantly higher than fathers in the comparison group as measured by the Parent Child Interaction Teaching Scale, Parent Total score. There were no differences between groups for scores on the Parenting Stress Index-3 or What Being the Parent of a Baby Is Like - Evaluation subscale. The video self-modeling intervention has promise for enhancing the skills of fathers of late preterm infants. Further research is needed to determine the long-term effects for the father and the child.

1956,Annual research review: Positive adjustment to adversity - Trajectories of minimal-impact resilience and emergent resilience,"Background: Research on resilience in the aftermath of potentially traumatic life events (PTE) is still evolving. For decades, researchers have documented resilience in children exposed to corrosive early environments, such as poverty or chronic maltreatment. Relatively more recently, the study of resilience has migrated to the investigation of isolated PTE in adults. Methods: In this article, we first consider some of the key differences in the conceptualization of resilience following chronic adversity versus resilience following single-incident traumas, and then describe some of the misunderstandings that have developed about these constructs. To organize our discussion, we introduce the terms emergent resilience and minimal-impact resilience to represent trajectories of positive adjustment in these two domains, respectively. Results: We focused in particular on minimal-impact resilience, and reviewed recent advances in statistical modeling of latent trajectories that have informed the most recent research on minimal-impact resilience in both children and adults and the variables that predict it, including demographic variables, exposure, past and current stressors, resources, personality, positive emotion, coping and appraisal, and flexibility in coping and emotion regulation. Conclusions: The research on minimal-impact resilience is nascent. Further research is warranted with implications for a multiple levels of analysis approach to elucidate the processes that may mitigate or modify the impact of a PTE at different developmental stages.

1957,Effects of spiritual mantram repetition on HIV outcomes: A randomized controlled trial,"We examined the efficacy of a psycho-spiritual intervention of mantram repetition-a word or phrase with spiritual associations repeated silently throughout the day-on psychological distress (intrusive thoughts, stress, anxiety, anger, depression), quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction, and existential spiritual well-being in HIV-infected adults. Using a 2-group by 4-time repeated measures design, 93 participants were randomly assigned to mantram (n = 46) or attention control group (n = 47). Over time, the mantram group improved significantly more than the control group in reducing trait-anger and increasing spiritual faith and spiritual connectedness. Actual mantram practice measured by wrist counters was inversely associated with non-HIV related intrusive thoughts and positively associated with quality of life, total existential spiritual well-being, meaning/peace, and spiritual faith. Intent-to-treat findings suggest that a mantram group intervention and actual mantram practice each make unique contributions for managing psychological distress and enhancing existential spiritual well-being in adults living with HIV/AIDS.

1959,Reducing workplace burnout through exercise,"Objectives. The global burden of burnout cost is in excess of $300 billion annually. Locally, just under half of working Australians experience high levels of occupational burnout. Consequently, burnout interventions are paramount to organisational productivity. Exercise has the potential to provide a multilevel and cost effective burnout intervention. The current study aims to extend the literature by comparing cardiovascular with resistance exercise to assess their relative effectiveness against well-being, perceived stress, and burnout. Design. Participants were 49 (36 females and 13 males) previously inactive volunteers ranging in age from 19 to 68 that completed a four week exercise program of either cardiovascular, resistance, or no exercise (control). Randomised control trial design was employed. Method. Participants were measured against the Subjective Exercise Experience Scale, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Results. After four weeks of exercise participants had greater positive well-being and personal accomplishment, and concomitantly less psychological distress, perceived stress, and emotional exhaustion. Cardiovascular exercise was found to increase well-being and decrease psychological distress, perceived stress, and emotional exhaustion. Resistance training was noticeably effective in increasing well-being and personal accomplishment and to reduce perceived stress. The present findings revealed large effect sizes suggesting that exercise may be an effective treatment for burnout. However, given a small sample size further research needs to be conducted. Conclusion. Exercise has potential to be an effective burnout intervention. Different types of exercise may assist employees in different ways. Organisations wishing to proactively reduce burnout can do so by encouraging their employees to access regular exercise programs.

1960,Mediators of physical exercise for improvement in cancer survivors' quality of life,"Objective Mediating mechanisms of a 12-week group-based exercise intervention on cancer survivors' quality of life (QoL) were examined to inform future exercise intervention development. Methods Two hundred nine cancer survivors â‰¥3 months posttreatment (57% breast cancer) aged 49.5 (Â±10.4) years were assigned to physical exercise (n = 147) or wait-list control (n = 62). QoL, fatigue, emotional distress, physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery were assessed at baseline and post-intervention using questionnaires. Path analysis was conducted using Mplus to explore whether improved physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery mediated the effects of exercise on fatigue and distress and consequently QoL. Results The intervention was associated with increased physical activity (Î² = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.14;0.59), general self-efficacy (Î² = 2.41, 95%CI = 0.35;4.73), and mastery (Î² = 1.75, 95%CI = 0.36;2.78). Further, the intervention had both a direct effect on fatigue (Î² = -1.09, 95%CI = -2.12;0.01), and an indirect effect (Î² = -0.54, 95%CI = -1.00;-0.21) via physical activity (Î² = -0.29, 95%CI = -0.64;-0.07) and general self-efficacy (Î² = -0.25, 95%CI = -0.61;-0.05). The intervention had a borderline significant direct effect on reduced distress (Î² =-1.32, 95%CI =-2.68;0.11), and a significant indirect effect via increased general self-efficacy and mastery (Î² =-1.06, 95%CI =-1.89;-0.38). Reductions in fatigue (Î² =-1.33, 95%CI =-1.85;-0.83) and distress (Î² =-0.86, 95%CI =-1.25;-0.52) were associated with improved QoL. Further, increased physical activity was directly associated with improved QoL (Î² = 3.37, 95%CI = 1.01;5.54). Conclusion The beneficial effect of group-based physical exercise on QoL was mediated by increased physical activity, general self-efficacy and mastery, and subsequent reductions in fatigue and distress. In addition to physical activity, future interventions should target self-efficacy and mastery. This may lead to reduced distress and fatigue, and consequently improved QoL of cancer survivors.

1961,Transitions in medicine: Trainee doctor stress and support mechanisms,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to describe experiences of transition from medical school to new doctor in the UK and to examine the development and evaluation of initiatives designed to lessen anxiety and assist transition. Design/methodology/approach: The evaluations of two recent interventions for new doctors are reported, one at organisational and one at the individual level: first, a longer induction programme; and second, provision of a library of medical textbooks on smartphones (the ""iDoc"" project). The paper also reports on mindfulness training designed to help trainees' well-being. Findings: These initiatives address different aspects of transition challenges (related to roles and responsibilities, cognitive and environmental factors). Benefit can be gained from multiple approaches to supporting this time of uncertainty. Practical implications: Given the link between transition, doctor stress and patient safety, there is a need to review existing strategies to ameliorate the stress associated with transition and seek novel ways to support new doctors. The authors argue that diverse approaches, targeted at both the organisational and individual level, can support new trainees, both practically and emotionally. Originality/value: The paper reports initiatives that support transition, of value to medical schools, deaneries, researchers and trainees themselves.

1962,"Meditation's Effect on Attentional Efficiency, Stress, and Mindfulness Characteristics of Nursing Students","Background: Strengthening attention-regulation efficiency of nurse graduates is important to the quality and safety of nursing practice in increasingly complex and cognitively distracting workplaces. Neuroscientific evidence suggests that regular practice of focused meditation can enhance attentional skills. This study explored meditation as an educational strategy for enhancing nursing students' attentional efficiency. Method: A randomized-control trial with 52 prelicensure nursing students examined differences between those who meditated and those who did not on measurements of alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Stress and mindfulness were also explored. Results: Meditation demonstrated moderate strength for enhancing executive attention, F = 4.26 (1, 49), n(2) = .080, p = .044. Additional outcomes specific to the meditation group were reduced stress and increased mindfulness, F = 7.16 (2, 47), n(2) = .234, p = .002. Conclusion: Results support the consideration of meditation training as a strategy for enhancing nursing students' attentional efficiency and other selfregulatory skills necessary for safe nursing practice.","Burger, Kathleen G.; Lockhart, Joan Such",0,10.3928/01484834-20170619-08,1493
1963,The Modulating Role of Stress in the Onset and Course of Tourette's Syndrome: A Review,"Accumulating data indicate a common occurrence of tic exacerbations and periods of psychosocial stress. Patients with Tourette's syndrome (TS) also exhibit aberrant markers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation. Based on these findings, a functional relationship between stress and tic disorders has been suggested, but the underlying mechanism of how stress may affect tic pathology remains to be elucidated. We suggest that dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission as well as immunology play a crucial role in mediating this relationship. Two possibilities of causal direction might be assumed: (a) psychosocial stress might lead to an exacerbation of tics via activation of HPA axis and subsequent changes in neurotransmission or immunology and (b) TS-related abnormalities in neurotransmission or immunology result in a higher vulnerability of affected patients to respond to psychosocial stress with a strong activation of the HPA axis. It may also be the case that both assumptions hold true and interact with each other.

By using a controlled pragmatic trial, a self-help intervention group of meditators was compared with a typical control group listening to relaxing music and a waiting list group. The final sample included 56 Italian workers as participants, block randomized to the three conditions. The self-reported level of perceived stress was assessed at the beginning and at the end of the protocol. Participants were also instructed to track their heart rate before and after each session. The results did not show any significant differences between groups, but both self-help intervention groups demonstrated an improvement in coping with stress. Nevertheless, meditators and music listeners reported a significant decrease in average heartbeats per minute after each session. Furthermore, both groups perceived a moderate but significant change in stress reduction perceptions, even if with some peculiarities. Limitations and opportunities related to the meditation protocol supported by the mobile application to reduce stress are discussed.

1965,The Effectiveness of a Stress Reduction and Burnout Prevention Program A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Outpatient Intervention in a Health Resort Setting,"Background: Chronic psychological distress appears to have increased in recent years, mainly among the working population. The data available indicate that mental and behavioral disorders, including burnout syndrome, represent not only a personal problem for those afflicted, but also a serious public health issue. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of an outpatient burnout prevention program in a mono-center health resort setting.Methods: Adults experiencing an above-average level of stress and thus being at an increased risk of burnout were randomized either to the intervention group (IG) or the waiting control group (WG). The 3-week program included stress management intervention, relaxation, physical exercise and moor applications. The primary outcome was change in perceived stress (PSQ) at 6 months post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included burnout symptoms, well-being, health status, psychological symptoms, back pain, and number of sick days. Participants were examined at baseline, post-intervention (3 weeks) and after 1, 3 and 6 months.Results: Data from 88 adults (IG=43; WG=45) were available for (per protocol) analysis (mean age: 50.85; 76.1% female). Participants in the IG experienced significant immediate improvement in all outcome measures, which declined somewhat during the first three months post-intervention and then remained stable for at least another three months. Those in the WG did not experience substantial change across time. For the 109 randomized persons, results for PSQ were confirmed in an intention-to-treat analysis with missing values replaced by last observation carried forward (between-group ANCOVA for PSQ-Score at 6 months, parameter estimator for the group: -20.57; 95% CI: [-26.09; -15.04]). Large effect sizes (Cohen's d for PSQ: 1.09-1.72) indicate the superiority of the intervention.Conclusions: The program proved to be effective in reducing perceived stress, emotional exhaustion and other targets. Future research should examine the long-term impact of the program and the effect of occasional refresher training.","Stier-Jarmer, Marita; Frisch, Dieter; Oberhauser, Cornelia; Berberich, Goetz; Schuh, Angela",1,10.3238/arztebl.2016.0781,1496
1966,Improving Cardiovascular Recovery From Stress With Brief Poststress Exercise,"Objective: While exercising before a stressor has been shown to limit the magnitude of stress responses, we test the use of exercise as a coping mechanism after the stressor, to limit the duration of the stress response. Design: After doing difficult mental arithmetic with harassment, male and female undergraduates (N = 102) either walked in place or sat still for 3 minutes, then all sat for a recovery period. Main Outcome Measures: Continuous blood pressure and heart rate monitoring was done throughout. Changes from an initial resting baseline were calculated. Results: During the manipulation, blood pressure for exercisers was higher than for controls, but soon after the tasks were completed the participants who had exercised had significantly lower systolic (SBP; M = 3.5 mmHg above prestress baseline, p < .01) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP; M = 0.3 mmHg above prestress baseline, p < .001) than those who had not exercised (SBP: M = 8.8 mmHg, DBP: M = 4.8 mmHg). Conclusion: Although exercising when angry adds to initial cardiovascular arousal, it improves recovery afterward. We discuss possible mechanisms for this effect.

Methods/Design Ten peer volunteers completed training in research protocols and delivering tele-based couples support to men with prostate cancer and their partners. Twenty couples received an eight session intervention and were assessed before surgery and 3 and 6 months subsequently for adjustment outcomes. A focus group investigated the peers' experiences. Results Peers were motivated by altruism, a belief in research, and reported personal growth. The research protocol at times conflicted with lay models of helping, and the focus on sexuality and couples was challenging.

1969,"Infant Mental Health Intervention for Preterm Infants in Japan: Promotions of Maternal Mental Health, Mother-Infant Interactions, and Social Support by Providing Continuous Home Visits until the Corrected Infant Age of 12 Months","The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the Japanese Infant Mental Health Program (JIMHP) for preterm mother-infant dyads until the infants reached 12 months of corrected age. Mothers in the JIMHP group (n = 26) received one hospital visit in addition to standard care in the Growing Care Unit (GCU) and five home visits based on the principles of infant mental health (IMH) after discharge from the hospital, until the infant reached 12 months of corrected age. In contrast, mothers in the control program group (n = 40) received standard care in the GCU and three conventional home visits during the same period. The dyads were then compared across groups, revealing that the JIMHP dyads showed less maternal depressive symptoms, better maternal interaction, increased social support by medical workers and healthcare professionals, a high persistence rate for attending the program, and a more positive perception toward the program (p < .05). However, there were no significant differences in the impact of parenting stress or in child development. These results are discussed in terms of their significance and the practical/clinical availability of IMH principles and the JIMHP as a new support model for preterm infants in Japan.

1970,"Trait emotional intelligence, anxiety sensitivity, and experiential avoidance in stress reactivity and their improvement through psychological methods","Stress pervades daily society, often with deleterious consequences for those prone to react intensely to it. Intervention techniques to attenuate stress reactivity are thus paramount. With that goal in mind, researchers have sought to identify and alter malleable psychological dispositional variables that influence stress reactivity. Trait emotional intelligence (TEI), anxiety sensitivity (AS), and experiential avoidance (EA) are increasingly receiving attention in these research efforts. The self-reported emotional component of stress reactivity has been emphasized in investigations and is our focus. Specifically, this paper overviews the role of TEI, AS, and EA in self-reported stress responses. We also discuss empirically supported psychological methods to adjust suboptimal levels of these variables in normal populations. Both psycho-educational (information, skills) and mindfulness-based interventions (specific mindfulness therapies or components) are covered. Findings include that (1) TEI, AS, and EA are each correlated with the emotional component of stress reactivity to both naturalistic and lab-based stressors; (2) preliminary support currently exists for psycho-educational intervention of TEI and AS but is lacking for EA; (3) adequate evidence supports mindfulness-based interventions to target EA, with very limited but encouraging findings suggesting mindfulness methods improve TEI and AS; and (4) although more research is needed, stress management approaches based on mindfulness may well target all three of these psychological variables and thus appear particularly promising. Encouragingly, some methods to modify dispositional variables (e.g., a mindfulness-based format of guided self-help) are easily disseminated and potentially applicable to the general public.","Choi K., Vickers K., Tassone A.",0,10.5964/ejop.v10i2.754,1501
1971,Reducing occupational stress with a B-vitamin focussed intervention: a randomized clinical trial: study protocol,"Background: Workplace stress in Australia and other western countries has been steadily increasing over the past decade. It can be observed not only in terms of increased compensation claims but also costs due to absenteeism, loss of productivity at work and reduced psychological and physiological health and well-being. Given the cost and pervasive effects of stress in the modern workforce, time efficient and cost-effective interventions capable of reducing occupational stress (or strain) and burnout are urgently required for the improved well-being of stressed employees. One intervention gaining scientific traction is supplementation with nutritional interventions, particularly the B group vitamins.Methods: This study was developed to examine the effects of B group vitamins on workplace stress and mood variables with a sample of full-time employed older adults who subjectively report feeling stressed. The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups clinical trial where 200 (N = 100/group) participants will be randomized to receive Blackmores (R) Executive B Stress Formula or placebo daily for a period of 6 months. Participants will be tested at baseline and 6 months post-randomization on workplace stress, cognitive, personality and mood measures, cardiovascular (brachial and aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressures as well as arterial stiffness), biochemical (assays to measure inflammation and safety) as well as genetic assessments (to assess stress processing) and neuroimaging measures (to investigate in vivo mechanisms of action of B vitamins). In addition to this pre- and post-supplementation testing, participants will also complete a battery of self-report questionnaires online to assess their stress and mood once a month for the duration of the study. The primary aim of the study is to investigate the effects of B vitamin supplementation on work related stress. The secondary aims are to explore the mechanisms underpinning any changes in mood or workplace stress due to the B vitamin intervention by examining relationships between cognitive, biological, neuroimaging and cardiovascular variables over 6 months. A subset of 40 participants (N = 20/group) will undergo neuroimaging at baseline and at 6 months using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in order to further explore in vivo mechanisms of action of B vitamins.","Stough, Con; Simpson, Tamara; Lomas, Justine; McPhee, Grace; Billings, Clare; Myers, Stephen; Oliver, Chris; Downey, Luke A.",1,10.1186/1475-2891-13-122,1502
1972,Association of stress coping strategies with Internet addiction in college students: The moderating effect of depression,"Background This study examined the association between stress-related coping strategies and Internet addiction and the moderating effect of depression in a sample of Taiwanese college students. Method A total of 500 college students (238 men and 262 women) participated in this study. Internet addiction was assessed using the Chen Internet Addiction Scale. Participants' stress coping strategies and depressive symptoms were measured using the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced and the Beck Depression Inventory-II, respectively. We used t and chi-square tests to examine differences in demographic characteristics, depression, and stress coping strategies between participants with and without Internet addiction. Significant variables were used in a logistic regression model to examine the association between stress coping strategies and Internet addiction and the moderating effect of depression on the association. Results Results indicated that use of restraint coping was negatively associated with Internet addiction (odds ratio [OR] = 0.886, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.802-0.977), whereas denial (OR = 1.177, 95% CI: 1.029-1.346) and mental disengagement (OR = 2.673, 95% CI: 1.499-4.767) were positively associated with Internet addiction. Depression had a moderating effect on the association between denial and Internet addiction (OR = 0.701, 95% CI: 0.530-0.927). Conclusions Stress coping strategies and depression are important factors to evaluate when developing intervention programs targeting college undergraduate students with Internet addiction.

1973,Beliefs about medicine and illness are associated with fear of cancer recurrence in women taking adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer,"Objectives Adjuvant endocrine therapy for early-stage breast cancer has greatly reduced the morbidity and mortality associated with breast cancer recurrence. Despite this, a significant proportion of women report fears of cancer recurrence. This study examined the associations between fear of cancer recurrence (FoR) and illness perceptions, medication beliefs, and treatment side effects in women taking adjuvant endocrine therapy following breast cancer. Methods A total of 153 post-menopausal women with early-stage breast cancer completed a postal survey. Analyses were conducted to examine the association between FoR and illness perceptions, medication beliefs, treatment side effects, demographic factors, and emotional distress and to identify which of these factors would be most strongly associated with FoR in a regression model. Results All illness perceptions (apart from personal control) were associated with FoR, as were patient beliefs about endocrine therapy. Although treatment side effects, being unemployed, and higher levels of anxiety and depression were associated with FoR, only illness perceptions (identity, treatment control, timeline, and emotional representation) and medication necessity beliefs were significantly correlated with FoR in the final model. Conclusions It appears that, in addition to directly targeting FoR, it may be worthwhile to address the illness and medication beliefs supporting the fear. Additionally, helping women to differentiate everyday symptoms from those indicative of breast cancer may help to reduce fear of recurrence. Statement of Contribution What is already known on this subject? A significant proportion of women report fear of cancer recurrence following breast cancer. The literature shows that illness perceptions, side effects of treatment, and beliefs about medicines are related to fear of recurrence among cancer patients. However, because these variables have often been looked at in isolation, it is not clear whether some perceptions or cues are more likely to relate to fear of recurrence than others. What does this study add? This study shows illness perceptions and medication beliefs are strongly related to fears of cancer recurrence. The results point to ways in which the self-regulatory model of illness may be used to reduce patients' fear of recurrence. The study results show that women with higher fear of recurrence may be balancing a tension between believing that they need to take the medication to protect their future health alongside concerns that the treatment may not be working.

1974,Brief stress management reduces acute distress and buffers physiological response to a social stress test,"This pilot study examined whether brief 1-session stress management strategies can reduce acute subjective distress and buffer physiological stress responses to a laboratory-based social stress test. We randomized 120 healthy young adults to a brief enhanced-mindfulness intervention, a somatic-relaxation intervention, or an attention-only control group. All participants then underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; Kirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhammer, 1993), a highly standardized and validated laboratory-based social stress induction protocol. We examined acute subjective distress via self-report, as well as salivary assays of cortisol (sCORT) and alpha-amylase (sAA) during the experiment. Participants in the 2 active stress management groups reported significant reductions in subjective distress during the intervention portion compared with the control group. There were also significant group differences for sCORT responsiveness to the TSST favoring the stress management groups. Reductions in subjective distress reported during the brief interventions were significantly associated with attenuation in sCORT response during the TSST. These results provide preliminary evidence that even very brief stress management strategies may be effective in reducing acute distress and also at buffering physiological response during social stress. Practical implications of these findings and future research are discussed.

1975,Trajectories of well-being during an exercise randomized controlled trial: The role of exposure and exercise experiences,"We examined how process factors were related to the development of various indicators of well-being during the course of an exercise randomized controlled trial aimed at reducing fatigue among university students. We investigated (a) whether actual exposure to the exercise sessions was related to differences in students' trajectories of well-being, (b) the minimally required exposure to exercise needed before well-being started to differ between the intervention and control condition, and (c) whether exercise experiences (enjoyment and detachment) were related to differences in well-being trajectories. University students with high levels of fatigue were randomly allocated to a 6-week exercise intervention (nÂ =Â 50) or wait list (nÂ =Â 49). All participants were measured before, 5 times during, and at the end of the intervention period. Multilevel analyses showed that exercisers with high exposure showed an increase in self-efficacy whereas those with low exposure did not. Effects of exercise on well-being became visible after 2 to 4Â weeks during the intervention period and (partly) depended on the extent of psychological detachment. We recommend that both outcomes and process factors throughout the intervention period should be measured in order to better understand â€œwhenâ€ and â€œunder what conditionsâ€ an exercise intervention works.

1976,Pilot Testing of the NURSE Stress Management Intervention,"Student nurses experience significant stress during their education, which may contribute to illness and alterations in health, poor academic performance, and program attrition. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of an innovative stress management program in two baccalaureate nursing programs in Connecticut, named NURSE (Nurture nurse, Use resources, foster Resilience, Stress and Environment management), that assists nursing students to develop stress management plans. An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used to evaluate the effects of the intervention with 40 junior nursing students. Results from this study provide evidence that the NURSE intervention is highly feasible, and support further testing to examine the effect of the intervention in improving stress management in nursing students.

1977,Evaluation of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for life and a cognitive behavioural therapy stress-management workshop to improve healthcare staff stress: study protocol for two randomised controlled trials,"Background: Healthcare workers experience higher levels of work-related stress and higher rates of sickness absence than workers in other sectors. Psychological approaches have potential in providing healthcare workers with the knowledge and skills to recognise stress and to manage stress effectively. The strongest evidence for effectiveness in reducing stress in the workplace is for stress-management courses based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). However, research examining effects of these interventions on sickness absence (an objective indicator of stress) and compassion for others (an indicator of patient care) is limited, as is research on brief CBT stress-management courses (which may be more widely accessible) and on MBIs adapted for workplace settings.Methods/design: This protocol is for two randomised controlled trials with participant preference between the two trials and 1:1 allocation to intervention or wait-list within the preferred choice. The first trial is examining a one-day CBT stress-management workshop and the second trial an 8-session Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Life (MBCT-L) course, with both trials comparing intervention to wait-list. The primary outcome for both trials is stress post-intervention with secondary outcomes being sickness absence, compassion for others, depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, wellbeing, work-related burnout, self-compassion, presenteeism, and mindfulness (MBCT-L only). Both trials aim to recruit 234 staff working in the National Health Service in the UK.Discussion: This trial will examine whether a one-day CBT stress-management workshop and an 8-session MBCT-L course are effective at reducing healthcare staff stress and other mental health outcomes compared to wait-list, and, whether these interventions are effective at reducing sickness absence and presenteeism and at enhancing wellbeing, self-compassion, mindfulness and compassion for others. Findings will help inform approaches offered to reduce healthcare staff stress and other key variables. A note of caution is that individual-level approaches should only be part of the solution to reducing healthcare staff stress within a broader focus on organisational-level interventions and support.","Strauss, Clara; Gu, Jenny; Pitman, Nikki; Chapman, Cavita; Kuyken, Willem; Whittington, Adrian",1,10.1186/s13063-018-2547-1,1508
1978,Self-compassion as an emotion regulation strategy in major depressive disorder,"Cognitive reappraisal and acceptance are two presumably adaptive emotion regulation strategies in depression. More recently, self-compassion has been discussed as another potentially effective strategy for coping with depression. In the present study, we compared the effectiveness of self-compassion with a waiting condition, reappraisal, and acceptance in a clinically depressed sample, and tested the hypothesis that the intensity of depressed mood would moderate the differential efficacy of these strategies. In an experimental design, we induced depressed mood at four points in time in 48 participants meeting criteria for major depressive disorder. After each mood induction, participants were instructed to wait, reappraise the situation, accept their negative emotions, or employ self-compassion to regulate their depressed mood. Self-ratings of depressed mood were assessed before and after each mood induction and regulation phase. Results showed that the reduction of depressed mood was significantly greater in the self-compassion condition than in the waiting condition. No significant differences were observed between the self-compassion and the reappraisal condition, and between the self-compassion and the acceptance condition in patients' mood ratings. However, the intensity of self-rated depressed mood at baseline was found to moderate the comparative effectiveness of self-compassion and reappraisal with a trend of self-compassion being more effective than reappraisal in high depressed mood at baseline. These findings support the use of self-compassion as another adaptive emotion regulation strategy for patients with major depressive disorder, especially for those suffering from high levels of depressed mood.

1979,Mindfulness and Coping with Stress: Do Levels of Perceived Stress Matter?,"Few studies have explored whether mindfulness facilitates more adaptive coping with stress, and the evidence for this is mixed. It may be that mindfulness influences coping responses only among relatively stressed individuals, but this has not been tested. Two randomized controlled experiments (Study 1, N = 204; Study 2, N = 202) tested whether a brief mindfulness induction enhances coping among adults and whether perceived stress moderates these effects. In Study 1, we found that a mindfulness induction produced less self-reported avoidance coping but only among relatively stressed individuals. In Study 2, a mindful acceptance induction produced more approach and less avoidance coping than relaxation and self-affirmation controls, and these effects were strongest among individuals reporting high levels of perceived stress. These findings suggest that perceived stress is an important moderator of the influence of mindfulness upon coping responses.

1980,Effects of acute aerobic exercise or meditation on emotional regulation,"Effective emotional regulation is critical for overall psychological well-being; as such, it is important to investigate potential methods to optimize emotion regulation abilities. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an acute bout of aerobic exercise and meditation on emotional regulation among young adults. Participants (N = 63, mean age = 21.3 yrs) were randomly assigned to stretch (control group, n = 21), walk (n = 21), or meditate (n = 21) for 10-min, after which they were exposed to a film clip (3 min) intended to elicit a negative emotional state (e.g., sadness, anger). Participants then viewed 12 International Affective Picture System images validated to elicit a negative valence. Participantsâ€™ affect (valence and arousal) states were monitored before, during, and after the stretching, walking, and meditation bouts using the Feeling Scale (FS) and Felt Arousal Scale (FAS). Distinct affect was assessed utilizing an affective circumplex measure before and after the stretch/walk/meditation bout, as well as following the film clip and image viewing. A significant group Ã— time interaction effect was present when evaluating circumplex excited: P = 0.001 (Î·2 = 0.21). Additionally, an interaction effect of meditation and emotional regulation was observed (P = 0.009) among those with varying degrees of meditation experience. A 10-min bout of brisk walking and meditation, prior to exposure to a negative emotion cue, did not differentially effect the ability to regulate sadness, anger, or anxiousness when compared to an active stretching control group. Future replicative work addressing this paradigm, which is in support of positive psychology theory, is warranted.

1982,"Comparison of the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral based and mindfulness-based stress management program on activity, quality of life and self-efficiency of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus","Background and Objective: Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease and its prevalence in Iran is estimated to be 40 in 100,000 people. The psychological manifestations are common in patients with clinical manifestations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of MBRI and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) on disease activity, quality of life and self-efficiency among these patients. Materials and Methods: In this semi-experimental study, via a pre-test and post-test, 45 patients with lupus in Shahrekord were selected by available sampling method based on American College of Rheumatology criteria and were randomly divided into two experimental and one control groups. Three groups underwent the common medical care. The first group received 8 sessions of MBSR and the second group received 8 sessions of CBT. In the pre-test, post-test and 3-month follow-up, the SF36 quality of life questionnaire, Shererâ€™s self-efficiency and lupus disease activity index were completed. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software and descriptive and inferential statistics (variance analysis with repeated measures) were similarly carried out. Results: The mean scores of disease activity in different stages of the study did not differ significantly (P <0.05). The mean scores of the quality of life in both methods of treatment in the post-test and follow up stage significantly increased compared to the control group and the mean scores of the MBSR group were higher than the CBT group in the post-test and follow-up stages. The mean scores of self-efficiency of patients in both treatment methods showed a significant increase in the post-test and follow-up stages and their effect was similar. Conclusion: Although the psychological interventions did not have much effect on the lupus disease activity, the CBT interventions, especially MBSR, led to a steady improvement in the quality of life and self-efficiency of the patients.

1983,Aerobic Exercise Reduces Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Evidence suggests aerobic exercise has anxiolytic effects; yet, the treatment potential for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and responsible anxiolytic mechanisms have received little attention. Emerging evidence indicates that attentional focus during exercise may dictate the extent of therapeutic benefit. Whether benefits are a function of attentional focus toward or away from somatic arousal during exercise remains untested. Thirty-three PTSD-affected participants completed two weeks of stationary biking aerobic exercise (six sessions). To assess the effect of attentional focus, participants were randomized into three exercise groups: group 1 (attention to somatic arousal) received prompts directing their attention to the interoceptive effects of exercise, group 2 (distraction from somatic arousal) watched a nature documentary, and group 3 exercised with no distractions or interoceptive prompts. Hierarchal linear modeling showed all groups reported reduced PTSD and anxiety sensitivity (AS; i.e., fear of arousal-related somatic sensations) during treatment. Interaction effects between group and time were found for PTSD hyperarousal and AS physical and social scores, wherein group 1, receiving interoceptive prompts, experienced significantly less symptom reduction than other groups. Most participants (89%) reported clinically significant reductions in PTSD severity after the two-week intervention. Findings suggest, regardless of attentional focus, aerobic exercise reduces PTSD symptoms.

1984,A randomized controlled pilot trial of acceptance and commitment training (ACT) for preventing stress-related ill health among future nurses,"Background: Levels of stress and burnout increase during nursing education. This development has consequences for nursing students' health, learning, competence, and interest in quality issues in health care. Design: In a randomized controlled pilot trial with a sample of 113 nursing students the effect of an intervention using techniques from acceptance and commitment training (ACT) to prevent the development of stress and burnout was evaluated. Method: The 6 Ã— 2-hour program was compared to standard treatment (reflection seminars) post-intervention and at a three-month follow-up using longitudinal analysis of mean response profiles. Mechanisms of change were investigated using a baseline-post intervention two-mediator model. Results: The intervention resulted in increased mindful awareness and decreased experiential avoidance, as well as decreased perceived stress and burnout. Levels of mindful awareness and perceived stress were sustained at follow-up. The proposed mechanisms of change were partly supported by the data. Conclusion: This study shows that techniques from ACT might have the potential to contribute to preventing the development of stress and burnout during nursing education. However, additional studies are needed to validate these results. Â© 2015 Taylor & Francis.","FrÃ¶gÃ©li E., Djordjevic A., Rudman A., Livheim F., Gustavsson P.",0,10.1080/10615806.2015.1025765,1514

1986,Mindfulness-oriented recovery enhancement reduces pain attentional bias in chronic pain patients,"Background: Chronic pain involves hypervigilance for pain-related stimuli. Selective attention to pain-related stimuli, known as pain attentional bias (AB), can exacerbate chronic pain, prolong suffering, and undermine quality of life. The aim of this study was to determine if a multimodal mindfulness-oriented intervention could significantly reduce pain AB among chronic pain patients receiving opioid analgesics. Methods: A total of 67 chronic pain patients were randomized to an 8-week Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) intervention or a social support group intervention and began treatment. A dot probe task was used to measure pain AB. Primary outcomes were pain AB scores for cues presented for 2,000 and 200 ms. Results: Prior to intervention, participants exhibited a significant bias towards pain-related cues presented for 2,000 ms, but no bias for cues presented for 200 ms. A statistically significant time Ã— intervention condition interaction was observed for 2,000 ms pain AB, such that participants in MORE evidenced significantly reduced posttreatment pain AB relative to pretreatment levels, whereas no significant pre-post treatment changes in pain AB were observed for support group participants. Decreases in pain AB were associated with increased perceived control over pain and attenuated reactivity to distressing thoughts and emotions. Conclusion: Study findings provide the first indication that a mindfulness-oriented intervention may reduce pain AB among adults suffering from chronic pain. Given the magnitude of chronic pain in postindustrial societies, coupled with the dramatic escalation in prescription opioid misuse, future studies should evaluate MORE as a nonpharmacological means of addressing factors linked with chronic pain.

1987,Challenges and Innovations in a Community-Based Participatory Randomized Controlled Trial,"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are a long-standing and important design for conducting rigorous tests of the effectiveness of health interventions. However, many questions have been raised about the external validity of RCTs, their utility in explicating mechanisms of intervention and participants' intervention experiences, and their feasibility and acceptability. In the current mixed-methods study, academic and community partners developed and implemented an RCT to test the effectiveness of a collaboratively developed community-based advocacy, learning, and social support intervention. The goals of the intervention were to address social determinants of health and build trust and connections with other mental health services in order to reduce mental health disparities among Afghan, Great Lakes Region African, and Iraqi refugee adults and to engage and retain refugees in trauma-focused treatment, if needed. Two cohorts completed the intervention between 2013 and 2015. Ninety-three adult refugees were randomly assigned to intervention or control group and completed four research interviews (pre-, mid-, and postintervention, and follow-up). Several challenges to conducting a community-based RCT emerged, including issues related to interviewer intervention to assist participants in the control group, diffusion of intervention resources throughout the small refugee communities, and staff and community concerns about the RCT design and what evidence is meaningful to demonstrate intervention effectiveness. These findings highlight important epistemological, methodological, and ethical challenges that should be considered when conducting community-based RCTs and interpreting results from them. In addition, several innovations were developed to address these challenges, which may be useful for other community-academic partnerships engaged in RCTs.","Goodkind, Jessica R.; Amer, Suha; Christian, Charlisa; Hess, Julia Meredith; Bybee, Deborah; Isakson, Brian L.; Baca, Brandon; Ndayisenga, Martin; Greene, R.

1989,A randomized controlled trial of an Internet-based cognitive-behavioural skills package for carers of people with anorexia nervosa,"Background. Anorexia nervosa (AN) poses a major burden on families. Carers (e.g. parents or partners) of people with AN are often highly distressed and may inadvertently respond in ways that can contribute to the maintenance of the disorder, e. g. through high levels of over-involvement and criticism [also known as expressed emotion (EE)]. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel web-based systemic cognitive-behavioural (CBT) intervention for carers of people with AN, designed to reduce carer distress and teach skills in how to offer effective support.Method. Carers of people with AN (n=64) were randomly allocated to either the web-intervention, overcoming anorexia online, with limited clinician supportive guidance (by email or phone), or to ad-hoc usual support from the UK patient and carer organization Beat. Carer outcomes were assessed at post-treatment (4 months) and follow-up (6 months).Results. Compared with the control intervention, web-based treatment significantly reduced carers' anxiety and depression (primary outcome) at post-treatment, with a similar trend in carers' EE. Other secondary outcomes did not favour the online intervention. Gains were maintained at follow-up.Conclusions. This is the first ever study to use an online CBT program to successfully reduce carer distress and improve carers' ability to support the person with AN.","Grover, M.; Naumann, U.; Mohammad-Dar, L.; Glennon, D.; Ringwood, S.; Eisler, I.; Williams, C.; Treasure, J.; Schmidt, U.",0,10.1017/S0033291711000766,1518

Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted at 2 automotive assembly plants in Malaysia over 9 months, from January 2012 to September 2012. Assembly-line workers from Plant A received DBE training while Plant B acted as a control by receiving pamphlets on stress and its ill-effects. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted among the self-voluntary respondents in Plant A (n=468) and Plant B (n=293). The level of stress was measured using Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) stress subscale. Results: Significant favorable intervention effects were found in Plant A (Effect size=0.6) as compared to Plant B (Effect size=0.2) at the end of the study in those receiving DBE. Time and group interaction effects were examined using the repeated measure ANOVA test in which there was a significant group *time interaction effect [F (1, 1) = 272.45, P<0.001]. Conclusion: The improvement in stress levels showed the potential of DBE training as part of Employee Assistance Program in the automotive assembly plant. Future studies should be carried out to assess the long term effects of an on-site relaxation training to provide stronger evidence for the introduction of DBE among assembly-line workers as a coping strategy to alleviate occupational stress.","Sundram, BM; Dahlui, M; Chinna, K",1,,1519
1991,The Psychological and Physiological Effects of Using a Therapy Dog in Mindfulness Training,"The present study was a randomized controlled trial examining the psychological and physiological effects of adding animal-assisted therapy (AAT) to a modified Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program (MBSR) for clients experiencing psychological distress. It was hypothesized that AAT would complement mindfulness-based interventions because the therapy dog will provide a focus for attention to the current experience and exemplify acceptance and ""being,"" enabling the understanding and practice of the main aspects of mindfulness. Participants (n = 21) were randomly assigned to an MBSR or MBSR + AAT group and then completed an intervention consisting of six 50-minute individual therapy sessions. Each session included didactic and experiential components modified for delivery with or without a certified therapy dog. State and trait mindfulness, psychological distress measures, blood pressure, and heart rate were assessed at each session. Results indicate that all participants experienced fewer anxiety and depressive symptoms, decreased psychological distress, and increased mindfulness skills from pre- to post-treatment. Additionally, state anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rate decreased within sessions. No significant difference was found between the control and experimental groups, indicating that interaction with a therapy dog had no impact on symptom reduction, skill acquisition, or client satisfaction in the current study. However, moderate to large effect size estimates indicate clinically significant differences between groups, with higher ratings for the MBSR + AAT group on therapist efficacy, recommending the training, and participating in future treatment. Future studies need to increase methodological rigor by including multiple therapist/dog teams and increasing sample size. Moreover, researchers must more thoroughly examine the role the dog might have in altering the social environment, such as reducing stigma surrounding mental health services and enhancing the therapeutic alliance.","Henry, Courtney L.; Crowley, Susan L.",0,10.1080/08927936.2015.1052272,1520
1992,Test of a web-based program to improve adherence to HIV medications,"We evaluated the effectiveness of a web-based version of the Life-Steps intervention combined with modules for stress reduction and mood management, designed to improve medication adherence among HIV infected individuals. 168 HIV+ adults were randomized into either the Life-Steps program or a waitlist control condition. All participants completed a baseline assessment and provided a 2-week electronic pill (MEMS) cap baseline reading. Follow up data collection was conducted at 3, 6 and 9 months. Patients in the web-based Life-Steps condition had significantly higher antiretroviral medication adherence rates than patients in the control group over the nine-month period as measured by the MEMS cap. In addition, analysis of viral load data indicated that the program also resulted in a significant decrease in viral load. These findings indicate that a web-based Life-Steps program can be a useful and implementable tool for helping patients living with HIV maintain medication adherence.

1993,Evaluating an online stress management intervention for college students,"The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a theory-based online intervention designed to improve stress management in undergraduate students. The intervention focused on present control because it has been found to be associated with a range of positive outcomes, including lower levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, controlling for a range of other variables (e.g., Frazier et al., 2011, 2012). Two pilot studies were first conducted to confirm that our intervention could increase present control. We then randomly assigned psychology students (n = 292) who were prescreened to have lower scores on the present control subscale of the Perceived Control Over Stressful Events Scale (Frazier et al., 2011) to 1 of 3 conditions: the present control intervention, the present control intervention plus feedback, and stress-information only. Seventy-six percent (n = 223) began the intervention, and 87% (n = 195) of those completed the posttest and 3-week follow-up. The 2 present control intervention groups had lower levels of stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms (on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales; Lovibond&Lovibond, 1995) and perceived stress (on the Perceived Stress Scale Cohen, Kamarck,&Mermelstein, 1983) relative to the stress-information-only group at posttest and 3-week follow-up (mean between group d at follow-up =.35, mean within group d for intervention groups at follow-up = -.46). Further, mediation analyses revealed that these effects were mediated by changes in present control. Our intervention represents a potentially valuable tool for college mental health services.

1994,Parenting stress in families with very low birth weight preterm infants in early infancy,"Taking care of a premature infant adds an extra burden to already stressed parents. Previous studies have shown that parental stress occurs during the initial hospitalization. However, there is little information on parental stress over time, and the few existing results are conflicting. In addition, many studies have focused on maternal stress but there is little information about a father's long-term adaptation to stress. The purpose of this study was to examine the degree and type of parenting stress in the families of very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm infants over the first two years of life. We compared parenting stress in families with preterm infants with control families, while also comparing the stress in mothers to that in fathers. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between parenting stress in the preterm group with identified factors that included the infant's age, medical complications, and parents' perceived feeding issues after they had been discharged from the hospital. This was an exploratory study with a cross sectional design. Participants included a total of 505 mothers from Tainan, Taiwan; 297 with preterm children (239 mothers, 58 fathers) and 208 with full-term children (181 mothers, 27 fathers). Assessments including the Parenting Stress Index, Neonatal Medical Index and Behavior-based Feeding Questionnaire were used to measure parental distress, infants' medical complications and parents' perceived feeding issues, respectively. Results of the study, though not statistically significant, indicated the presence of increased parenting stress in parents of preterm infants as compared to parents of full-term infants. 13.1% of mothers with preterm infants demonstrated total stress levels that warranted clinical intervention. We also found that mothers of preterm infants presented different parenting stress patterns than fathers of preterm infants. Fathers of preterm infants tended to have overall higher stress scores than mothers. On the other hand, mothers of preterm infants tended to report more health related difficulties, more depression, higher social isolation and role restriction, and less support from their spouses, than reported by fathers. Moreover, as time went on, parents with preterm infants continued to experience greater parenting stress than those with full-term infants. Understanding the experiences of parents with preterm children is important for health care providers while interviewing parents for information regarding their children and designing intervention programs to improve children's outcomes.

1995,The association of sleep disturbances with endocrine and perceived stress reactivity measures in male employees,"Evidence on the relationship between stress reactivity and sleep is conflicting. This study examined the association between disturbed sleep and perceived and endocrine stress reactivity independently of age, body mass index (BMI), and chronic stress. One hundred and twenty middle-aged men were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test for Groups. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Perceived Stress Reactivity Scale were used to assess sleep and perceived stress reactivity, respectively. Endocrine stress reactivity was examined by assessing salivary cortisol levels. Regression analyses showed that men with disturbed sleep had blunted overall cortisol responses (bÂ =Â âˆ’18.246, pÂ =.044), but the association did not survive adjustment for age, BMI, and chronic stress. In contrast, poor sleep was associated with heightened perceived stress reactivity independently of age and BMI (bÂ =Â 0.235, pÂ =.005), but additional adjustment for chronic stress attenuated the relationship and only chronic stress remained a significant predictor of perceived stress reactivity (bÂ =Â 0.470, pÂ <.001). Cortisol and perceived stress reactivity were uncorrelated. In summary, our study indicates associations between sleep disturbances and stress reactivity were not independent of BMI and chronic stress levels, and endocrine and perceived stress reactivity were dissociated.

1996,A Randomized Effectiveness Study Comparing Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy With Therapy as Usual for Youth,"The efficacy of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) has been shown in several randomized controlled trials. However, few trials have been conducted in community clinics, few have used therapy as usual (TAU) as a comparison group, and none have been conducted outside of the United States. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of TF-CBT in regular community settings compared with TAU. One hundred fifty-six traumatized youth (M age = 15.1 years, range = 10-18; 79.5% girls) were randomly assigned to TF-CBT or TAU. Intent-to-treat analysis using mixed effects models showed that youth receiving TF-CBT reported significantly lower levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms (est. = 5.78, d = 0.51), 95% CI [2.32, 9.23]; depression (est. = 7.00, d = 0.54), 95% CI [2.04, 11.96]; and general mental health symptoms (est. = 2.54, d = 0.45), 95% CI [0.50, 4.58], compared with youth in the TAU group. Youth assigned to TF-CBT showed significantly greater improvements in functional impairment (est. = -1.05, d = -0.55), 95% CI [-1.67, -0.42]. Although the same trend was found for anxiety reduction, this difference was not statistically significant (est. = 4.34, d = 0.30), 95% CI [-1.50, 10.19]. Significantly fewer youths in the TF-CBT condition were diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder compared to youths in the TAU condition, Ï‡2(1, N = 116) = 4.61, p =.031, Phi =.20). Findings indicate that TF-CBT is effective in treating traumatized youth in community mental health clinics and that the program may also be successfully implemented in countries outside the United States.

1998,Commitment to a purpose in life: An antidote to the suffering by individuals with social anxiety disorder,"Recent acceptance- and mindfulness-based cognitive- behavioral interventions explicitly target the clarification and commitment to a purpose in life. Yet, scant empirical evidence exists on the value of purpose as a mechanism relevant to psychopathology or well-being. The present research explored daily (within-person) fluctuations in purposeful pursuits and well-being in a community sample of 84 adults with (n = 41) and without (n = 43) the generalized subtype of social anxiety disorder (SAD). After completing an idiographic measure of purpose in life, participants monitored their effort and progress toward this purpose, along with their well-being each day. Across 2 weeks of daily reports, we found that healthy controls reported increased self-esteem, meaning in life, positive emotions, and decreased negative emotions. People with SAD experienced substantial boosts in well-being indicators on days characterized by significant effort or progress toward their life purpose. We found no evidence for the reverse direction (with well-being boosting the amount of effort or progress that people with SAD devote to their purpose), and effects could not be attributed to comorbid mood or anxiety disorders. Results provide evidence for how commitment to a purpose in life enriches the daily existence of people with SAD. The current study supports principles that underlie what many clinicians are already doing with clients for SAD.

1999,Effects of the job stress education for supervisors on psychological distress and job performance among their immediate subordinates: A supervisor-based randomized controlled trial,"As job stress is now one of the biggest health-related problems in the workplace, several education programs for supervisors have been conducted to reduce job stress. We conducted a supervisor-based randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of an education program on their subordinates' psychological distress and job performance. The subjects were 301 employees (46 supervisors and 255 subordinates) in a Japanese sake brewery. First, we randomly allocated supervisors to the education group (24 supervisors) and the waiting-list group (22 supervisors). Then, for the allocated supervisors we introduced a single-session, 60-min education program according to the guidelines for employee mental health promotion along with training that provided consulting skills combined with role-playing exercises. We conducted pre- and post-intervention (after 3 months) surveys for all subordinates to examine psychological distress and job performance. We defined the intervention group as those subordinates whose immediate supervisors received the education, and the control group was defined as those subordinates whose supervisors did not. To evaluate the effects, we employed a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Overall, the intervention effects (time x group) were not significant for psychological distress or job performance among both male (p=0.456 and 0.252) and female (p=0.714 and 0.106) subordinates. However, young male subordinates engaged in white-collar occupations showed significant intervention effects for psychological distress (p=0.012) and job performance (p=0.029). In conclusion, our study indicated a possible beneficial effect of supervisor education on the psychological distress and job performance of subordinates. This effect may vary according to specific groups.","Takao, Soshi; Tsutsumi, Akizumi; Nishiuchi, Kyoko; Mineyama, Sachiko; Kawakami, Norito",1,10.1539/joh.48.494,1528

Purpose: We tested how sequential versus simultaneous diet plus PA interventions affected behavior changes. Methods: Two hundred participants over age 44 years not meeting national PA and dietary recommendations (daily fruit and vegetable servings and percent of calories from saturated fat) were randomized to one of four 12-month telephone interventions: sequential (exercise first or diet first), simultaneous, or attention control. At 4 months, the other health behavior was added in the sequential arms. Results: Ninety-three percent of participants were retained through 12 months. At 4 months, only exercise first improved PA, and only the simultaneous and diet-first interventions improved dietary variables. At 12 months, mean levels of all behaviors in the simultaneous arm met recommendations, though not in the exercise- and diet-first arms. Conclusions: We observed a possible behavioral suppression effect of early dietary intervention on PA that merits investigation.

2001,Tai Chi workplace program for improving musculoskeletal fitness among female computer users,"Background: Workplace computer use has increased dramatically in recent years and has been linked to musculoskeletal disorders, a leading cause of work disability and productivity losses in industrialized nations. Tai Chi is a simple, convenient workplace intervention that may promote musculoskeletal health without special equipment or showering, yet no study has investigated Tai Chi as a workplace physical exercise for health promotion.Objective: To examine the effects of a workplace Tai Chi (TC) intervention on musculoskeletal fitness and psychological well-being among female university employees who are computer users.Methods: The exercise program consisted of two 50 minute TC classes per week for 12 consecutive weeks during the months of May-August 2007. Fifty-two participants were enrolled in a class conducted on campus by a professional TC practitioner during the lunch hour. Socio-demographic characteristics, including information on age, marital status, ethnicity, job category and perceived overall health were collected from all participants. Fitness testing conducted by qualified personnel was assessed pre- and post-program. The tests included resting heart rate, resting blood pressure, anthropometric measures, musculoskeletal fitness and back fitness. Psychological well-being was assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale pre-and post-program.Results: There were significant positive results in several areas including resting heart rate, waist circumference and hand grip strength. Results showed that the TC program was effective in improving musculoskeletal fitness and psychological well-being.Conclusions: Significant improvements in physiological and psychological measures were observed, even at the large class sizes tested here, suggesting that TC has considerable potential as an economic, effective and convenient workplace intervention.","Tamim, Hala; Castel, Evan S.; Jamnik, Veronica; Keir, Peter J.; Grace, Sherry L.; Gledhill, Norman; Macpherson, Alison K.",1,10.3233/WOR-2009-0931,1530
2002,The effectiveness of a self-management occupational therapy intervention on activity performance in individuals with multiple sclerosis-related fatigue: a randomized-controlled trial,"Purpose to evaluate the effectiveness of an individual self-management occupational therapy intervention program (SMOoTh) versus relaxation on the performance of and satisfaction with relevant daily activities in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related fatigue. in a single-blind randomized-controlled trial, 31 patients with MS (SMOoTh: n=17, relaxation: n=14) were randomly allocated to three individual sessions focusing on pacing, prioritizing, ergonomics, and self-management (SMOoTh) or on stress management and relaxation (relaxation). Outcomes (blind assessor): Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) (primary), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Checklist Individual Strength and Short-Form Health Measure. COPM improved in the SMOoTh and relaxation group after the intervention and 3 months later (COPM performance: F=13.1, P=0.001 and COPM satisfaction: F=10.4, P=0.001); nonsignificant group differences showed a trend in favor of SMOoTh. Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Checklist Individual Strength, and most of the Short-Form Health Measure subscales did not change. Clinically relevant changes in COPM performance scores were found in 71 and 27% of patients in the SMOoTh versus the relaxation group. Both interventions seem to be feasible approaches to improve performance of and satisfaction with relevant daily activities in people with MS, with a sustained effect after 3 months. Neither program altered change fatigue (impact) or quality of life. Future studies with larger sample sizes are needed. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

2003,Coping with stress in medical students: results of a randomized controlled trial using a mindfulness-based stress prevention training (MediMind) in Germany,"Background: High prevalence rates of psychological distress in medical training and later professional life indicate a need for prevention. Different types of intervention were shown to have good effects, but little is known about the relative efficacy of different types of stress management interventions, and methodological limitations have been reported. In order to overcome some of these limitations, the present study aimed at evaluating the effect of a specifically developed mindfulness-based stress prevention training for medical students (MediMind) on measures of distress, coping and psychological morbidity.Methods: We report on a prospective randomized controlled trial with three study conditions: experimental treatment (MediMind), standard treatment (Autogenic Training) and a control group without treatment. The sample consisted of medical or dental students in the second or eighth semester. They completed self-report questionnaires at baseline, after the training and at one year follow-up. Distress (Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress, TICS) was assessed as the primary outcome and coping (Brief COPE) as a co-primary outcome. Effects on the psychological morbidity (Brief Symptom Inventory, BSI) as a secondary outcome were expected one year after the trainings.Results: Initially, N = 183 students were randomly allocated to the study groups. At one year follow-up N = 80 could be included into the per-protocol analysis: MediMind (n = 31), Autogenic Training (n = 32) and control group (n = 17). A selective drop-out for students who suffered more often from psychological symptoms was detected (p =.020). MANCOVA's on TICS and Brief COPE revealed no significant interaction effects. On the BSI, a significant overall interaction effect became apparent (p =.002, eta 2partial =.382), but post hoc analyses were not significant. Means of the Global Severity Index (BSI) indicated that MediMind may contribute to a decrease in psychological morbidity.Conclusion: Due to the high and selective dropout rates, the results cannot be generalized and further research is necessary. Since the participation rate of the trainings was high, a need for further prevention programs is indicated. The study gives important suggestions on further implementation and evaluation of stress prevention in medical schools.","Kuhlmann, S.

The control group (n = 37) proceeded with self-study. Participants' stress levels were assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. Feasibility was determined as the percentage of participants completing and attending the programme. Effectiveness was measured as the significant difference in changes in stress levels before and after the intervention between the two groups. Results preliminarily supported that the programme was feasible for JSSS. Completion rate was 100%, and attendance rate was 90%. However, no significant difference was noted in changes in stress levels before and after the intervention between the two groups. The potential health benefits of Tai Chi could not be detected owing to the restrictions imposed by the research setting and study limitations.

2008,Changes in cognitive coping skills and social support during cognitive behavioral stress management intervention and distress outcomes in symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive gay men,"Objective: We have previously reported decreases in dysphoria, anxiety, and total mood disturbance in symptomatic HIV seropositive gay men after a 10-week cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) group intervention. This structured intervention was designed a) to increase cognitive and behavioral coping skills related to managing the distress of symptomatic HIV, and b) to increase social support among group members. Here we examine the relative contribution of changes in coping skills and social support during the intervention period to reductions in dysphoria, anxiety, and distress- related symptoms in this sample. Methods: Participants were randomized to a 10-week CBSM group intervention or to a wait-list control condition. Coping, social supports, and mood were measured before and after the intervention period. Results: Members of the CBSM group (N = 22) showed significant improvement in cognitive coping strategies involving positive reframing and acceptance, and in social supports involving attachment, alliances, and guidance at the end of the 10-week CBSM program compared with controls (N = 18) who showed decrements in these coping abilities and no changes in social support. Improved cognitive coping, specifically acceptance of the HIV infection, was strongly related to lower dysphoria, anxiety, and total mood disturbance in both conditions. Changes in social support and in cognitive coping skills seem to mediate the effects of the experimental condition on the changes in distress noted during the intervention. Conclusions: These results suggest that cognitive coping and social support factors can be modified by psychosocial interventions and may be important determinants of the changes in psychological well-being and quality of life during symptomatic HIV infection that can be achieved through this form of intervention.","Lutgendorf S.K., Antoni M.H., Ironson G., Starr K., Costello N., Zuckerman M., Klimas N., Fletcher M.A., Schneiderman N.",0,10.1097/00006842-199803000-00017,1536

2011,Life transitions and smoking among Asian Americans,"Smoking is a preventable behavior that contributes to substantial loss of life and productivity. Although a growing amount of literature examines smoking among Asian American adolescents, there is a paucity of research investigating experiences that may contribute to smoking among Asian American adults. The purpose of this study is to investigate the links between life transitions and current smoking status among Asian American adults. A sample of Asian Americans was drawn from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) data set collected in 2001-2002 (Grant &Dawson, 2006). Results from logistic regressions indicate that after controlling for sex, age, income, proportion of life in the U.S., and ethnicity, life transitions in the past 12 months (i.e., interpersonal difficulties, death or illness of important other, divorce or separation, unemployment and occupational transitions) were found to be associated with increased odds of current smoking. Culturally specific prevention that centers around coping with stressful life transitions may help reduce smoking and its long-term consequences.

2012,Examining Ways That a Mindfulness-Based Intervention Reduces Stress in Public School Teachers: a Mixed-Methods Study,"Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can reduce teachersâ€™ stress. The purpose of this mixed-method study, conducted within the context of a randomized-control trial of an MBI for teachers, was to examine four potential ways by which the MBI reduced teacher stress, including by (1) increasing their efficacy for regulating emotion on the job; (2) improving their ways of coping with stress at work; (3) increasing their efficacy for forgiving colleagues and students at work following conflict, as well as the tendency to do so; and (4) increasing teachersâ€™ tendency to feel compassion for people generally, and for challenging students in particular. Public school teachers (n = 59) were randomized to an MBI or a waitlist control condition. They completed surveys at pre/post/follow-up and interviews at post-program designed to assess their coping with work stressors and their appraisals of their most challenging students. Survey data showed that efficacy beliefs and the tendency to forgive changed from pre/post for teachers in the MBI, and partially mediated reductions in stress from baseline to 4-month follow-up.

2013,Effects of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and positive psychological intervention (PPI) on female offenders with psychological distress in Hong Kong,"Background: Despite rapid growth in the female prison population, there is little research on effectiveness of psychological interventions for them. Aims: To test the hypotheses that (1) each of two psychological interventions administered separately â€“ cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or positive psychology intervention (PPI) â€“ would be more effective than â€˜treatment-as-usualâ€™ alone in reducing psychological distress and enhancing psychological well-being; (2) outcomes would differ according to intervention; and (3) combining the interventions would be more effective than delivering either alone. Methods: We recruited 40 women in a special Hong Kong prison unit for female offenders with psychological distress. Half of them received eight sessions of CBT followed by eight sessions of PPI; the other half received the same interventions in the reverse order. We recruited another 35 women who received only â€˜treatment as usualâ€™ (TAU) in the same unit. We used various clinical scales to assess the women's psychological distress or well-being before and after the interventions or at similar time points for the comparison women. Results: All intervention group women showed a significant reduction in psychological distress and enhancement in psychological well-being after each intervention alone compared to the TAU women. There were no significant differences between CBT and PPI in this respect. Receiving both treatments, however, did yield significantly more improvement than either intervention alone in reducing depressive thoughts and enhancing global judgement of life satisfaction, self-perceived strengths and hopeful thinking style. Conclusions and implication for practice: Our findings provide preliminary empirical support for the effectiveness of psychological interventions with psychologically distressed women in prison. It would be important now to conduct a full, randomised trial to determine optimal length and combinations of treatment. Copyright Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

2014,Using CALMERSS to Enhance Teacher Well-being: A Pilot Study,"Prior research has shown that cognitive behavioural therapy, relaxation, mindfulness, exercise and positive psychology interventions, when conducted as single interventions, have a useful effect on depression and also increasing well-being. The purpose of this study was to conduct a pilot programme to determine the efficacy of a multi-modal approach to enhancing well-being. Five teachers engaged in the four-week pilot programme called CALMERSS. The findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of the CALMERSS programme in enhancing well-being in participants, through significant reductions in psychological strain, physical and personal strain, and improving self-care. Four of the five participants who would officially have been classified as depressed at the commencement of the programme were no longer depressed at the end of the programme.

2015,Do life-events that obese inpatients think happened to them soon before their subjective problematic weight gain have an effect on their current psychopathology over and beyond BMI and binge eating?,"The present study had two aims: (1) to investigate life-events that obese inpatients think happened to them during the 6 months preceding their subjective problematic weight gain and (2) to evaluate the associations of such life-events with psychopathology controlling for the effects of gender, age, BMI and binge eating in a large sample of obese inpatients referred to hospital for weight-loss treatment. The analysis used cross-sectional data on 2,900 obese adults from the hospital database. Psychopathology was assessed with the SCL-90 questionnaire, binge eating was evaluated with the Bulimic Investigatory Test, Edinburgh (BITE) and life-events were retrospectively assessed with a pre-defined self-report checklist asking patients to select the events that occurred to them in the 6 months preceding their problematic weight gain. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to test the association between a pre-defined classification of patients according to the kind of life-events (""no event"", ""undefined events"", ""negative events"" and ""mixed events"") with psychopathology controlling for gender, age, BMI and binge eating. The life-events factor was significantly associated with psychopathology even after adjusting for the effects of gender, age, BMI and binge eating. A significant linear trend was evident so that obese patients who reported both negative and undefined events or only negative events had higher levels of psychopathology than patients reporting only undefined events or no event. Though these findings should be considered with caution due to the subjective recall of problematic weight gain and the retrospective assessment of life-events, future studies investigating the link between obesity and psychopathology should not ignore the role of negative life-events that obese patients think happened to them before weight gain.

2016,Combining walking and relaxation for stress reductionâ€”A randomized cross-over trial in healthy adults,"Both physical activity and relaxation have stress-relieving potential. This study investigates their combined impact on the relaxation response while considering participants' initial stress level. In a randomized cross-over trial, 81 healthy adults completed 4 types of short-term interventions for stress reduction, each lasting for 1Â hr: (1) physical activity (walking) combined with resting, (2) walking combined with balneotherapy, (3) combined resting and balneotherapy, and (4) resting only. Saliva cortisol, blood pressure, state of mood, and relaxation were measured preintervention and postintervention. Stress levels were determined by validated questionnaires. All interventions were associated with relaxation responses in the variables saliva cortisol, blood pressure, state of mood, and subjective relaxation. No significant differences were found regarding the reduction of salivary cortisol (FÂ =Â 1.30; pÂ =.281). The systolic blood pressure was reduced best when walking was combined with balneotherapy or resting (FÂ =Â 7.34; pÂ <.001). Participants with high stress levels (nÂ =Â 25) felt more alert after interventions including balneotherapy, whereas they reported an increase of tiredness when walking was combined with resting (FÂ =Â 3.20; pÂ =.044). Results suggest that combining physical activity and relaxation (resting or balneotherapy) is an advantageous short-term strategy for stress reduction as systolic blood pressure is reduced best while similar levels of relaxation can be obtained.

2017,The Effects of a Hatha Yoga Intervention on Facets of Distress Tolerance,"Individuals with low distress tolerance (DT) experience negative emotion as particularly threatening and are highly motivated to reduce or avoid such affective experiences. Consequently, these individuals have difficulty regulating emotions and tend to engage in maladaptive strategies, such as overeating, as a means to reduce or avoid distress. Hatha yoga encourages one to implement present-centered awareness and non-reaction in the face of physical and psychological discomfort and, thus, emerges as a potential strategy for increasing DT. To test whether a hatha yoga intervention can enhance DT, a transdiagnostic risk and maintenance factor, this study randomly assigned females high in emotional eating in response to stress (NÂ =Â 52) either to an 8-week, twice-weekly hatha (Bikram) yoga intervention or to a waitlist control condition. Self-reported DT and emotional eating were measured at baseline, weekly during treatment, and 1-week post-treatment. Consistent with prediction, participants in the yoga condition reported greater increases in DT over the course of the intervention relative to waitlist participants (Cohen's dÂ =Â .82). Also consistent with prediction, the reduction in emotional eating was greater for the yoga condition than the waitlist condition (Cohen's dÂ =Â .92). Importantly, reductions distress absorption, a specific sub-facet of DT, accounted for 15% of the variance in emotional eating, a hallmark behavior of eating pathology and risk factor for obesity.

2018,Day treatment of patients with severe work-related complaints,"A day treatment program was developed for patients suffering with severe workrelated complaints who were unable to function at work because of this. The program consisted of a number of treatment modalities, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, protocolized nonverbal therapies, and activation. The main objective of all these therapies was to analyze participants' personal qualities and vulnerabilities when functioning at work and to teach them new coping strategies and social skills to reduce their vulnerability in stressful situations. The results of the program were assessed in terms of scores on a number of self-rating questionnaires and hours spent at work. In a follow-up assessment one year after the original program had finished, we found a significant reduction in complaints and an increase in the number of hours spent on the job. At the start of the program, patients worked 25.2% of their contracted hours; a year later, this had increased to 77.3%. Even though this natural field study has its limitations, the results of the day treatment program seem very promising.

2019,Impact of Booster Breaks and Computer Prompts on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Among Desk-Based Workers: A Cluster-Randomized Controlled Trial,"IntroductionThe 15-minute work break provides an opportunity to promote health, yet few studies have examined this part of the workday. We studied physical activity and sedentary behavior among office workers and compared the results of the Booster Break program with those of a second intervention and a control group to determine whether the Booster Break program improved physical and behavioral health outcomes.MethodsWe conducted a 3-arm, cluster-randomized controlled trial at 4 worksites in Texas from 2010 through 2013 to compare a group-based, structured Booster Break program to an individual-based computer-prompt intervention and a usual-break control group; we analyzed physiologic, behavioral, and employee measures such as work social support, quality of life, and perceived stress. We also identified consistent and inconsistent attendees of the Booster Break sessions.ResultsWe obtained data from 175 participants (mean age, 43 y; 67% racial/ethnic minority). Compared with the other groups, the consistent Booster Break attendees had greater weekly pedometer counts (P<.001), significant decreases in sedentary behavior and self-reported leisure-time physical activity (P<.001), and a significant increase in triglyceride concentrations (P=.02) (levels remained within the normal range). Usual-break participants significantly increased their body mass index, whereas Booster Break participants maintained body mass index status during the 6 months. Overall, Booster Break participants were 6.8 and 4.3 times more likely to have decreases in BMI and weekend sedentary time, respectively, than usual-break participants.ConclusionFindings varied among the 3 study groups; however, results indicate the potential for consistent attendees of the Booster Break intervention to achieve significant, positive changes related to physical activity, sedentary behavior, and body mass index.","Taylor, Wendell C.; Paxton, Raheem J.; Shegog, Ross; Coan, Sharon P.; Dubin, Allison; Page, Timothy F.; Rempel, David M.",1,10.5888/pcd13.160231,1547
2020,Can the effectiveness of an online stress management program be augmented by wearable sensor technology?,"Background: Internet interventions for mental health concerns are known to be effective, but how can developing technology be utilised to improve engagement and augment the effectiveness of these programs? One option might be to incorporate feedback about the user's physiological state into the program, via wearable sensors. Objectives: This mixed-methods pilot study sought to examine whether the effectiveness of an online intervention for stress in students could be augmented by the use of prototype wearable sensors. Methods: Students who were stressed, but not depressed, were allocated to a stress management program alone (n = 34), with sensors (n = 29), or to no intervention (n = 35). Interventions lasted 4 weeks. Outcome measures included measures of stress, anxious, and depressive symptoms, and were measured immediately after the interventions and 4 weeks later. Participants in the two program groups were interviewed to gain feedback about the program and the sensors. Results: Significant pre-post reductions in stress (p = .019) were observed for those in the program alone group. Significant reductions in depressive symptoms were observed among postgraduates (p = .006), but not undergraduates, in the program only group. The program plus sensors group had a broadly similar, but weaker set of results, indicating that the sensors impeded, rather than augmented, the effectiveness of the program. Qualitative data explicate this finding, highlighting participation burden as a key issue. Participants provided detailed feedback about the program, the sensors, and biofeedback exercises, which are summarised and discussed with reference to the quantitative findings. Conclusions: The newly developed stress management program could be an effective way to improve student mental health. Wearable sensor technology, particularly biofeedback exercises, may be a useful contribution for the next generation of e-therapies, but further development of the prototypes is needed and their reliability and usability will likely affect user responses to them.

2021,"Impact of peer support on PTSD, Hope, and functional impairment: A mixed-methods study of child soldiers in Nepal","The experience of child soldiers during postwar civilian reintegration is recognized as a major contributor to mental health. For some children, postwar social relations may be more important than war trauma in determining psychosocial well-being. Mixed methods incorporating epidemiology and qualitative case studies were employed to evaluate the effects of family, peer, and community relations after reintegration on psychosocial outcomes: hope, functional impairment, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Participants were 142 child soldiers, including 9 qualitative case studies. Peer support predicted increased hope, decreased functional impairment, and decreased PTSD symptoms. Conversely, problems with peer relations predicted less hope and more PTSD symptoms. Maximizing peer support and minimizing stigma from peers should be prioritized within psychosocial reintegration programs, especially among former child soldiers with PTSD.

2022,The effect of timing and frequency of push notifications on usage of a smartphone-based stress management intervention: An exploratory trial,"Push notifications offer a promising strategy for enhancing engagement with smartphone-based health interventions. Intelligent sensor-driven machine learning models may improve the timeliness of notifications by adapting delivery to a user's current context (e.g. location). This exploratory mixed-methods study examined the potential impact of timing and frequency on notification response and usage of Healthy Mind, a smartphone-based stress management intervention. 77 participants were randomised to use one of three versions of Healthy Mind that provided: intelligent notifications; daily notifications within pre-defined time frames; or occasional notifications within pre-defined time frames. Notification response and Healthy Mind usage were automatically recorded. Telephone interviews explored participants' experiences of using Healthy Mind. Participants in the intelligent and daily conditions viewed (d = .47, .44 respectively) and actioned (d = .50, .43 respectively) more notifications compared to the occasional group. Notification group had no meaningful effects on percentage of notifications viewed or usage of Healthy Mind. No meaningful differences were indicated between the intelligent and non-intelligent groups. Our findings suggest that frequent notifications may encourage greater exposure to intervention content without deterring engagement, but adaptive tailoring of notification timing does not always enhance their use. Hypotheses generated from this study require testing in future work. Trial registration number: ISRCTN67177737 Â© 2017 Morrison et al.

2023,An evaluation of trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy for children in Zambia,"To monitor and evaluate the feasibility of implementing Trauma Focused-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) to address trauma and stress-related symptoms in orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Zambia as part of ongoing programming within a non-governmental organization (NGO). As part of ongoing programming, voluntary care-workers administered locally validated assessments to identify children who met criteria for moderate to severe trauma symptomatology. Local lay counselors implemented TF-CBT with identified families, while participating in ongoing supervision. Fifty-eight children and adolescents aged 5-18 completed the TF-CBT treatment, with pre- and post-assessments. The mean number of traumas reported by the treatment completers (N= 58) was 4.11. Post assessments showed significant reductions in severity of trauma symptoms (p<. 0.0001), and severity of shame symptoms (p<. 0.0001). Our results suggest that TF-CBT is a feasible treatment option in Zambia for OVC. A decrease in symptoms suggests that a controlled trial is warranted. Implementation factors monitored suggest that it is feasible to integrate and evaluate evidence-based mental health assessments and intervention into programmatic services run by an NGO in low/middle resource countries. Results also support the effectiveness of implementation strategies such as task shifting, and the Apprenticeship Model of training and supervision.

2024,Basic science and clinical application of the contrast avoidance model in generalized anxiety disorder,"The Contrast Avoidance model (Newman & Llera, 2011) proposes that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are excessively sensitive to negative emotional shifts (contrasts) in response to unpleasant events, and thus recruit a state of sustained intrapersonal negativity via worry as a defensive stance against such shifting states. Here we review the basic science related to environmental, psychological, and biological risk factors in the development of such emotional sensitivities in GAD, and present evidence supporting the position that worry and maladaptive interpersonal styles are employed as defensive strategies to protect against emotional contrasts. We present 2 case examples to elucidate these issues, as well as to introduce specific clinical recommendations for targeting and treating these behaviors.

2025,The effect of a structured intervention on Caregivers of patients with dementia and problem behaviors - A randomized controlled pilot study,"The objective was to assess the effect of a structured intervention on caregiver stress and the institutionalization rate of patients with dementia and problem behaviors. Caregivers contacting the Federazione Alzheimer Italia (AI) to receive help, advice, or information in relation to problem behaviors of outpatients were enrolled. Eligible caregiver-patient dyads were randomized to receive either a structured intervention or the counseling AI usually provides (control group). After basal assessment, families were reassessed at 6 and 12 months. Problem behavior (particularly agitation) was the only variable significantly correlated (P = 0.006) with the baseline caregivers' stress score. Thirty-nine families completed the 12-month follow-up; the mean problem behavior score was significantly lower in the intervention than the control group (p < 0.03); the time needed for care of the patient increased by 0.5 +/- 9.7 hours/day in the control group and decreased by 0.3 +/- 4.1 in the intervention group (p = 0.4, Wilcoxon test). The main determinant of institutionalization seemed to be the level of caregiver stress (p = 0.03). In patients of the intervention group, there was a significant reduction in the frequency of delusions. This pilot study suggests that caregiver stress is relieved by a structured intervention. The number of families lost to follow-up, the relatively short duration of the study, and the ceiling effect due to the severity of the clinical characteristics of patients probably all partly dilute the observed findings.","Nobili, A; Riva, E; Tettamanti, M; Lucca, U; Liscio, M; Petrucci, B; Porro, GS",0,10.1097/01.wad.0000126618.98867.fc,1553

Methods: A group-based stress management intervention was provided to a sample of self-referred adults. After each therapy session, group members completed a process measure. Before and after the intervention, group members underwent a psychophysiological assessment of negative moods, daily stress, physical symptoms, and cardiovascular reactivity to stress. Results: Group process was comprised of three dimensions: positive process, satisfaction, and negative process. Ratings of positive and satisfaction significantly increased across sessions. In addition, satisfaction ratings were inversely correlated with cardiovascular reactivity, whereas negative process ratings were positively correlated with cardiovascular reactivity. Conclusion: The finding of increasing positive process and satisfaction may be related to the structure of the interventions, which allowed for more frequent and diverse interaction during later sessions. Correlations between negative process and cardiovascular reactivity may reflect the influence of hostile traits.","O'Brien, WH; Korchynsky, R; Fabrizio, J; McGrath, J; Swank, A",0,10.1177/104973159900900506,1554

We assessed whether Time Perspective (TP) is associated with cortisol dynamics among healthy adults (N= 61, Ages = 18-35, M= 22.9, SD = 4.1) exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). TP was measured according to two profiles: maladaptive Deviation from Balanced TP (DBTP) and adaptive Deviation from Negative TP (DNTP). Eight salivary cortisol samples were analyzed using area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) and to increase (AUCi). Statistic analyses involved partial correlations controlling for depressive symptoms. Results for both sexes showed that higher DBTP scores were associated with lower cortisol AUCg scores, while higher DNTP scores were associated with higher cortisol AUCg scores. These novel findings suggest that maladaptive TP profiles influence hypocortisolism, whereas adaptive TP profiles influence hypercortisolism. Thus, TP profiles may impact conditions characterized by altered cortisol concentrations.

2031,"Attribution-based motivation treatment efficacy in high-stress student athletes: A moderated-mediation analysis of cognitive, affective, and achievement processes","Objectives Student athletes encounter significant challenges during school-to-college transitions that can increase stress and undermine academic adjustment (Heelis & Shields, 2015). An attribution-based motivation treatment (Perry et al., 2014) was administered to student athletes who differed in perceived stress to improve short- and long-term academic performance. Methods In a two-semester, quasi-experimental, randomized treatment study, we examined the efficacy of an attribution-based motivation treatment (Attributional Retraining; AR) for competitive student athletes (N = 185) who differed in perceived stress (low, high). A theory-based path analysis assessed whether AR-performance effects were mediated by perceived academic control (PAC) and achievement emotions. Results High-stress student athletes who received AR outperformed their no-treatment counterparts by roughly one letter grade on a Semester 1 post-treatment class test. Consistent with Weiner's attribution theory (1985, 2012) of motivation and emotions, AR-performance effects were mediated by cognitive and affective process variables. For high-stress athletes, AR fostered course-related PAC, which in turn increased positive and reduced negative affect, which in combination promoted final course grades. Conclusions AR effects on performance for high-stress student athletes were indirect via cognitive and affective mediators consistent with Weiner's attribution theory (1985, 2012). Findings suggest attribution-based motivation treatments have practical implications for athletic programs, administrators, coaches, and directors in facilitating adjustment for high-stress student athletes.

2032,Assessing mental imagery in clinical psychology: A review of imagery measures and a guiding framework,"Mental imagery is an under-explored field in clinical psychology research but presents a topic of potential interest and relevance across many clinical disorders, including social phobia, schizophrenia, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. There is currently a lack of a guiding framework from which clinicians may select the domains or associated measures most likely to be of appropriate use in mental imagery research. We adopt an interdisciplinary approach and present a review of studies across experimental psychology and clinical psychology in order to highlight the key domains and measures most likely to be of relevance. This includes a consideration of methods for experimentally assessing the generation, maintenance, inspection and transformation of mental images; as well as subjective measures of characteristics such as image vividness and clarity. We present a guiding framework in which we propose that cognitive, subjective and clinical aspects of imagery should be explored in future research. The guiding framework aims to assist researchers in the selection of measures for assessing those aspects of mental imagery that are of most relevance to clinical psychology. We propose that a greater understanding of the role of mental imagery in clinical disorders will help drive forward advances in both theory and treatment.

2033,The Role of a Multicomponent Home-Health Intervention in Reducing Caregiver Stress in Singapore: A Qualitative Study,"Purpose: The relationship between caregiving and negative health outcomes is well established in the literature. Previous studies have shown that community-based programs reduce caregiver stress. However, the mechanisms by which this happens have not been well investigated. This qualitative study examines caregivers' experiences as a part of the Aging-In-Place intervention, a home-health program in Singapore targeted at frequently hospitalized patients and their caregivers. Method: We interviewed 32 caregivers to study the underlying processes by which caregiver stress was ameliorated. Transcripts from semistructured interviews were analyzed thematically within the theoretical framework of the stress process model. Results: Primary stressors related to routine patient care were reduced through the intervention program that provided health monitoring to patients and facilitated linkages to community-based services. Increased access to advice and medical information provided by intervention staff reduced caregivers' uncertainty, a substantial secondary stressor. Caregivers who employed a foreign domestic worker (FDW) gained additional reductions in both primary and secondary stressors.

FDWs constituted a resource that caregivers could rely on and the training provided to FDWs by intervention staff further reduced caregiver stress.

2034,Cognitive behavioral stress management effects on injury and illness among competitive athletes: A randomized clinical trial,"Cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) has previously been found to reduce fatigue, depression, and cortisol response to heavy exercise training among competitive collegiate athletes and to speed physical and psychological recovery from surgery (1,2). Our study assessed the efficacy of a CBSM program to reduce the frequency of injury and illness among collegiate athletes in a randomized, single-blind, controlled clinical trial. Following assessment of baseline medical history, mood state, stress, cortisol, sleep, alcohol use, and exercise training, collegiate rowers were stratified by gender and competitive level and randomly assigned to either a control group or a CBSM group. Exercise training information andpsychosocial assessments were repeated immediately following the intervention period, and health care providers who were blinded to participant assignment recorded the frequency of medical visits and the number of days injured or ill until the end of the season. Athletes randomly assigned to a CBSM group experienced significant reductions in the number of illness and injury days as compared to control group athletes. CBSM participants also had half the number of health service visits as did controls. The data suggest that a time-limited CBSM intervention designed specifically for an athlete population may be an effective prophylactic treatment to reduce the incidence of injury and illness among competitive collegiate athletes.","Perna F.M., Antoni M.H., Baum A., Gordon P., Schneiderman N.",0,10.1207/S15324796ABM2501_09,1562
2035,Effects of a brief mindfulness-based intervention program for stress management among medical students: the Mindful-Gym randomized controlled study,"Pursuing undergraduate medical training can be very stressful and academically challenging experience. A 5-week mindfulness-based stress management (MBSM/Mindful-Gym) program was developed to help medical students cope with stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing stress among students in a medical school in Malaysia. Seventy-five medical students participated in the program. They were stratified according to years of studies and randomly allocated to intervention (NÂ =Â 37) and control groups (NÂ =Â 38). The following outcome variables were measured at pre- and post-intervention: mindfulness (with Mindful Awareness Attention Scale); perceived stress (with Perceived Stress Scale); mental distress (with General Health Questionnaire), and self-efficacy (with General Self-efficacy Scale). Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to analyse the effect of group (intervention vs. control) on changes in the outcome variables. There were significant improvements at one week post-intervention in all outcome variables: mindfulness (Î²Â =Â 0.19, Î”R2Â =Â 0.04, pÂ =Â .040, f2Â =Â 0.05), perceived stress (Î²Â =Â âˆ’0.26, Î”R2Â =Â 0.07, pÂ =Â .009, f2Â =Â 0.10); mental distress (Î²Â =Â âˆ’0.28, Î”R2Â =Â 0.10, pÂ =Â .003, f2Â =Â 0.15); and self-efficacy (Î²Â =Â 0.30, Î”R2Â =Â 0.09, pÂ <Â .001, f2Â =Â 0.21). Six months after the intervention, those who had joined the program reported higher self-efficacy compared to those in the control group (Î²Â =Â 0.24, Î”R2Â =Â 0.06, pÂ =Â .020, f2Â =Â 0.08); but there was no difference in other outcome measures. More than 90Â % of the participants found the program applicable in helping patients and all reported that they would recommend it to others. This study indicates that the program is potentially an effective stress management program for medical students in Malaysia.

2036,A Preliminary Evaluation of the 1-2-3-Magic Parenting Program in an Australian Community Services Setting,"Cognitive-behavioural parenting programs provide caregivers with alternative strategies to harsh disciplining practices but the choice of programs that are evidence-based in Australia is limited. Australian community service workers suggest that having a choice of evidence-based programs is important when matching programs to client needs, and that 1-2-3 Magic is a program used widely in Australia despite its small Australian evidence base. The efficacy of the 1-2-3 Magic program has previously been shown in a controlled trial in an Australian university research setting but little is known about its effectiveness in a real-world setting. This study examined a three-session group-format of the Australian 1-2-3 Magic & Emotion Coaching program in a typical metropolitan community service setting. Thirty-eight caregivers with children aged 2-6 years reported a significant decrease in disruptive child behaviour (ECBI), permissive parenting (PS), and parental depression and stress (DASS) from pre- to post-intervention, with results maintained at 3-month follow-up. While these findings suggest that a brief 1-2-3 Magic program is beneficial, it is important to note that methodological limitations (intervention-group only study design and possible confounding variables) do not allow ruling out alternative causes for these improvements. Further research will be needed to confirm that this program can generalise to real-world settings.","Porzig-Drummond, Renata; Stevenson, Richard J.; Stevenson, Caroline",0,10.1080/0312407X.2015.1086010,1564
2038,Psychological and symptomatic stress-related disorders with radio-electric treatment: Psychometric evaluation,"The purpose of this study was the evaluation of the effectiveness in the improvement of the psychic and symptomatic stress-related disorders by means of radio-electric stimulation on some auricular reflex points with a device named the radio-electric asymmetric conveyer (REAC). This study was conducted on 124 subjects with psychological distress symptoms that were assessed by the Symptomatic Check List-90 (SCL-90) pre- and post-intervention. After randomization, two groups were created: a group treated with effective REAC and a group that underwent the same treatment with disarmed REAC (the placebo group). There was a significant reduction in SCL-90 scores in the treated group compared with the placebo group. The results of the psychometric tests showed that the subjects who underwent effective therapy showed a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduction in their level of stress and psychological disorders compared with the control group. The reduction of the levels of perceived stress and the reduction of the psychic and symptomatic stress-related disorders assessed by SCL-90 tests, obtained after one cycle of reflex auricular protocol REAC treatment, showed that this treatment can be useful in the cure of psychological stress-related symptoms.

2039,Impact of Mindfulness-Based Teacher Training on MBSR Participant Well-Being Outcomes and Course Satisfaction,"Growing interest in mindfulness-based programs (MBPs) has resulted in increased demand for MBP teachers, raising questions around safeguarding teaching standards. Training literature emphasises the need for appropriate training and meditation experience, yet studies into impact of such variables on participant outcomes are scarce, requiring further investigation. This feasibility pilot study hypothesised that participant outcomes would relate to teachersâ€™ mindfulness-based teacher training levels and mindfulness-based teaching and meditation experience. Teachers (nÂ =Â 9) with different MBP training levels delivering mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) courses to the general public were recruited together with their course participants (nÂ =Â 31). A teacher survey collected data on their mindfulness-based teacher training, other professional training and relevant experience. Longitudinal evaluations using online questionnaires measured participant mindfulness and well-being before and after MBSR and participant course satisfaction. Course attendeesâ€™ gains after the MBSR courses were correlated with teacher training and experience. Gains in well-being and reductions in perceived stress were significantly larger for the participant cohort taught by teachers who had completed an additional year of mindfulness-based teacher training and assessment. No correlation was found between course participantsâ€™ outcomes and their teacherâ€™s mindfulness-based teaching and meditation experience. Our results support the hypothesis that higher mindfulness-based teacher training levels are possibly linked to more positive participant outcomes, with implications for training in MBPs. These initial findings highlight the need for further research on mindfulness-based teacher training and course participant outcomes with larger participant samples.

2040,Stress management intervention via the Internet among students: Review of the literature [Intervention de gestion du stress par Internet chez les Ã©tudiantsÂ : revue de la littÃ©rature],"Internet has become an indispensable tool in the field of self-help. The intervention of Internet stress management is one of this: it is based on participation in an accessible online program to offer assistance, intervention to the therapeutic aim. This type of intervention presents several advantages. It reduced the cost in terms of time and expenses, the possibility to disseminate widely, and therefore in an economic way to a big part of the population, and increased availability with access at all time of the day, and guaranteed confidentiality to participants. The review of the literature in this area has enabled us to find six articles on the programs whose effectiveness is studied on students. This work presents the methodologies and stress management techniques most frequently proposed, aspect of efficiency, as well as the interest and limits of such interventions. Four studies out of 6 were randomized. Five studies are based on a sample of students, workers and the unemployed. The number of participants in the samples floats between 95 and 904; the first 5 studies measure the effect of the intervention and the last deals with the problem of maintenance over time of the program. Among the first 5 studies, 3 showed that the program was effective and realized its goal, while 2 others saw the programs as a complementary treatment or possessing potentially beneficial effects. All studies reflect the necessity to conduct further studies to resolve the methodological issues. The contributions, limitations and shortages of these interventions were discussed.

2041,Interest of computer-based cognitive behavioral stress management. Feasability of the Seren@ctif program [IntÃ©rÃªt d'un programme self help de gestion du stress sur support numÃ©rique. Ã‰tude de faisabilitÃ© du programme Seren@ctif],"Introduction Cognitive-behavioural stress management programs have been studied in many countries. Many reports have shown beyond a doubt their efficacy to reduce perceived stress, anxiety symptoms and to improve quality of life of patients. Considering the very large number of people who could benefit from such programs but are unable to reach them, self-help programs have been offered. First presented as books (bibliotherapy), these programs then became enriched by computing and digital supports. Regrettably, many of the programs of stress management based on the Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) both in face-to-face and on digital support have been little evaluated in France. To our knowledge, the Seren@ctif program is the first French language self-help program of stress management proposed on digital support. Aim of the study We led a feasibility study of this program on 10Â patients responding to the diagnosis of adjustment disorder with anxiety according to the DSMÂ IV criteria. Methods The program includes 5Â weekly sessions that the patient follows in our unit from a web site. He benefits from minimal contact with a medical member of staff before and after every session. Right from the first session an USB key is supplied to the patient containing videos, audio files, self-help book portfolio in the form of an e-guide, and log books with the exercises to be realized between each sessions of the 5Â session program. The patient is encouraged to practice 20Â minutes of exercises 5Â or 6Â days per week. The program's feasibility has been assessed in accordance with a standard satisfaction scale. Anxiety symptomatology has been quantified thanks to the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y-S). Results After the scheduled 5Â weeks, good results were found in terms of acceptability and attractiveness. The average score to the satisfaction survey was at least equal to 4Â out of 5Â for each item. The mean score on the STAI-State decreased from 53,4 (SD: 8,29) to 44,2 (SD: 7,73) following the intervention. Discussion The Seren@ctif program may be useful within the framework of a psychoeducative approach. It could also be advised for people suffering from anxiety related to stress. Soon, the program will be tested on patients with usual care suffering from adjustment disorder with anxiety in order to precisely assess its benefits.

2042,Mindfulness-based stress reduction in medical settings,"Meditation, as a psychological intervention, has become of increasing interest to psychologists who conduct clinical research with or provide clinical services to medical populations. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a manualized program which teaches a variety of meditation techniques and has frequently been used in medical settings with mixed medical populations. The following is a review of the literature, which provides preliminary support for the effectiveness of MBSR in specific medical populations, including persons with chronic pain, cancer and heart disease. Despite these encouraging findings, experts agree that continued research is needed, especially controlled studies with more rigorous methodology.

2043,Cognitive behavioral therapy for depressed adolescents exposed to interpersonal trauma: An initial effectiveness trial,"Four clinical trials have shown that a history of interpersonal trauma is associated with diminished response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for adolescent depression. An efficacious CBT protocol for adolescent depression was modified to address cognitive deficits and distortions associated with interpersonal trauma. Initial feasibility, acceptability, and treatment impact of the modified treatment (m-CBT) were evaluated in a randomized effectiveness trial conducted in community clinics. Clients were 43 referred adolescents with a depressive disorder and a history of interpersonal trauma. Adolescents either received m-CBT or usual care (UC) therapy. Results indicated that m-CBT was delivered with good fidelity by community clinicians, but that number of sessions completed was attenuated in both m-CBT and UC. Adolescents reported high levels of treatment satisfaction and acceptability for the new treatment. There were significant reductions in depressive symptoms over time, but no differences in outcomes between groups. Although the new treatment produced promising results, it did not outperform UC. Implications for treatment development are considered. Â© 2013 American Psychological Association.","Shirk S.R., DePrince A.P., Crisostomo P.S., Labus J.",0,10.1037/a0034845,1570
2044,The effect for Japanese workers of a self-help computerized cognitive behaviour therapy program with a supplement soft drink,"Background: Computerized cognitive behaviour therapy (CCBT) programs can provide a useful self-help approach to the treatment of psychological problems. Previous studies have shown that CCBT has moderate effects on depression, insomnia, and anxiety. The present study investigated whether a supplement drink that includes L-carnosine enhances the effect of CCBT on psychological well-being.Methods: Eighty-seven participants were randomly allocated to a control group, CCBT, or CCBT with supplement drink. The CCBT and CCBT with supplement drink groups received six weekly self-help CCBT program instalments, which consisted of psycho-education about stress management and coping, behaviour activation, and cognitive restructuring. The CCBT group consumed a bottle of the supplement soft drink every morning through the 6 weeks. This program was delivered by an e-learning system on demand and also included a self-help guidebook. Seventy-two participants completed the program or were assess at the end of the study.Results: ANOVA revealed that there were significant interactions (times x groups) for POMS tension-anxiety and fatigue. The CCBT group showed significantly improved tension-anxiety scores, whereas the CCBT with drink group showed significant improvements on fatigue.Conclusion: The self-help CCBT program reduced the subjective experience of tension-anxiety in this group of workers. The addition of a supplement drink enhanced the effect of CCBT on fatigue, providing one possible approach to enhancement of such programs.","Shirotsuki, Kentaro; Nonaka, Yuji; Abe, Keiichi; Adachi, So-ichiro; Adachi, Shohei; Kuboki, Tomifusa; Nakao, Mutsuhiro",0,10.1186/s13030-017-0109-5,1571
2045,The structure of peritraumatic dissociation: A cross validation in clinical and nonclinical samples,"Empirical data have challenged the unidimensionality of the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experiences Questionnaire (PDEQ), a widely used measure for peritraumatic dissociation. The aim of this study was to assess the factor structure of the PDEQ in 3 trauma-exposed samples: (a) trauma-exposed police officers (N = 219); (b) trauma-exposed civilians (N = 158); and (c) treatment-seeking trauma-exposed civilians (N = 185). Confirmatory factor analyses using measurement invariance testing supported a 2-factor structure (CFIs .96-.98; RMSEAs .07-.09), but excluded 2 of the original items. Factor 1 was termed Altered Awareness; Factor 2 was termed Derealization. Altered Awareness reflected disturbances in information processing during the traumatic event, whereas Derealization reflected distortions in perception. Hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that Derealization predicted posttraumatic stress severity at 26.5 weeks follow-up only in the sample of police officers (R 2 = .45). Future longitudinal research shortly following trauma is required to elucidate causality and underlying mechanisms of peritraumatic dissociation, which may contribute to the development of more accurate screening strategies, as well as more effective strategies for prevention and early intervention.<?vsp -3.25pt?> Â© 2012 International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies.","Sijbrandij M., Engelhard I.M., Opmeer B.C., van de Schoot R., Carlier I.V.E., Gersons B.P.R., Olff M.",0,10.1002/jts.21716,1572

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to pilot test the effectiveness of a culturally adapted diabetes self-management intervention. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned in an unbalanced design to the Partners in Care intervention (n=48) or wait list control group (n=34). Assessments of hemoglobin A1c, understanding of diabetes self-management, performance of self-care activities, and diabetes-related distress were measured at baseline and 3 months (post intervention).

2048,"An examination of the roles of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder on emotion regulation strategies of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn veterans","Theories of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) implicate emotional processes, including difficulties utilizing adaptive emotion regulation strategies, as critical to the etiology and maintenance of PTSD. Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) veterans report high levels of combat exposure and PTSD. We aimed to extend findings suggesting that emotion regulation difficulties are a function of PTSD, rather than combat trauma exposure or common comorbidities, to OIF/OEF/OND veterans, in order to inform models of PTSD risk and recovery that can be applied to returning veterans. We tested differences in emotion regulation, measured with the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, among trauma-exposed veterans with (nÂ =Â 24) or without PTSD (nÂ =Â 22) andÂ healthy civilian comparison participants (nÂ =Â 27) using multivariate analyses of covariance, adjusting for major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and demographic variables (age, sex, and ethnicity). Veterans with PTSD reported more use of expressive suppression and more difficulties with emotion regulation than veterans without PTSD and healthy comparison participants.Â Groups did not differ on cognitive reappraisal. Findings suggest the key role of PTSD above and beyond trauma exposure, depression, and anxiety in specific aspects of emotion dysregulation among OIF/OEF/OND veterans. Interventions that help veterans expand and diversify their emotion regulation skills may serve as helpful adjunctive treatments for PTSD among OIF/OEF/OND veterans.

2049,Reducing depression in stroke survivors and their informal caregivers: A randomized clinical trial of a web-based intervention,"Purpose/Objectives: To develop and test the efficacy of a Web-based intervention for alleviating depression in male stroke survivors (SSs) and their spousal caregivers (CGs) that blends both peer and professional support. Design and Methods: The research consisted of an intervention protocol evaluated by a focus group of rehabilitation professionals, a ""think aloud"" session conducted with female stroke CGs, and a usability test of the intervention's online features with 7 female stroke CGs. Efficacy of the final protocol was tested in a 2-group randomized clinical trial with a sample of 32 CG-SS dyads. The CGs in the intervention condition received an online group intervention. Intervention components were based on the Stress Process Model. Those CGs in a control condition received minimal support with individualized access to relevant online information. Measures of depression, as well as the secondary outcomes of mastery, self-esteem, and social support, were obtained from SSs and CGs at pretest, posttest, and 1-month later. Results: At posttest and 1 month later, CGs in the intervention condition reported significantly lower depression than CGs in the control condition with baseline depression controlled. There was no significant effect on depression among SSs. Although no significant treatment effects for either SSs or CGs were found on the secondary outcomes, posttreatment changes on some constructs were significantly correlated with change in depression. Conclusions/Implications: CGs benefit from Web-based programs that help them better understand both their emotional needs and those of the SS.

This study explores the relationship between psychosocial resources invoked through the Pathfinders intervention and outcomes. Methods: Advanced breast cancer patients were enrolled in a prospective, single-arm, pilot study of the Pathfinders psychosocial program. Participants met at least monthly with a licensed clinical social worker who administered the Pathfinders intervention, which focused on strengthening adaptive coping skills, identifying inner strengths, and developing a self-care plan. Longitudinal assessments over 6 months used validated instruments to assess changes in Pathfinders targets (coping, social support, self-efficacy, spirituality, and optimism) and outcomes (distress, despair, QOL, and fatigue). Multiple linear regression models examined the joint effect of average changes in target subscales on average outcome changes, adjusted for baseline outcome scores and patient characteristics. Results: Participants (n = 44) were: mean age 51 (SD, 12), 20% non-Caucasian, 50% college degree, and 75% married. Improvements in active coping skills, self-efficacy, and spiritual meaning/peace significantly correlated with an improvement in despair after adjustment for demographic characteristics (all P<0.05). Improvements in social support significantly correlated with positive changes in distress (P<0.05). Gains in learned optimism independently correlated with an increase in overall QOL (P<0.01). Conclusions: In this pilot assessment, changes in pre-defined Pathfinders targets such as coping skills, social support, self-efficacy, spirituality, and optimism correlated with improvements in patient-reported outcomes.

2051,A controlled examination of two coping skills for daily alcohol use and PTSD symptom severity among dually diagnosed individuals,"Investigations of targeted coping skills could help guide initial treatment decisions for individuals with co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol dependence (AD) who often endorse worse coping skills than those with AD but not PTSD. Although improvement in coping skills is associated with enhanced alcohol use outcomes, no study has evaluated the utility of teaching specific coping skills in the context of comorbid PTSD/AD. We compared the effects of teaching two coping skills (cognitive restructuring [CR] and experiential acceptance [EA]) or an attention control condition on drinking and PTSD symptoms among 78 men and women with comorbid PTSD/AD during a 5-week daily follow-up assessment. Both CR and EA skills were associated with decreased drinking compared to control, and that change in drinking over time did not significantly differ between those who received CR and EA. Individuals who received CR skills, however, consumed less alcohol on a given day than those who received EA skills. Neither CR nor EA was associated with a decrease in PTSD symptom severity. These results provide preliminary support for clinicians to prioritize CR and EA skills during initial treatment sessions when working with individuals with PTSD/AD, and offer ideas for continued investigation and intervention refinement.

2052,Group critical incident stress debriefing with emergency services personnel: A randomized controlled trial,"Although single-session individual debriefing is contraindicated, the efficacy of group psychological debriefing remains unresolved. We conducted the first randomized controlled trial of critical incident stress debriefing (CISD) with emergency workers (67 volunteer fire-fighters) following shared exposure to an occupational potentially traumatic event (PTE). The goals of group CISD are to prevent post-traumatic stress and promote return to normal functioning following a PTE. To assess both goals we measured four outcomes, before and after the intervention: post-traumatic stress, psychological distress, quality of life, and alcohol use. Fire brigades were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions: (1) CISD, (2) Screening (i.e., no-treatment), or (3) stress management Education. Controlling for pre-intervention scores, CISD was associated with significantly less alcohol use post-intervention relative to Screening, and significantly greater post-intervention quality of life relative to Education. There were no significant effects on post-traumatic stress or psychological distress. Overall, CISD may benefit broader functioning following exposure to work-related PTEs. Future research should focus on individual, group, and organizational factors and processes that can promote recovery from operational stressors. Ultimately, an occupational health (rather than victim-based) approach will provide the best framework for understanding and combating potential threats to the health and well-being of workers at high risk for PTE exposure.

2053,Physical activity buffers fatigue only under low chronic stress,"Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported complaints in the general population. As physical activity (PA) has been shown to have beneficial effects, we hypothesized that everyday life PA improves fatigue. Thirty-three healthy students (21 women, 22.8 Â± 3.3 years, 21.7 Â± 2.3 kg/m2) completed two ambulatory assessment periods. During five days at the beginning of the semester (control condition) and five days during final examination preparation (examination condition), participants repeatedly reported on general fatigue (awakening, 10 am, 2 pm, 6 pm and 9 pm) by means of an electronic diary, collected saliva samples for the assessment of cortisol and Î±-amylase immediately after providing information on fatigue and wore a triaxial accelerometer to continuously record PA. Self-perceived chronic stress was assessed as a moderator. Using hierarchical linear modeling, including PA, condition (control vs. examination), sex and chronic stress as predictors, PA level during the 15 min prior to data entry did not predict momentary fatigue level. Furthermore, there was no effect of condition. However, a significant cross-level interaction of perceived chronic stress with PA was observed. In fact, the (negative) relationship between PA and fatigue was stronger in those participants with less chronic stress. Neither cortisol nor Î±-amylase was significantly related to physical activity or fatigue. Our study showed an immediate short-term buffering effect of everyday life PA on general fatigue, but only when experiencing lower chronic stress. There seems to be no short-term benefit of PA in the face of higher chronic stress. These findings highlight the importance of considering chronic stress when evaluating the effectiveness of PA interventions in different target populations, in particular among chronically stressed and fatigued subjects.

2054,"Perceived discrimination, social support, and perceived stress among people living with HIV/AIDS in China","Perceived stress among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) was associated with severe mental health problems and risk behaviors. Discrimination toward PLWH in China is prevalent. Both perceived discrimination and social supports are determinants of the stress level among PLWH. Psychological support services for PLWH in China are scarce. It is unknown whether social support is a buffer between the perceived discrimination and perceived stress. With written consent, this study surveyed 258 PLWH recruited from multiple sources in two cities in China. Instruments were validated in previous or the present study, including the perceived stress scale for PLWH (PSSHIV), the perceived social support scale (PSSS), and the perceived discrimination scale for PLWH (PDSHIV). Pearson correlations and multiple regression models were fit. PDSHIV was associated with the Overall Scale and all subscales of PSSHIV, whilst lower socioeconomic status in general and lower scores of PSSS were associated with various subscales of PSSHIV. The interaction item (PSSSÃ—PSDHIV) was nonsignificant in modeling PSSHIV, hence no significant moderating effect was detected. Whilst perceived discrimination is a major source of stress and social support can reduce stress among PLWH in China, improved social support cannot buffer the stressful consequences due to perceived discrimination. The results highlight the importance to reduce discrimination toward PLWH and the difficulty to alleviate its negative consequences. It is warranted to improve mental health among PLWH in China and it is still important to foster social support among PLWH as it has direct effects on perceived stress.

Methods: 258 PLWH in China were recruited and interviewed with a structured questionnaire including measurements testing perceived stress, social support, perceived discrimination, and depression. Mediating effect of perceived stress between perceived discrimination and depression and moderating effect of social support on effect of perceived discrimination and perceived stress to depression were tested. Multivariate regression was used to examine the determinants of depression. Results: The prevalence of mild to severe depression is 71.9%. The relationship between the perceived discrimination and depression is fully mediated by perceived stress (perceived discrimination that was statistically significant (Î²=0.153) to depression became non-significant after adding perceived stress in the regression model). Interaction term between social support and perceived stress has negative effects (Î²=-0.117) and explained a significant amount of variance (R 2=0.018) in depression. Lower income, and higher perceived stress predicted more depressive symptoms. Limitations: Cross-sectional study and self-report bias are major limitations of this study. Conclusion: Depression among PLWH is a severe problem in China. Primary health care workers need to be trained in recognition and treatment in depression. Stress management skills and social support for PLWH are warranted.

2056,"Cumulative Violence Exposure, Emotional Nonacceptance, and Mental Health Symptoms in a Community Sample of Women","Women exposed to more types of violence (e.g., emotional, physical, or sexual violence)-referred to here as cumulative violence exposure-are at risk for more severe mental health symptoms compared to women who are exposed to a single type of violence or no violence. Women exposed to violence may also experience greater emotional nonacceptance compared to women with no exposure to violence. Emotional nonacceptance refers to an unwillingness to experience emotional states, including cognitive and behavioral attempts to avoid experiences of emotion. Given the links between cumulative violence exposure, emotional nonacceptance, and mental health symptoms among female victims of violence, the current study tested victims' emotional nonacceptance as a partial mediator between cumulative violence exposure and the severity of 3 types of symptoms central to complex trauma responses: depression, dissociation, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. A non-treatment-seeking community sample of women (N = 89; M age = 30.70 years) completed self-report questionnaires and interviews. Bootstrap procedures were then used to test 3 mediation models for the separate predictions of depression, dissociation, and PTSD symptoms. Results supported our hypotheses that emotional nonacceptance would mediate the relationship between women's cumulative violence exposure and severity for all symptom types. The current findings highlight the role that emotional nonacceptance may play in the development of mental health symptoms for chronically victimized women and point to the need for longitudinal research in such populations.

2058,Effect of baseline self-efficacy on physical activity and psychological stress after a one-week pedometer intervention,"Physical activity and psychological stress were hypothesized to improve more in participants with high self-efficacy than in those with low and medium self-efficacy, after a one-week intervention. 39 female university students participated. The intervention had two steps: a lecture on self-monitoring and goal setting (160 min.) and a one-week pedometer intervention. Analyses were conducted on tertile groups according to self-efficacy at baseline. Pedometer step counts were higher in the high self-efficacy group than in the low self-efficacy group after intervention. Helplessness decreased time dependently after intervention only in the high-self-efficacy group. Because physical activity improved more in the high self-efficacy group after a one-week intervention, one hypothesis was supported.

2059,Impact of biofeedback on self-efficacy and stress reduction in obesity: A randomized controlled pilot study,"Biofeedback application is an evidence-based technique to induce relaxation. A primary mechanism of action is the improvement of self-efficacy, which is needed to facilitate the translation of health behavioral intentions into action. Obesity is often associated with low self-efficacy and dysfunctional eating patterns, including comfort eating as an inexpedient relaxation technique. This is the first study investigating the effects of biofeedback on self-efficacy and relaxation in obesity. In the present experiment, 31 women, mean body mass index 35.5 kg/mÃ‚, were randomized to a food-specific biofeedback paradigm, a non-specific relaxation biofeedback paradigm, or a waiting list control. Eight sessions of biofeedback of the electrodermal activity were performed while presenting either a challenging food stimulus or a non-specific landscape stimulus. Self-efficacy, stress, ability to relax, eating behavior, and electrodermal activity were assessed before, directly after, and 3 months after the intervention. The food-specific biofeedback predominantly showed effects on food-related self-efficacy and perceived stress. The non-specific relaxation biofeedback showed effects on the ability to relax. Self-reported improvements were confirmed by corresponding decrease in the electrodermal reaction to food stimuli. Biofeedback treatment is effective in improving self-efficacy in individuals with obesity and might therefore be a valuable additional intervention in obesity treatment.

2060,The effectiveness of email-based exercises in promoting psychological wellbeing and healthy lifestyle: A two-year follow-up study,"Background: Web-based interventions provide a possibility to enhance well-being in large groups of people. Only a few studies have studied the effectiveness of the interventions and there is no information on the sustainability of the effects. Study aims were to investigate both the short (2-month) and long-term (2-year) effects of email-based training for mental health and lifestyle. Methods: Persons who completed an 'Electronic Health Check', as advertised in a TV program, were offered a chance to participate in email-based interventions. The baseline questionnaire was completed by 73 054 people, with 42 761 starting interventions, and 16 499 people participating in at least one of the follow-ups. Persons who did not choose to start the interventions served as controls. Results: At baseline, the intervention group had a higher level of stress and lower gratitude and confidence in the future than the control group. Both groups showed improvement in the level of stress, but improvement was more marked in the intervention group (P <.001 for both time points). In confidence in the future and gratitude, people who chose interpersonal interventions showed significant improvements at both time points (P <.001), whereas those choosing lifestyle interventions showed improvement only at the 2-month follow-up. Participants who had done the exercises according to instructions had the most sustained improvements in measures of psychological health at the 2-year follow-up. As for lifestyle, people who had started lifestyle interventions increased their exercise (P <.001 at both time points). Conclusions: Internet-based interventions are feasible for mental health promotion and should be available for people interested in improving their psychological well-being and lifestyle.

2061,"A Preliminary Study Investigating the Effectiveness of the Caring for Body and Mind in Pregnancy (CBMP) in Reducing Perinatal Depression, Anxiety and Stress","Prenatal mental illness is a significant public health issue with intergenerational consequences. Caring for Body and Mind in Pregnancy (CBMP) is an Australian, 8-week mindful parenting program. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of CBMP in reducing pregnant womenâ€™s levels of depression, anxiety, perinatal depression, perinatal anxiety and stress. The sample consisted of 109 pregnant women at-risk for perinatal depression and anxiety. The mean age of the sample was 33.52 years (SD = 4.90), ranging from 21 to 45 years. A within group, pre-post research design was used to examine whether CBMP improves participantsâ€™ scores on outcome measures. Wilcoxon Signed Rank test results indicated that CBMP significantly reduced depression, anxiety, perinatal depression, perinatal anxiety and general stress scores, while significantly increasing self-compassion and mindfulness with moderate to strong effect sizes. The double mediation hypothesis was supported with self-compassion t (71) = âˆ’2.23, p < 03, b2 = âˆ’1.96, SE = 88, 95% CI = âˆ’3.71, âˆ’.20, having a stronger influence in reducing perinatal depression than mindfulness t (71) = âˆ’2.68, p <.01, b3 = âˆ’.07, SE =.03, 95% CI = âˆ’.13, âˆ’.02.

More than 50% of the sick leave is because of subjective health complaints. Work place physical exercise interventions have a documented positive effect on sick leave.After baseline screening, employees who had agreed to participate (n = 40) were randomized to an intervention or control group. The intervention group participated in an Integrated Health Programme twice weekly during working hours. The programme consisted of physical exercise, stress management training, health information and an examination of the participants' workplace. The control group was offered the same intervention after the project was finished. This study was carried out from 2001 to 2002.There were no statistically significant effects on sick leave or health-related quality of life. The intervention group reported fewer neck complaints compared to the control group, but otherwise there were no effects on subjective health complaints. However, the subjective effects were large and highly statistically significant, the intervention group reporting improvement in health, physical fitness, muscle pain, stress management, maintenance of health and work situation.The Integrated Health Programme was not effective in reducing sick leave and subjective health complaints, but may be of use to employers wanting to increase employee job satisfaction and well-being.","Tveito, Torill H.; Eriksen, Hege R.",0,10.1111/j.1365-2648.2008.04846.x,1587
2063,Restorative effects of virtual nature settings,"Previous research regarding the potential benefits of exposing individuals to surrogate nature (photographs and videos) has found that such immersion results in restorative effects such as increased positive affect, decreased negative affect, and decreased stress. In the current experiment, we examined whether immersion in a virtual computer-generated nature setting could produce restorative effects. Twenty-two participants were equally divided between two conditions, while controlling for gender. In each condition, participants performed a stress-induction task, and were then immersed in virtual reality (VR) for 10 minutes. The control condition featured a slide show in VR, and the nature experimental condition featured an active exploration of a virtual forest. Participants in the nature condition were found to exhibit increased positive affect and decreased stress after immersion in VR when compared to those in the control condition. The results suggest that immersion in virtual nature settings has similar beneficial effects as exposure to surrogate nature. These results also suggest that VR can be used as a tool to study and understand restorative effects.

2064,"Physical Activity, Mindfulness Meditation, or Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback for Stress Reduction: A Randomized Controlled Trial","In contemporary western societies stress is highly prevalent, therefore the need for stress-reducing methods is great. This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of self-help physical activity (PA), mindfulness meditation (MM), and heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) in reducing stress and its related symptoms. We randomly allocated 126 participants to PA, MM, or HRV-BF upon enrollment, of whom 76 agreed to participate. The interventions consisted of psycho-education and an introduction to the specific intervention techniques and 5Â weeks of daily exercises at home. The PA exercises consisted of a vigorous-intensity activity of free choice. The MM exercises consisted of guided mindfulness meditation. The HRV-BF exercises consisted of slow breathing with a heart rate variability biofeedback device. Participants received daily reminders for their exercises and were contacted weekly to monitor their progress. They completed questionnaires prior to, directly after, and 6Â weeks after the intervention. Results indicated an overall beneficial effect consisting of reduced stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and improved psychological well-being and sleep quality. No significant between-intervention effect was found, suggesting that PA, MM, and HRV-BF are equally effective in reducing stress and its related symptoms. These self-help interventions provide easily accessible help for people with stress complaints.

2065,An analogue trial of inoculation/resilience training for emergency services personnel: Proof of concept,"Background and objectives: This analogue study served as a proof of concept trial for inoculation/resilience training with emergency services personnel. Methods: Eighty people from the general community participated in a randomized controlled trial of inoculation training to increase resilience in the mitigation of stress and trauma-type symptomatology following a stressful video of paramedics attending the scene of a car accident. Participants were randomly allocated to one of two conditions: (a) resilience training, where the participants received strategies aimed at reducing the negative effects of the event; or (b) a control 'pragmatic training' condition, where participants received practical training about what to do in the event of a car accident. A week later the full video was shown. All participants were assessed one month later. Results: Unlike with past studies which tested psychological debriefing, analyses revealed that inoculation/resilience training did not appear to have deleterious effects on psychological distress measures or memory performance. Participants who received the resilience training displayed improvements in negative affect (notable trends in depression and stress levels) suggesting a more general positive result from the intervention than normal 'pragmatic training'. Limitations: This was an analogue trial and a full field trial is warranted. Conclusions: With organisations wishing to engage in resilience training, this analogue study suggests that inoculation training at least does no harm and may be beneficial. It is, therefore, a viable option for emergency services personnel during pre-deployment training. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Varker T., Devilly G.J.",0,10.1016/j.janxdis.2012.01.009,1590

However, limited evidence is available for the effectiveness of participatory interventions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect on mental health among nurses of a participatory intervention to improve the psychosocial work environment. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in hospital settings. A total of 434 nurses in 24 units were randomly allocated to 11 intervention units (n=183) and 13 control units (n=218). A participatory program was provided to the intervention units for 6 months. Depressive symptoms as mental health status and psychosocial work environment, assessed by the Job Content Questionnaire, the Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire, and the Quality Work Competence questionnaire, were measured before and immediately after the 6-month intervention by a self-administered questionnaire. Results: No significant intervention effect was observed for mental health status. However, significant intervention effects were observed in psychosocial work environment aspects, such as Coworker Support (p<0.01) and Goals (p<0.01), and borderline significance was observed for Job Control (p<0.10). Conclusions: It is suggested that a 6-month participatory intervention is effective in improving psychosocial work environment, but not mental health, among Japanese nurses.","Uchiyama, Ayako; Odagiri, Yuko; Ohya, Yumiko; Takamiya, Tomoko; Inoue, Shigeru; Shimomitsu, Teruichi",1,10.1539/joh.12-0228-OA,1591
2067,Surgical nurses' work-related stress when caring for severely ill and dying patients in cancer after participating in an educational intervention on existential issues,"Aim: The aim of this study was to describe surgical nurses' perceived work-related stress in the care of severely ill and dying patients with cancer after participating in an educational intervention on existential issues. Methods and sample: This article reports a mixed methods pilot study of an education programme consisting of lectures and supervised discussions conducted in 2009-2010 in three surgical wards in a county hospital in Sweden. The concurrent data collections consisted of repeated interviews with eleven nurses in an educational group, and questionnaires were distributed to 42 nurses on four occasions. Results: Directly after the educational intervention, the nurses described working under high time pressure. They also described being hindered in caring because of discrepancies between their caring intentions and what was possible in the surgical care context. Six months later, the nurses described a change in decision making, and a shift in the caring to make it more in line with their own intentions and patients' needs rather than the organizational structure. They also reported decreased feelings of work-related stress, decreased stress associated with work-load and feeling less disappointed at work. Conclusions: Results indicate that it may be possible to influence nurses' work-related stress through an educational intervention. According to nurses' descriptions, reflecting on their ways of caring for severely ill and dying patients, many of whom had cancer, from an existential perspective, had contributed to enhanced independent decision making in caring. This in turn appears to have decreased their feelings of work-related stress and disappointment at work.

To control for expectation effects, progressive muscular relaxation (PMR) was the control condition. Forty-four patients with a blood pressure response greater than 15 nun Hg to a mental stress test participated in this study. Participants who took part in SMT showed a significantly stronger reduction of diastolic blood pressure reactivity, to a mental stress test from pretest to post test than the controls. Furthermore, patients who took part in SMT showed significantly smaller systolic blood pressure reactions to mental arithmetic and 2 social stress tests than the controls after the trainings.

2069,"Screening for distress, the sixth vital sign: Examining self-referral in people with cancer over a one-year period","Purpose Although research has indicated a diagnosis of cancer is most often distressing for patients and their families, few studies have examined which patients access resources to manage distress or how distress levels affect resource utilization. This study explored psychosocial and supportive care resource utilization in a large cancer population at a Canadian tertiary cancer centre over a 12-month period in a usual care setting. Methods Patients who were new to the Tom Baker Cancer Centre completed the Distress Thermometer, the Pain and Fatigue Thermometers, the Psychological Screen for Cancer (Part C) that measures anxiety and depression, self-report questions on resources accessed and a demographic form at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. No feedback or specific triage to services was provided in order to observe usual care practices. Results A total of 714 patients provided baseline data with 505 retained at 12 months. Twenty-four percent indicated they accessed at least one service (e.g. individual counselling, nutritionist or resource social worker) over the 12 months. Patients who were older, less educated and with lower income were less likely to access services. People who reported higher symptom burden were more likely to access services at each time point. Conclusions Overall levels of access of psychosocial services were relatively low in this population and varied by socio-demographic variables and symptom burden. Routine monitoring of psychosocial, practical and physical concerns is a potential strategy for targeting individuals who may require additional information or support in accessing available services to manage their concerns.

2070,The Effects of an E-Mental Health Program and Job Coaching on the Risk of Major Depression and Productivity in Canadian Male Workers: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Major depression (MDE) is prevalent in men and affects men's health and productivity. Because of the stigma against depression and social/gender norms, men are less likely to seek help for emotion and stress-related issues. Therefore, innovative solutions tailored for men are needed. With rapid development of the Internet and information technologies, one promising solution that has drawn considerable attentions is electronic mental (e-mental) health programs and services.Objective: The objective of our study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the e-mental health program BroHealth on reducing the risk of having MDE and improving productivity and return to investment.Methods: The target population is Canadian working men who are at high risk of having MDE (N=1200). Participants will be recruited using the method of random digit dialing across the country and workplace advertisement. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated into the following groups: (1) a control group, (2) a group receiving BroHealth only, and (3) a group receiving BroHealth and telephone-based job coaching service. The groups will be assessed at 6 and 12 months after randomization. The primary outcome is the risk proportion of MDE over 12 months, which will be assessed by the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form for Major Depression. Intention-to-treat principle will be used in the analysis. The 12-month proportions of MDE in the groups will be estimated and compared. Logistic regression modeling will be used to examine the effect of the intervention on the outcome, controlling for the effects of baseline confounders.Results: It is anticipated that the randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be completed by 2018.

This paper reviewed two types of intervention for parents with ID: those designed to strengthen social relationships and those teaching parenting skills. A literature search was conducted using electronic databases and a limited number of evaluative studies were found. The evidence for interventions aimed at strengthening social relationships was inconclusive; although positive changes were observed, there were limitations in study design which restricted the generalizability of the results. The evidence for parental skills teaching suggested that behavioural based interventions are more effective than less intensive forms such as lesson booklets and the provision of normal services, although these studies also had limitations. There is a need for further large scale controlled studies in this area to provide clearer evidence and to explore additional factors relating to child, parent and family which may impact on outcomes.

Method: Eight thousand seven hundred and eighty-four college students (73% female; mean age of 19.8 years) completed self-report measures. Hierarchical regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the three-way interaction in the prediction of depressive symptoms. Results: Searching for and finding meaning as well as the three-way interaction significantly contributed to the prediction of depression. Specifically, searching for meaning was associated with increased symptoms, irrespective of meaning levels among nontrauma-exposed and low frequency trauma-exposed emerging adults. Among high frequency trauma-exposed individuals, an increase in the search-by-find meaning interaction predicted fewer symptoms. Conclusions: The findings suggest that searching for and finding meaning are important mechanisms in the prediction of depression among emerging adults facing daily stressors and traumatic events.

2076,A pilot videoconference group stress management program in cancer survivors: Lessons learned,"Context: Cancer is a challenging experience and there is evidence that psychosocial interventions are effective at improving adjustment following treatment. At our cancer center, 14 cancer survivors (breast, prostate and blood cancers) completed a foursession cognitive-behavioral stress program. The first session was delivered at the survivor's local cancer center, where they were provided with a loaner tablet. The three subsequent sessions were delivered through group-based videoconference on the tablet. Session content was supplemented with a tailored ebook, designed specifically for this program. Participants provided feedback about the program as well as a standardized measure of perceived stress. Issues: Despite evidence that psychosocial programs are effective, there are significant barriers to dissemination, particularly for those residing in rural areas who do not live near academic medical centers where such programming is more readily available. Our experiences delivering a group-based videoconference program in cancer survivors are described, including positives and challenges associated with its design and implementation. Lessons learned: Study participants enrolled from across four different US states, and the majority reported at least a 30-minute commute to their cancer center. This travel burden played a meaningful role in their desire to participate in our videoconferencebased program. Although participants reported that session content was well suited to addressing stress management concerns, and session facilitators were able to effectively teach program techniques (eg progressive muscle relaxation, cognitive-reframing) and that the program was helpful overall, only modest improvements in perceived stress were seen. Participants noted challenges of the delivery including feeling disconnected from others, difficulty focusing, technical problems, and a desire for a longer program. Thus, although the novel delivery of a group-based, psychosocial program using tablet videoconference is feasible in a survivorship program, and desired by cancer survivors, key improvements must be made in future efforts. Our enthusiasm about the potential of telehealth must be tempered with the reality that such delivery can present challenges that interfere with the intervention implementation and efficacy. Facilitators must proactively address both the technological and interpersonal challenges associated with the use of group-based videoconference in order to improve its ability to positively impact cancer survivors. Many of these issues can be resolved prior to program launch, and require foresight and planning on the part of the program team.

2077,"Association of Dispositional Mindfulness with Stress, Cortisol, and Well-Being Among University Undergraduate Students","Mindfulness has been associated with better psychological and physical health; although, the mechanisms of these benefits are poorly understood. We explored the role of mindfulness in stress-health pathways among undergraduates at a large public university. Participants reported on demographic and academic variables and completed data collection at two time points during the academic semester, approximately one month apart. At each collection, measures of mindfulness, perceived stress, and psychological well-being were gathered. Students provided two days of home-based saliva collection for assessment of cortisol. Mean scores were computed for each of the measures, over the two assessments. Hierarchical multiple regressions adjusting for GPA, hours of paid employment per week, minority status, and living situation explored the impact of mindfulness in our stress-health model. Students with higher dispositional mindfulness reported significantly less perceived stress and had lower overall mean diurnal cortisol. Mindfulness was associated with greater psychological well-being. Exploratory analyses suggested that future research should explore the potential mediating or moderating relationships between mindfulness, perceived stress, and cortisol. Findings suggest that mindfulness may help attenuate both psychological and physiological stress responses to college stress.

2078,Burnout and effort-reward imbalance improvement for teachers by a manual-based group program,"We developed a manual-based psychological group program aimed at teachers and focussing on their professional relationships. The intervention comprised ten sessions over a 10-month period. The aim of the program was to strengthen teachers' health. We investigated whether the effects of our intervention, during which the MBI and ERI were applied, result in general alleviation of occupational stress experienced by teachers.This is a randomized controlled trial. All teachers (N = 2,484) of two school types (grammar schools and secondary modern schools) in 3 districts of southwestern Germany were invited to take part in our program. All teachers declaring their interest (N = 337) in the intervention were included in the project. They were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (N = 171) or to the control group (N = 166).We found that teachers who participated in at least 50% of the program benefited from this short intervention. Significant improvement was achieved on the two MBI scales, Emotional Exhaustion and Personal Accomplishment, as well as on the ERI subscale Appreciation.Teachers' occupational stress level may be decreased by taking part in a short manual-based psychological group intervention that focuses on more effective handling of interpersonal problems in school. Therefore, teachers should receive support and guidance in developing the appropriate skills necessary to cope with stress appropriately.","Unterbrink, Thomas; Pfeifer, Ruth; Krippeit, Lorena; Zimmermann, Linda; Rose, Uwe; Joos, Andreas; Hartmann, Armin; Wirsching, Michael; Bauer, Joachim",0,10.1007/s00420-011-0712-x,1603
2079,Biofeedback-based training for stress management in daily hassles: an intervention study,"Background: The day-to-day causes of stress are called daily hassles. Daily hassles are correlated with ill health. Biofeedback (BF) is one of the tools used for acquiring stress-coping skills. However, the anatomical correlates of the effects of BF with long training periods remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate this. Methods: Participants were assigned randomly to two groups: the intervention group and the control group. Participants in the intervention group performed a biofeedback training (BFT) task (a combination task for heart rate and cerebral blood flow control) every day, for about 5 min once a day. The study outcomes included MRI, psychological tests (e.g., Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, and Brief Job Stress Questionnaire), and a stress marker (salivary cortisol levels) before (day 0) and after (day 28) the intervention. Results: We observed significant improvements in the psychological test scores and salivary cortisol levels in the intervention group compared to the control group. Furthermore, voxel-based morphometric analysis revealed that compared to the control group, the intervention group had significantly increased regional gray matter (GM) volume in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, which is an anatomical cluster that includes mainly the left hippocampus, and the left subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. The GM regions are associated with the stress response, and, in general, these regions seem to be the most sensitive to the detrimental effects of stress. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that our BFT is effective against the GM structures vulnerable to stress.","Kotozaki, Y; Takeuchi, H; Sekiguchi, A; Yamamoto, Y; Shinada, T; Araki, T; Takahashi, K; Taki, Y; Ogino, T; Kiguchi, M; Kawashima, R",0,10.1002/brb3.241,1604

2081,Building a Tobacco Cessation Telehealth Care Management Program for Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"BACKGROUND: Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have high rates of smoking. Motivational interviewing (MI) enhances readiness for change. OBJECTIVE: To test the feasibility and fidelity of home telehealth care management strategy to improve quit rates. DESIGN: A telehealth device delivered a cessation curriculum while a nurse supported veterans through weekly MI telephone calls. Treatment fidelity was evaluated. Outcomes measures included changes in smoking behaviors, stage of change, dose effect, and participant satisfaction with intervention. RESULTS: There was a correlation (r = -.677; p = .03) at the end of treatment between readiness to change and number of cigarettes smoked per day. As 11 participants progressed along stages of change, they smoked fewer cigarettes per day. Two (20%) quit smoking. The nurse adhered to MI principles. Participants were highly satisfied and 100% felt curriculum delivered new information and respected choices. CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to deliver the home telehealth care management intervention with high treatment fidelity. Participants were motivated to change smoking behaviors.","Battaglia, C; Benson, SL; Cook, PF; Prochazka, A",0,10.1177/1078390313483314,1606
2083,"Stress, coping, lifestyle and hypertension: A paradigm for research, prevention and non-pharmacological management of hypertension.","Lifestyle related factors such as obesity, drinking habits, sodium and potassium intake and physical inactivity are well established determinants of high blood pressure. The role of psyche-social stressors, and in particular environmental work or home stress is far less clear. Some but not all studies using the Karasek 'job-strain' model have found a relationship with ambulatory blood pressure levels. Other studies using more 'subjective' measures of occupational stress have found no relationship or even inverse associations with blood pressure. The possibility that relationships between external stressors, personality factors and blood pressure levels might be mediated or confounded by coping mechanisms influencing lifestyle factors known to directly affect blood pressure has not been adequately studied. This paper briefly explores the paradigm relating environmental psychosocial stress, individual coping mechanisms, lifestyle behaviours and blood pressure levels. The issues are critical for research methodology in this area and for the development of better behavioural strategies for the prevention and nonpharmacological management of hypertension.","Beilin, LJ",0,10.3109/10641969709083183,1607
2084,The Family Empowerment Program: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Working with Multi-Stressed Urban Families,"The family empowerment program (FEP) is a multi-systemic family therapy program that partners multi-stressed families with an interdisciplinary resource team while remaining attached to a traditional mental health clinic. The rationale for this model is that far too often, families presenting at community mental health centers struggle with multiple psychosocial forces, for example problems with housing, domestic violence, child care, entitlements, racism, substance abuse, and foster care, as well as chronic medical and psychiatric illnesses, that exacerbate symptoms and impact traditional service delivery and access to effective treatment. Thus, families often experience fragmented care and are involved with multiple systems with contradictory and competing agendas. As a result, services frequently fail to harness the family's inherent strengths. The FEP partners the family with a unified team that includes representatives from Entitlements Services, Family Support and Parent Advocacy, and Clinical Staff from the agency's Outpatient Mental Health Clinic practicing from a strength-based family therapy perspective. The goal of the FEP is to support the family in achieving their goals. This is accomplished through co-construction of a service plan that addresses the family's needs in an efficient and coherent manneremphasizing family strengths and competencies and supporting family self-sufficiency.","Cleek, EN; Wofsy, M; Boyd-Franklin, N; Mundy, B; Howell, TJ",0,10.1111/j.1545-5300.2012.01392.x,1608
2085,A Telephone-Based Intervention to Promote Diabetes Management in Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms,"The primary objective of this pilot study was to develop and implement a telephone intervention for veterans with diabetes and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Additional objectives were to evaluate study feasibility and to conduct exploratory analyses of the influence of the intervention on diabetic self-care, quality of life, treatment adherence, and mental health functioning. Twenty-three veterans with PTSS and diabetes enrolled in the study and received an initial assessment interview and intervention session. Twenty participants completed the study protocol in its entirety and also received 7 weekly motivational telephone calls with a clinician and a final assessment. Results revealed high levels of compliance with telephone calls. Participants reported satisfaction with and benefit from the intervention that occurred during weekly telephone calls. Participants reported a statistically significant increase in exercise behaviors and healthy eating from pre- to postintervention. Results also revealed a decrease in psychological distress. Although these data are preliminary, they speak to the feasibility and benefits of a brief telephone intervention to address self-care behaviors critical to the management of diabetes for individuals with PTSS.","Collins, AE; Niles, BL; Mori, DL; Silberbogen, AK; Seligowski, AV",0,10.1037/a0032604,1609
2086,A Novel Approach to Cardiovascular Health by Optimizing Risk Management (ANCHOR): A Primary Prevention Initiative Examining the Impact of Health Risk Factor Assessment and Management on Cardiac Wellness,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents an increasing burden to health care systems. Modifiable risk factors figure prominently in the population-attributable risk for premature coronary artery disease. Primary care is well placed to facilitate CVD risk improvement. We plan to evaluate the ability of a novel primary care intervention providing systematic risk factor screening, risk-weighted behavioural counselling and pharmacological intervention to achieve 2 objectives: (1) optimized management of global CVD risk of patients and (2) increased patient adherence to lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions aimed at decreasing global CVD risk. A pre-post longitudinal prospective design with a nonrandomized comparison group is being undertaken in 2 geographically diverse primary care practices in Nova Scotia with differing reimbursement models. Participants will complete a readiness to change and pre-post health risk assessment (HRA), that will trigger a 1-year intervention individualized around risk and readiness. The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants with Framingham moderate and high-risk strata that reduce their absolute risk by 10% and 25%, respectively. The secondary outcome will be the proportion of moderate and high-risk participants who reduce their risk category. The impact of the intervention on clinical and behavioural variables will also be examined. Low risk participants will be separately analyzed. Data from participants unable to change from the high risk category because of diabetes mellitus or established atherosclerotic disease will also be analyzed separately, with changes in clinical measures from baseline being assessed. A health economic analysis is planned.","Cox, JL; Carr, B; Vallis, TM; Szpilfogel, C; O'Neill, BJ",0,10.1016/j.cjca.2011.04.013,1610
2087,Stress management interventions for veterinary students,"The process of obtaining a veterinary medical education creates a number of potential cognitive, emotional, physical, interpersonal, and developmental stressors for veterinary students. Although most universities offer stress management interventions for their students, these programs are often directed toward undergraduate students or non-veterinary graduate students, whose educational programs differ significantly from those of veterinary students. There is a need for specific stress management programs tailored to the needs of veterinary students.

The sample of 177 freshmen was randomly assigned to a time management training (n = 89) and an active control group (CG) (n = 88). We expected that an increase in external demands during the first weeks of the semester would lead to more perceived stress in the CG, but not in the time management training group, due to the time management intervention. As hypothesised, perceived stress increased in the CG, but not in the time management training group. Furthermore, perceived control of time increased in the time management training group but remained unchanged in the CG. Even a rather short intervention of 2 h can protect freshmen from an increase in perceived stress at the beginning of the semester.","Hafner, A; Stock, A; Pinneker, L; Strohle, S",0,10.1080/01443410.2013.785065,1612
2089,The self-reported health condition of women after their participation in a stress management programme: a pilot study,"From a public health perspective, it is important to develop effective measures to deal with stress which are based on the individual's participation, such as stress management provided in group sessions. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare and evaluate the self-reported health condition of women in terms of their general symptoms, stress and sense of coherence (SOC) after participation in a stress management programme. The intervention, which had a modified crossover design and involved 40 women divided into two groups (G1 and G2), comprised eight meetings, the content of which was both theoretical and practical, and included information about stress, stress management, massage and mental training. A questionnaire was filled in on three occasions: before and after the intervention (8 weeks later), and after another 8 weeks (16 weeks later). The questionnaire contained 60 items comprising background factors, general symptoms, stress and SOC. No significant differences existed between the groups at baseline. In favour of the intervention, significant differences were found between the groups with regard to fewer general symptoms (P = 0.035) as well as a tendency to stress reduction (P = 0.060). A comparison within groups showed that both groups had a significant reduction in symptoms after the intervention (G1, P = 0.002; and G2, P = 0.003) and in reduced stress (both P = 0.001). After a further 8 weeks, both groups still showed significantly fewer general symptoms and reduced stress, as well as significant improvements with regard to SOC (G1, P = 0.012; and G2, P = 0.026). These findings indicate that the combination of mental training and massage in this stress management programme had a positive influence on the women's health condition. The pilot study design could be used in a full-scale study with randomised groups.","Haraldsson, K; Fridlund, B; Baigi, A; Marklund, B",0,10.1111/j.1365-2524.2005.00554.x,1613
2090,Rational thinking and stress management in health workers: A psychoeducational program,"The paper describes the rationale and contents of a graduate-level practicum on stress management. The course objective is consistent with the current call for improved training in psychological issues in medical education. Participants were 39 occupational health practitioners (physicians, industrial hygienists, nurses, and physiotherapists) in the Tel-Aviv University Medical School graduate program in occupational health. Twenty-five students in the same program who did not participate in the practicum were included as comparison subjects. The course was based on a cognitive-behavioral model (Rational-Emotive Behavior Training) developed by Ellis. The one-semester practicum aimed to reduce irrational/dysfunctional thinking patterns which are considered to be causal factors in stress etiology. Irrationality was significantly reduced by the end of the course and perceived psychosocial professional efficacy was increased. The improvements in such personal anti-stress resources may benefit health workers and clients alike. It is recommended to include such courses to the professional training of all health care practitioners.","Kushnir, T; Malkinson, R; Ribak, J",0,10.1023/A:1022941031900,1614
2091,"The impact of a new emotional self-management program on stress, emotions, heart rate variability, DHEA and cortisol","This study examined the effects on healthy adults of a new emotional selfmanagement program, consisting of two key techniques, ""Cut-Thru"" and the ""Heart Lock-In."" These techniques are designed to eliminate negative thought loops and promote sustained positive emotional states. The hypotheses were that training and practice in these techniques would yield lowered levels of stress and negative emotion and cortisol, while resulting in increased positive emotion and DHEA levels over a one-month period. in addition, we hypothesized that increased coherence in heart rate variability patterns would be observed during the practice of the techniques. Forty-five healthy adults participated in the study, fifteen of whom acted as a comparison group for the psychological measures. Salivary DHEA/DHEAS and cortisol levels were measured, autonomic nervous system function was assessed by heart rate variability analysis, and emotions were measured using a psychological questionnaire. Individuals in the experimental group were assessed before and four weeks after receiving training in the self-management techniques. The experimental group experienced significant increases in the positive affect scales of Caring and Vigor and significant decreases in the negative affect scales of Guilt, Hostility, Burnout, Anxiety and Stress Effects, while no significant changes were seen in the comparison group. There was a mean 23 percent reduction in cortisol and a 100 percent increase in DHEA/DHEAS in the experimental group. DHEA was significantly and positively related to the affective state Warmheartedness, whereas cortisol was significantly and positively related to Stress Effects. Increased coherence in heart rate variability patterns was measured in 80 percent of the experimental group during the use of the techniques. The results suggest that techniques designed to eliminate negative thought loops can have important positive effects on stress, emotions and key physiological systems. The implications are that relatively inexpensive interventions may dramatically and positively impact individuals' health and well-being. Thus, individuals may have greater control over their minds, bodies and health than previously suspected.","McCraty, R; Barrios-Choplin, B; Rozman, D; Atkinson, P; Watkins, AD",0,10.1007/BF02688660,1615

Stress management programs may be prohibitively expensive or have limited access. This study aims to determine feasibility of an 8-week Internet-based stress management program (ISM) based on mindfulness principles in reducing stress in a 12-week, parallel, randomized, controlled trial. Participants were randomly allocated to ISM, ISM plus online message board (ISM+), or control groups. Perceived stress, mindfulness, self-transcendence, psychological well-being, vitality, and quality of life were measured at baseline, week 8, and week 12 using standard validated questionnaires. ISM and ISM+ groups demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared with control on all measures except vitality and physical health. The ISM program effectively and sustainably reduced measures of stress. The magnitude of improvement is comparable to traditional mindfulness programs, although fewer participants were engaged. This feasibility study provides strong support for online stress management programs, which increase access at a fraction of cost of traditional programs.","Morledge, TJ; Allexandre, D; Fox, E; Fu, AZ; Higashi, MK; Kruzikas, DT; Pham, SV; Reese, PR",0,10.1007/s12160-013-9490-x,1616
2093,"Mindful ""Vitality in Practice"": an intervention to improve the work engagement and energy balance among workers; the development and design of the randomised controlled trial","Background: Modern working life has become more mental and less physical in nature, contributing to impaired mental health and a disturbed energy balance. This may result in mental health problems and overweight. Both are significant threats to the health of workers and thus also a financial burden for society, including employers. Targeting work engagement and energy balance could prevent impaired mental health and overweight, respectively.Methods/Design: The study population consists of highly educated workers in two Dutch research institutes. The intervention was systematically developed, based on the Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol, involving workers and management in the process. The workers' needs were assessed by combining the results of interviews, focus group discussions and a questionnaire with available literature. Suitable methods and strategies were selected resulting in an intervention including: eight weeks of customized mindfulness training, followed by eight sessions of e-coaching and supporting elements, such as providing fruit and snack vegetables at the workplace, lunch walking routes, and a buddy system. The effects of the intervention will be evaluated in a RCT, with measurements at baseline, six months (T1) and 12 months (T2). In addition, cost-effectiveness and process of the intervention will also be evaluated.Discussion: At baseline the level of work engagement of the sample was ""average"". Of the study population, 60.1% did not engage in vigorous physical activity at all. An average working day consists of eight sedentary hours. For the Phase II RCT, there were no significant differences between the intervention and the control group at baseline, except for vigorous physical activity. The baseline characteristics of the study population were congruent with the results of the needs assessment. The IM protocol used for the systematic development of the intervention produced an appropriate intervention to test in the planned RCT.","van Berkel, Jantien; Proper, Karin I.; Boot, Cecile R.

2094,"A randomized controlled trial of a self-guided, multimedia, stress management and resilience training program","Background: Stress is a common and costly behavioral health issue. Technology-based behavioral health programs (e.g., computer or web-based programs) are effective for treating anxiety or depression. These programs increase availability of evidence-based interventions to individuals who are not able or willing to receive such in-person treatments. Stress management training has empirical support, but little data exists on its efficacy with stressed but healthy individuals, and there are no prior studies employing a self-guided, multimedia intervention. We conducted a randomized controlled trial of a self-guided, multimedia stress management and resilience training program (SMART-OP) with a stressed but healthy sample. Methods: Participants (N = 66) were randomized to SMART-OP or an attention control (AC) group that received marketed videos and published material on stress management. Participants were evaluated on self-report measures and Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) performance. Analyses were based on study completers (N = 59). Results: SMART-OP group reported significantly less stress, more perceived control over stress, and rated SMART-OP as significantly more useful than AC. During the TSST, the data suggests the SMART-OP group showed greater within-task Î±-amylase recovery at post-assessment. Conclusions: SMART-OP is highly usable and is a more effective and useful stress management training program than an educational comparison.

2095,"Stress Management Interventions for HIV+ Adults: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials, 1989 to 2006","Objective: Numerous studies document that stress accelerates disease processes in a variety of diseases including HIV. As a result, investigators have developed and evaluated interventions to reduce stress as a means to improve health among persons living with HIV. Therefore, the current meta-analysis examines the impact of stress-management interventions at improving psychological, immunological, hormonal, and other behavioral health outcomes among HIV+ adults. Design: This meta-analytic review integrated the results of 35 randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of 46 separate stress-management interventions for HIV+ adults (N = 3,077). Main Outcome Measures: Effect sizes were calculated for stress processes (coping and social support), psychological/psychosocial (anxiety, depression, distress, and quality of life), immunological (CD4+ counts and viral load), hormonal (cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate [DHEA-S], cortisol/DHEA-S ratio, and testosterone) and other behavioral health outcomes (fatigue). Results: Compared to controls, stress-management interventions reduce anxiety, depression, distress, and fatigue and improve quality of life (d+s = 0.16 to 0.38). Stress-management interventions do not appear to improve CD4+ counts, viral load, or hormonal outcomes compared with controls. Conclusion: Overall, stress-management interventions for HIV+ adults significantly improve mental health and quality of life but do not alter immunological or hormonal processes. The absence of immunological or hormonal benefits may reflect the studies' limited assessment period (measured typically within 1-week postintervention), participants' advanced stage of HIV (HIV+ status known for an average of 5 years), and/or sample characteristics (predominately male and White participants).

2096,Piloting a stress management and mindfulness program for undergraduate nursing students: Student feedback and lessons learned,"Background: Widespread reports of high stress levels and mental health problems among university student populations indicate the use of interventions to facilitate stress reduction and support student resilience and wellbeing. There is growing evidence that regular mindfulness practice may confer positive health benefits and reduced stress levels. Objectives: The aim of this pilot project was to explore the impact of a seven-week stress management and mindfulness program as a learning support and stress reduction method for nursing and midwifery students. Setting: The program was conducted at a large regional university in Australia. Participants: Fourteen first-year undergraduate nursing and midwifery students agreed to attend the program and to participate in a follow-up focus group. Method and Design: A descriptive qualitative design was utilised to examine the impact of the program. A semi-structured focus group interview was conducted with a thematic analysis undertaken of the transcript and process notes. Results: Ten students completed the research component of this project by participating in the focus group interview. Three main themes capture the participants' experience: attending to self, attending to others and attending to program related challenges. Data indicate a positive impact on sleep, concentration, clarity of thought and a reduction in negative cognitions. Participants also identified challenges related to timetabling, program structure and venue. Conclusions: Overall, this pilot program enhanced the participants' sense of well-being. Despite the challenges, benefits were identified on a personal and professional level. Valuable feedback was provided that will be used to further develop and expand stress management and mindfulness programs offered to students attending this university.

2097,Sleep Quality and Fatigue after a Stress Management Intervention for Women with Early-Stage Breast Cancer in Southern Florida,"Purpose: This study examined secondary outcomes from a CBSM intervention trial for women with early-stage breast cancer to test if CBSM would improve sleep quality and fatigue among these patients at a single site in southern Florida. CBSM-related effects have already been demonstrated for indicators of psychosocial adaptation (e.g., general and cancer-related anxiety).Background: Sleep disruption and fatigue are ubiquitous among cancer patients and are sources of stress that may compromise treatment outcomes. Previously, we showed that a cognitive behavioral stress management (CBSM) intervention reduced anxiety and other stress-related processes in women undergoing primary treatment for breast cancer.Methods: Patients were randomized to CBSM (n= 120) or a 1-day psychoeducation control group (n= 120). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Fatigue Symptom Inventory were completed prior to randomization and 6 and 12Â months after the baseline assignment.Results: In latent growth analyses, women in CBSM reported greater improvements in PSQI sleep quality scores than controls, although there were no significant differences between conditions on PSQI total scores. Women in CBSM also reported greater reductions in fatigue-related daytime interference than controls, though there were no significant differences in changes in fatigue intensity. Changes in sleep quality were associated with changes in fatigue.Conclusions: Future work may consider integrating sleep and fatigue content into stress management interventions for women with early-stage breast cancer.

2098,Enhancement of antibody responses to influenza vaccination in the elderly following a cognitive-behavioural stress management intervention,"Background: Previous research has demonstrated that the psychological morbidity experienced by informal caregivers is associated with increased vulnerability to infectious diseases, in particular influenza. A pragmatic trial was conducted to examine whether a stress management intervention (SMI) could reduce psychological morbidity and enhance the antibody response to influenza vaccination in the elderly, and whether changes in immune response of SMI participants were associated with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Methods: Forty-three elderly spousal carers of dementia patients and 27 non-carer controls were recruited. Sixteen carers were allocated to an 8-week SMI or a non-intervention condition (n = 27). The non-carers formed a no treatment, 'normal' comparison group. At the end of the SMI or its equivalent time period, all participants received an influenza vaccination. IgG antibody titres to the vaccine were measured 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks post-vaccine. Results: There was evidence of elevated distress in both carer groups compared with non-carer controls throughout the SMI period, but no between-group differences in salivary cortisol. Immune responses to the vaccine revealed that 50% of SMI carers, 7% of non-intervention carers and 29% of non-carer controls produced a four-fold increase in antibody titre. Conclusions: The immune response to influenza vaccination appears amenable to improvement through stress management, although the mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear.

The purpose of this study was to explore exercise self-efficacy among university employees and the effects of a worksite wellness program on physical activity, cardio-respiratory fitness, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Methods: Participants included 121 university employees (85% female). The worksite wellness program included cardiovascular health assessments, personal health reports, 8 weeks of pedometer-based walking and tracking activities, and weekly wellness sessions. Daily step count was assessed at baseline, Week 4, and Week 8. Exercise self-efficacy and CVD risk factors were evaluated at baseline and follow-up. Results: Daily step count increased from 6566 Â± 258 (LSM Â± SE) at baseline to 8605 Â± 356 at Week 4 and 9107 Â± 388 at Week 8 (P < .0001). Steps increased among normal weight, overweight, and obese subgroups. Exercise self-efficacy correlated with baseline steps (P < .05). Small improvements were observed in cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides (all P < .01).

2106,"Improvements in Health Behaviors, Eating Self-Efficacy, and Goal-Setting Skills Following Participation in Wellness Coaching","Purpose: This project examined potential changes in health behaviors following wellness coaching.Design: In a single cohort study design, wellness coaching participants were recruited in 2011, data were collected through July 2012, and were analyzed through December 2013. Items in the study questionnaire used requested information about 11 health behaviors, self-efficacy for eating, and goalsetting skills.Setting: Worksite wellness center.Participants: One-hundred employee wellness center members with an average age of 42 years; 90% were female and most were overweight or obese.Intervention: Twelve weeks of in-person, one-on-one wellness coaching.Method: Participants completed study questionnaires when they started wellness coaching (baseline), after 12 weeks of wellness coaching, and at a 3-month follow-up.Results: From baseline to week 12, these 100 wellness coaching participants improved their self-reported health behaviors (11 domains, 0- to 10-point scale) from an average of 6.4 to 7.7 (p < .001), eating selfefficacy from an average of 112 to 142 (on a 0- to 180-point scale; p < .001), and goal-setting skills from an average of 49 to 55 (on a 16- to 80-point scale; p < .001).Conclusion: These results suggest that participants improved their current health behaviors and learned skills for continued healthy living. Future studies that use randomized controlled trials are needed to establish causality for wellness coaching.","Clark, Matthew M.; Bradley, Karleah L.; Jenkins, Sarah M.; Mettler, Emily A.; Larson, Brent G.; Preston, Heather R.; Liesinger, Juliette T.; Werneburg, Brooke L.; Hagen, Philip T.; Harris, Ann M.; Riley, Beth A.; Olsen, Kerry D.; Douglas, Kristin S.

2111,The key role of shared participation in changing occupational self-efficacy through stress management courses,"This study is the first that longitudinally examined change in occupational self-efficacy (OSE) through individual and shared participation in occupational stress management courses (SMC). Applying the framework of social cognitive theory (Bandura, 1986, Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall), we assumed that participation in SMC facilitates OSE perceptions. We further assumed that the psychosocial environment promotes change in OSE through high shared participation (reach) in SMC within work groups. Comparing participants and non-participants, we conducted growth analyses with three waves of data nested in n = 545 employees further nested in 97 work groups. The results showed that individual participation in SMC alone was insufficient to enhance OSE, a combination of individual and high shared participation being needed to significantly enhance OSE perceptions over a period of 2 years. The results are discussed with reference to specificity issues and the role of the psychosocial environment by applying social identity theory and the notion of shared mental models. We conclude by recommending SMC as a feasible intervention to enhance OSE in heterogeneous occupational contexts - if a majority of work group members can be involved.

2113,The power of presence: The role of mindfulness at work for daily levels and change trajectories of psychological detachment and sleep quality,"In this research, we examined the role of mindfulness for recovery from work using a daily diary design (N = 121; 5 days; 3 measurement occasions per day). The first goal of the study was to investigate the relationship of mindfulness with sleep quality and the mediating role of psychological detachment from a day-level perspective. A second goal was to extend the process perspective in recovery research beyond the day level and consider systematic change trajectories in recovery variables over the course of the work week and the role of mindfulness in these trajectories. Results regarding day-level relationships confirmed that mindfulness experienced during work was related to subsequent sleep quality, and this relationship was mediated by psychological detachment from work in the evening. Furthermore, an investigation of the role of mindfulness in recovery change trajectories supported the idea that psychological detachment trajectories increase over the work week for individuals low on mindfulness while there was no systematic mean-level change for individuals high on mindfulness. In contrast, sleep quality followed a linear increase from Monday to Friday for all individuals, irrespective of their levels of trait mindfulness. Practical and theoretical implications for the mindfulness and the recovery literature are discussed in conclusion.

2114,Effects of web-based stress and depression literacy intervention on improving work engagement among workers with low work engagement: An analysis of secondary outcome of a randomized controlled trial,"Objective: The purpose of this randomized, controlled trial was to examine the effects of a psychoeducational information website on improving work engagement among individual workers with low work engagement, where work engagement was measured as a secondary outcome. Methods: Participants were recruited from registered members of a web survey site in Japan. Participants who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were randomly allocated to intervention or control groups. Immediately after the baseline survey, the intervention group was invited to study a psychoeducational website called the ""UTSMed,"" which provided general mental health literacy and cognitive behavioral skills. Work engagement was assessed by using the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale at baseline, 1-, and 4-month follow-ups for both intervention and control groups. An exploratory analysis was conducted for a subgroup with low (lower than the median scores) work engagement scores at baseline. Results: A total of 1,236 workers completed the baseline survey. In the low work engagement subgroup, a total of 313 and 300 participants were allocated to an intervention and control group, respectively. In the high work engagement subgroup, 305 and 318 participants were allocated to an intervention and control group, respectively. The program showed a significant effect on work engagement (t = 1.98, P = 0.048) at the 4-month follow-up in the low work engagement subgroup, with a small effect size (d = 0.17). Conclusion: A web-based psychoeducation resource of mental health literacy and cognitive behavioral skills may be effective for improving work engagement among individual workers with low work engagement.","Imamura K., Kawakami N., Tsuno K., Tsuchiya M., Shimada K., Namba K., Shimazu A.",0,10.1539/joh.16-0187-OA,1628
2121,Does work-site physical activity improve self-reported psychosocial workplace factors and job satisfaction? A randomized controlled intervention study,"To investigate whether a work-site strength-training program has a positive effect on self-reported psychosocial workplace factors and job satisfaction.We conducted a randomized controlled trial among laboratory technicians implementing neck and shoulder exercises for pain relief, with 199 participants in the training group and 228 in the control group. Influence at work, sense of community, time pressure, and job satisfaction were measured with the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire at baseline and post-intervention after 20 weeks.There was no statistically significant change in any of the four variables in the training group from baseline to follow-up (all p a parts per thousand yen 0.39). When we used MANOVA to test for between-group effects over time, we did not find any statistically significant result (all p > 0.14).This study does not provide evidence for an effect of a work-site strength-training program on self-reported psychosocial workplace factors and job satisfaction.","Roessler, K.

2126,Building personal and professional resources of resilience and agility in the healthcare workplace,"This article describes the rationale, implementation and results of a pilot study evaluating the personal and organizational impact of an educational intervention on the stress of health team members. The compelling imperative for the project was to find a positive and effective way to address the documented stress levels of healthcare workers. Pilot study of oncology staff (n=29) and healthcare leaders (n=15) exploring the impact of a positive coping approach on Personal and Organizational Quality Assessment-Revised (POQA-R) scores at baseline and 7 months using paired t-tests. Personal and organizational indicators of stress decreased in the expected directions in both groups over the time intervals. The majority of POQA-R categories were statistically significantly improved in the oncology staff, and many of the categories were statistically significantly improved in the leadership group. The findings from this project demonstrate that stress and its symptoms are problematic issues for hospital and ambulatory clinic staff as evidenced by baseline measures of distress. Further, a workplace intervention was feasible and effective in promoting positive strategies for coping and enhancing well-being, personally and organizationally.

2127,The two sides of competition: Competition-induced effort and affect during intergroup versus interindividual competition,"Competition strongly affects individual effort and performance for both individuals and groups. Especially in work settings, these effort gains might come at the cost of individual well-being. The present study tested whether competition increases both effort (as indicated by task performance) and stress (in terms of cardiovascular reactivity and affective response), and whether this effect is further qualified by the type of competition (interindividual vs. intergroup), using a cognitive computer-based task and a 2 (Group: Yes, No) Ã— 2 (Competition: Yes, No) Ã— 2 (Gender) factorial design (N= 147). All participants either worked as a representative of a group or as an individual, and were offered performance-related incentives distributed in a lottery. In the competition conditions, participants were informed that they competed with someone else, and that only the winning person/team would take part in the lottery. Consistent with expectations, competition increased both individual effort and cardiovascular reactivity compared to non-competitive work. Moreover, for female participants, intergroup competition triggered increased effort and more positive affect than interindividual competition. Aside from documenting costly side-effects of competition in terms of stress, this study provides evidence for a stress-related explanation of effort gains during intergroup competition as compared to interindividual competition.

2128,Effects of a stress management intervention on absenteeism and return to work - results from a randomized wait-list controlled trial,"Objective High levels of work-related stress are associated with increased absenteeism from work and reduced work ability. In this study, we investigated the effects of a stress management intervention on absenteeism and return to work. Methods We randomized 102 participants into either the intervention or wait-list control (WLC) group. The intervention group received the intervention in weeks 1-16 from baseline, and the WLC group received the intervention in weeks 17-32. Self-reported data on absenteeism (number of days full- or part-time absent from work within the previous three months) were obtained at 16, 32, and 48 weeks follow-up. Register-based data on long-term absence from work were drawn from the Danish public transfer payments (DREAM) database from baseline and 48 weeks onwards. The DREAM database contains weekly information on long-term sickness absence compensation. The threshold to enter DREAM is sick leave for two consecutive weeks. Results At follow-up in week 16, self-reported absenteeism in the intervention group [median 11 days (range 3-25)] was lower (P=0.02) than in the WLC group [median 45 days (range 19-60)], corresponding to a 29% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 5-52] reduction. On register-based data (cumulated weeks in DREAM, weeks 1-16), the intervention group median [6 weeks (range 0-11)] was lower than that of the WLC group [median 12 weeks (range 8-16)], though not significantly (P=0.06), corresponding to a 21% (95% CI 0-42) reduction. For return to work, a hazard ratio of 1.58 (95% CI 0.89-2.81) favoring the intervention group was found (P=0.12). Conclusions The intervention reduces self-reported absenteeism from work. A similar trend was found from register-based records. No conclusive evidence was found for return to work.","Willert M.V., Thulstrup A.M., Bonde J.P.",0,10.5271/sjweh.3130,1632
2129,"Design of the Bottom-up Innovation project - A participatory, Primary preventive, Organizational level intervention on work-related stress and well-being for workers in dutch vocational education","Background: In the educational sector job demands have intensified, while job resources remained the same. A prolonged disbalance between demands and resources contributes to lowered vitality and heightened need for recovery, eventually resulting in burnout, sickness absence and retention problems. Until now stress management interventions in education focused mostly on strengthening the individual capacity to cope with stress, instead of altering the sources of stress at work at the organizational level. These interventions have been only partly effective in influencing burnout and well-being. Therefore, the ""Bottom-up Innovation"" project tests a two-phased participatory, primary preventive organizational level intervention (i.e. a participatory action approach) that targets and engages all workers in the primary process of schools. It is hypothesized that participating in the project results in increased occupational self-efficacy and organizational efficacy. The central research question: is an organization focused stress management intervention based on participatory action effective in reducing the need for recovery and enhancing vitality in school employees in comparison to business as usual?. Methods/Design. The study is designed as a controlled trial with mixed methods and three measurement moments: baseline (quantitative measures), six months and 18 months (quantitative and qualitative measures). At first follow-up short term effects of taking part in the needs assessment (phase 1) will be determined. At second follow-up the long term effects of taking part in the needs assessment will be determined as well as the effects of implemented tailored workplace solutions (phase 2). A process evaluation based on quantitative and qualitative data will shed light on whether, how and why the intervention (does not) work(s). Discussion. ""Bottom-up Innovation"" is a combined effort of the educational sector, intervention providers and researchers. Results will provide insight into (1) the relation between participating in the intervention and occupational and organizational self-efficacy, (2) how an improved balance between job demands and job resources might affect need for recovery and vitality, in the short and long term, from an organizational perspective, and (3) success and fail factors for implementation of an organizational intervention.

2130,Employee wellness management programme as a strategy for transforming the public service â€“ a case of the department of agriculture in limpopo province of south africa,"Public service transformation has been at the heart of government since 1994. Therefore, to ensure that transformation takes place at different government departments, a number of programmes were introduced. One of such programmes is Employee Health and Wellness programme. The main focus of this programme is to bring about changes in the wellbeing and the working environment in the departments so that service delivery, employeesâ€™ health and productivity can be accelerated and improved. Thus, the Limpopo Department of Agriculture started the implementation of an Employee Health and Wellness program in 2001 in response to the government mandate which was brought about by the birth of new democracy. Since every important programme has to be evaluated, therefore this article reports on the evaluation that was conducted on the success of wellness programmes in combating absenteeism in the Limpopo Department of Agriculture. Absenteeism in most government departments is a serious problem that negatively affects the delivery of services. There are many cases of absenteeism which have varied causes. However, the focus of this article is on the effectiveness of wellness management programme on combating absenteeism, and addressing the challenges of absenteeism due to substance abuse in the public service. The findings indicated that absenteeism negatively affects service delivery in the public sector and that participants on these programmes are offered limited support by their supervisors. Supervisors tend to show negative tendencies towards the wellness management participants who show little progress in recovery. This article therefore recommends that wellness programmes have to be fully supported by the management of various organizations so that they can be successful. Departments should also develop strategies that can curb substance abuse amongst the employees. Â© 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

2131,Factors associated with high use of a workplace web-based stress management program in a randomized controlled intervention study,"In web-based health promotion programs, large variations in participant engagement are common. The aim was to investigate determinants of high use of a worksite self-help web-based program for stress management. Two versions of the program were offered to randomly selected departments in IT and media companies. A static version of the program including health screening tool, diary and information about stress was offered to the control group. Additional materials, i.e. interactive, cognitive-based and classical stress management exercises and a chat room, were offered to the intervention group. Baseline data regarding participants' demographics, health (self-ratings and biological measures), lifestyle, work-related factors and group membership were analyzed to study determinants of employees' participation in the program during a period of 12 months. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used and found intervention group membership, being a woman, having at most a secondary education, regular physical exercise habits and having positive expectations of the program were significant predictors of high use. The findings demonstrate that the interactivity of a web-based program is an important factor for determining participation in a web-based worksite stress management program. Implications for those developing and implementing future web-based health promotion activities are discussed. Â© The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.

2132,An evaluation of the choices for well-being project,"The relationship between mental health, self-esteem and unemployment is well established. Emerging research suggests that interventions such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can counter the negative effects of unemployment and may improve re-employment. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a manual-based programme, which combines CBT with job skills training, in improving the psychological health and job- seeking skills of unemployed individuals within the UK. One hundred and nine unemployed individuals, suffering mild to moderate mental health problems, were referred to the programme. Of these, 47 completed the programme and 32 attended follow-up. The impact of the manualised course was evaluated using a randomised control trial with a waiting list control. On completion of the programme, participants showed improvements in mental health, self- esteem and job-search self-efficacy as well as a reduction in the occurrence of negative automatic thoughts. Twenty participants gained employment and improvements persisted at follow-up. Considering the initial levels of psychological distress and mental health problems among the unemployed sample, the need for adequate service provision for the unemployed is recommended.

2133,Treatment-as-usual (TAU) is anything but usual: A meta-analysis of CBT versus TAU for anxiety and depression,"Objectives There were three aims of this study, the first was to examine the efficacy of CBT versus treatment-as-usual (TAU) in the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders, the second was to examine how TAU is defined in TAU control groups for those disorders, and the third was to explore whether the type of TAU condition influences the estimate of effects of CBT. Method A systematic search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and CINAHL was conducted. Results 48 studies of CBT for depressive or anxiety disorders (n=6926) that specified that their control group received TAU were identified. Most (n=45/48) provided an explanation of the TAU group however there was significant heterogeneity amongst TAU conditions. The meta-analysis showed medium effects favoring CBT over TAU for both anxiety (g=0.69, 95% CI 0.47-0.92, p<0.001, n=1318) and depression (g=0.70, 95% CI 0.49-0.90, p<0.001, n=5054), with differential effects observed across TAU conditions. Conclusions CBT is superior to TAU and the size of the effect of CBT compared to TAU depends on the nature of the TAU condition. The term TAU is used in different ways and should be more precisely described. The four key details to be reported can be thought of as ""who, what, how many, and any additional treatments?""

2136,"""Here we're all in the same boat"" - A qualitative study of group based rehabilitation for sick-listed citizens with chronic pain","Musculoskeletal pain impacts upon everyday life. A degree of chronicity may pose an increased risk of sickness absence. One of two rehabilitative interventions, ""Tailored Physical Activity"" or ""Chronic Pain Self-Management Program"", was offered to sick-listed citizens who experienced pain. The objectives of this paper were to: (1) Assess what factors are experienced as problematic for sick-listed citizens in everyday life with chronic pain, and (2) Evaluate the significance of two distinct rehabilitative interventions on the future everyday lives of sick-listed citizens. Seven semi-structured interviews with sick-listed citizens were analyzed using a phenomenological-hermeneutical approach. Results were discussed by applying the theoretical framework of Antonovsky's salutogenetic model and Yaloms principles for group psychology. The potential for development of citizen's coping is evaluated based on Roessler's notion of progression. The analysis revealed four main themes: (1) Living with pain and unemployment; (2) ""Putting my foot down"" and ""asking for help"" (3) Significance of the group, including instructors, and (4) Aspects significant to progression. Unemployment is a major life event that promotes stress and can be accompanied by problems related to depressed mood, acceptance of the life situation, feelings of not being useful, feelings of losing control and identity conflicts. Group characteristics that gave a significant basis for progression in the self-management program are both emotional and instrumental, while the physical training program offers a ""here-and-now""-experience and motivation to participate. This study indicates that the self-management program could potentially improve coping while the physical activity program revealed one example of a means of progression.

2137,Effect of brief daily exercise on headache among adults - secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial,"Objective This paper investigates secondary outcomes (headache) in a randomized controlled trial with physical exercise among office workers with neck/shoulder pain.Methods A total of 198 office workers with frequent neck/shoulder pain were randomly allocated to either one of two intervention groups (10 weeks of resistance training with elastic tubing for 2 or 12 minutes per day, 5 times a week) or the control group, which received weekly health information. Secondary outcomes included changes in frequency, intensity, and duration of headache after ten weeks.Results Compared with the control group, headache frequency decreased in the 2- and 12-minute intervention groups [0.64 days/week (95% confidence interval [95% CI]) 0.23-1.0) and 0.79 days/week (95% CI 0.37-1.2), corresponding to a 43% and 56% decrease from baseline, respectively]. Intensity and duration of the remaining headaches were unaffected.Conclusions Two minutes of daily resistance training for ten weeks reduces headache frequency among office workers with neck/shoulder pain. The vast number of adult workers suffering from one or two days of weekly headaches and who could potentially comply with and benefit from brief exercise programs stresses the applicability of our findings.","Andersen, Lars L.; Mortensen, Ole S.; Zebis, Mette K.; Jensen, Rigmor H.; Poulsen, Otto M.",0,10.5271/sjweh.3170,1641
2138,Interventions to facilitate return to work in adults with adjustment disorders,"BackgroundAdjustment disorders are a frequent cause of sick leave and various interventions have been developed to expedite the return to work (RTW) of individuals on sick leave due to adjustment disorders.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of interventions facilitating RTW for workers with acute or chronic adjustment disorders.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR) to October 2011; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to Issue 4, 2011; MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and ISI Web of Science, all years to February 2011; the WHO trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov in March 2011. We also screened reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews.Selection criteriaWe selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to facilitate RTW of workers with adjustment disorders compared to no or other treatment. Eligible interventions were pharmacological interventions, psychological interventions (such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and problem solving therapy), relaxation techniques, exercise programmes, employee assistance programmes or combinations of these interventions. The primary outcomes were time to partial and time to full RTW, and secondary outcomes were severity of symptoms of adjustment disorder, work functioning, generic functional status (i.e. the overall functional capabilities of an individual, such as physical functioning, social function, general mental health) and quality of life.Data collection and analysisTwo authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We pooled studies that we deemed sufficiently clinically homogeneous in different comparison groups, and assessed the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Main resultsWe included nine studies reporting on 10 psychological interventions and one combined intervention. The studies included 1546 participants. No RCTs were found of pharmacological interventions, exercise programmes or employee assistance programmes. We assessed seven studies as having low risk of bias and the studies that were pooled together were comparable. For those who received no treatment, compared with CBT, the assumed time to partial and full RTW was 88 and 252 days respectively. Based on two studies with a total of 159 participants, moderate-quality evidence showed that CBT had similar results for time (measured in days) until partial RTW compared to no treatment at one-year follow-up (mean difference (MD) -8.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) -23.26 to 5.71). We found low-quality evidence of similar results for CBT and no treatment on the reduction of days until full RTW at one-year follow-up (MD -35.73, 95% CI -113.15 to 41.69) (one study with 105 participants included in the analysis). Based on moderate-quality evidence, problem solving therapy (PST) significantly reduced time until partial RTW at one-year follow-up compared to non-guideline based care (MD -17.00, 95% CI -26.48 to -7.52) (one study with 192 participants clustered among 33 treatment providers included in the analysis), but we found moderate-quality evidence of no significant effect on reducing days until full RTW at one-year follow-up (MD -17.73, 95% CI -37.35 to 1.90) (two studies with 342 participants included in the analysis).Authors' conclusionsWe found moderate-quality evidence that CBT did not significantly reduce time until partial RTW and low-quality evidence that it did not significantly reduce time to full RTW compared with no treatment. Moderate-quality evidence showed that PST significantly enhanced partial RTW at one-year follow-up compared to non-guideline based care but did not significantly enhance time to full RTW at one-year follow-up. An important limitation was the small number of studies included in the meta-analyses and the small number of participants, which lowered the power of the analyses.","Arends, Iris; Bruinvels, David J.; Rebergen, David S.; Nieuwenhuijsen, Karen; Madan, Ira; Neumeyer-Gromen, Angela; Bultmann, Ute; Verbeek, Jos H.",0,10.1002/14651858.CD006389.pub2,1642
2139,"Subtypes in clinical burnout patients enrolled in an employee rehabilitation program: differences in burnout profiles, depression, and recovery/resources-stress balance","Background: Burnout is generally perceived a unified disorder with homogeneous symptomatology across people (exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy). However, increasing evidence points to intra-individual patterns of burnout symptoms in non-clinical samples such as students, athletes, healthy, and burned-out employees. Different burnout subtypes might therefore exist. Yet, burnout subtypes based on burnout profiles have hardly been explored in clinical patients, and the samples investigated in previous studies were rather heterogeneous including patients with various physical, psychological, and social limitations, symptoms, and disabilities. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore burnout subtypes based on burnout profiles in clinically diagnosed burnout patients enrolled in an employee rehabilitation program, and to investigate whether the subtypes differ in depression, recovery/resourcesstress balance, and sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: One hundred three patients (66 women, 37 men) with a clinical burnout diagnosis, who were enrolled in a 5 week employee rehabilitation program in two specialized psychosomatic clinics in Austria, completed a series of questionnaires including the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS), the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Recovery-Stress-Questionnaire for Work. Cluster analyses with the three MBI-GS subscales as clustering variables were used to identify the burnout subtypes. Subsequent multivariate/univariate analysis of variance and Pearson chi-square tests were performed to investigate differences in depression, recovery/resources-stress balance, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Three different burnout subtypes were discovered: the exhausted subtype, the exhausted/cynical subtype, and the burned-out subtype. The burned-out subtype and the exhausted/cynical subtype showed both more severe depression symptoms and a worse recovery/resources-stress balance than the exhausted subtype. Furthermore, the burned-out subtype was more depressed than the exhausted/cynical subtype, but no difference was observed between these two subtypes with regard to perceived stress, recovery, and resources. Sociodemographic characteristics were not associated with the subtypes. Conclusions: The present study indicates that there are different subtypes in clinical burnout patients (exhausted, exhausted/cynical, and burned-out), which might represent patients at different developmental stages in the burnout cycle. Future studies need to replicate the current findings, investigate the stability of the symptom patterns, and examine the efficacy of rehabilitation interventions in different subtypes.","Bauernhofer, K; Bassa, D; Canazei, M; Jimenez, P; Paechter, M; Papousek, I; Fink, A; Weiss, EM",0,10.1186/s12888-018-1589-y,1643
2140,Reducing primary and secondary traumatic stress symptoms among Educators by Training Them to Deliver a Resiliency Program (ERASE-Stress) following the christchurch earthquake in New Zealand,"The current investigation evaluated the impact of a universal school-based resiliency intervention (ERASE-Stress) on educators who were working with elementary schoolchildren exposed to the Canterbury earthquake in New Zealand. In the context of major disasters, educators may suffer from ""dual trauma""; they can experience symptoms of both primary trauma (as a result of the disaster itself) and secondary trauma (as a result of working with traumatized students). Sixty-three educators were randomly assigned to either the ERASE-Stress intervention or an alternative Managing Emergencies and Traumatic Incidents (METI) program which served as a control group. Efficacy of the program was evaluated at the end of the training as well as at 8 months follow-up. Compared with educators in the control group, those in the ERASE-Stress intervention significantly reduced their posttraumatic distress and secondary traumatization symptoms, improved their perceived level of professional self-efficacy as a helper of earthquake survivors, developed an optimistic outlook regarding their personal future and enhanced their sense of hope, and honed some of their positive coping strategies and reduced the utilization of some maladaptive coping methods. These beneficial consequences of the ERASE-Stress training make it a potentially useful tool for educators working with traumatized students in the context of major disasters.

2141,The influence of occupational debriefing on post-traumatic stress symptomatology in traumatized police officers,"Certain individuals, such as police officers, are exposed to traumatic events as part of their occupational roles. In an effort to prevent psychological illnesses, notably the post-traumatic stress disorder, from arising out of work-related traumatic incidents, psychological interventions have been developed such as Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (Mitchell, 1983; Mitchell & Everly, 1996). The present study tests the hypothesis that debriefing reduces the psychological morbidity caused by work-related incidents. Because debriefing techniques were not designed for application on a 'one-off' basis (Robinson & Mitchell, 1933), the procedure studied here consisted of three successive debriefing sessions (at 24 hours, 1 month and 3 months post-trauma), which included traumatic stress education. In a sample of 243 traumatized police officers, a subgroup of debriefed officers (N = 86) was compared with non-debriefed internal (N = 82) and external (N = 75) control groups. No differences in psychological morbidity were found between the groups at pre-test, at 24 hours or at 6 months post-trauma. One week post-trauma, debriefed subjects exhibited significantly more post-traumatic stress disorder symptomatology than non-debriefed subjects. High levels of satisfaction with debriefing were not reflect ed in positive outcomes. The findings are translated into recommendations for the future use of debriefing in police practice.","Carlier, IVE; Voerman, AE; Gersons, BPR",0,10.1348/000711200160327,1645
2142,Changes in self-reported sleep and cognitive failures: A randomized controlled trial of a stress management intervention,"Objectives This study evaluated the effectiveness of a stress management intervention combining individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with a brief workplace intervention on self-reported measures of sleep and cognitive functioning among patients on sick leave due to work-related stress complaints. Methods Participants were patients referred to the regional Department of Occupational Medicine. Inclusion criteria were (i) sick leave due to work-related stress complaints and (ii) a diagnosis of adjustment disorder/reactions to stress or mild depression. Participants (N=137) were randomized to either an intervention (N=57) or control (N=80) group. The intervention comprised six sessions with a psychologist and the offer of a small workplace intervention. Questionnaires were answered at baseline and after 4, and 10 months. Results Symptoms were significantly reduced over time in both groups but there was no significant treatment effect on sleep or cognitive outcomes at any time point. From 0-4 months, there was a tendency for larger improvements in the intervention group with regards to sleep and cognitive failures in distraction. Although neither was significant, the results came close to significance depicting a small effect size (Cohenâ€™s d) on sleep complaints and distractions (but not memory). Conclusions The specific intervention was not superior to the control condition in reducing symptoms of sleep problems and cognitive difficulties at any time point during the 10-month follow-up period. Substantial improvements in symptoms over time were seen in both groups.

2143,Return to work after work-related stress: A randomized controlled trial of a work-focused cognitive behavioral intervention,"Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a stress management intervention (SMI) on lasting return to work (RTW) among patients with work-related stress complaints. Methods Sickness benefit departments from three local municipalities referred patients on sick leave with work-related adjustment disorders or mild depression to the Department of Occupational Medicine, Regional Hospital West Jutland. A 2Ã— randomization procedure allocated patients into one of three groups: intervention (N=58), control A (which received a clinical assessment; N=56), or control B (no assessment; N=49). Treatment comprised individual work-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with an optional workplace intervention. The outcome was time until lasting RTW (16 and 44 weeks follow-up) using register data. Results Median number of weeks until lasting RTW was 15, 19, and 32 for the intervention group, control A, and control B respectively. However, for group B, clinical assessment was not part of the inclusion process, which may have introduced selection bias. In the fully-adjusted Cox regression model, the intervention group exhibited significantly faster lasting RTW at 44 weeks; hazard ratio (HR) 1.57 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.01-2.44] relative to control group A, with a non-significant trend evident at 16 weeks; HR 1.70 (95% CI 0.94-3.10), when controlling for age, gender, occupation, sick leave during previous year, full or partial sick leave, and diagnosis. Unadjusted analyses remained directionally consistent but were reduced to marginal significance. Conclusions There was a tendency towards faster lasting RTW in the intervention group compared to control A, which received clinical assessment, in all analyses. The intervention group returned to work about 4 weeks earlier than control A, which could translate into substantial financial gains.

In a pilot study the authors evaluated the potential of MBSR for stress management. Workers participated in an MBSR training for stress-related problems (treatment, n = 12) or waited for such a course (control, n = 11). The authors conducted interviews and measured coping and well-being. Qualitative interviews indicated that subjects had attained more awareness of work-related problems contributing to stress and had grown more critical toward their work environment. In the treatment group, positive strategies of coping with stress increased and negative strategies of coping decreased (significant difference at post treatment: p =.039 compared to control).

2146,A Randomized Controlled Trial of Supported Employment Among Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a potentially disabling mental illness that can cause occupational dysfunction. Although vocational rehabilitation is often prescribed for patients with PTSD, standard vocational services are far from adequate in helping them obtain and maintain competitive employment. This study is the first to examine the outcome of evidence-based supported employment for veterans with PTSD. Methods: Unemployed veterans with PTSD were randomly assigned to either individual placement and support (IFS) supported employment (N=42) or a Veterans Health Administration Vocational Rehabilitation Program (VRP) treatment as usual (N=43). Employment rates and occupational outcomes were followed for 12 months. Results: During the 12-month study, 76% of the IFS participants gained competitive employment, compared with 28% of the VRP participants (number needed to treat=2.07; chi(2)=19.84, df=1, p<.001). Veterans assigned to IPS also worked substantially more weeks than those assigned to VRP (42% versus 16% of the eligible weeks, respectively; Mann-Whitney z test p<.001) and earned higher 12-month income (meant+/-SD income of $9,264+/-$13,294 for IFS versus $2,601+/-$6,009 for VRP; Mann-Whitney z test p<.001) during the 12-month period. Conclusions: Veterans with PTSD who received IPS were 2.7 times more likely to gain competitive employment than those who received VRP. Because work is central to recovery, these results should assist stakeholders in planning improved services for veterans with PTSD.

2147,Individual and Group Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Work-Related Stress Complaints and Sickness Absence: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Work-related stress is widespread and can lead to long-term absenteeism and work disability. Cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) has demonstrated effectiveness in treating psychopathology but has only rarely been tested in clinical samples with work-related stress. A randomized controlled trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy of CBT-based stress management training (SMT). Eighty-two patients on sickness leave with work-related stress were randomly assigned to (a) individual SMT, (b) group SMT, or (c) care as usual (CAU). The SMT comprised 12 sessions conducted by a psychologist. Complaints of burnout and distress were measured at baseline, and at 4, 7, and 10 months. Absenteeism was measured during the whole research period. Across treatment conditions, complaints and sickness absence reduced considerably between baseline and 4 months. Thereafter, complaints remained approximately stable, whereas sickness absence further reduced. Hardly any significant group difference emerged, and no consistent pattern could be discerned in favor of any treatment condition. In subgroups with low depressive complaints, though, individual SMT resulted in larger reductions of some complaints than CAU. In conclusion, this study adds to the evidence that CBT-based interventions as currently practiced are not successful in treating patients with clinical levels of work-related stress.

2148,"Return to work after sick leave due to depression; A conceptual analysis based on perspectives of patients, supervisors and occupational physicians","Objectives: This study aims to investigate the most important factors facilitating a return to work after sick leave due to depression from the perspectives of patients, supervisors and occupational physicians.Methods: Concept mapping was used to develop a conceptual framework. Using purposive sampling, 32 participants representing Employees, supervisors and occupational physicians, were asked to formulate statements on what enables patients with sick leave due to depression to return to work. A total of 41 participants rated and grouped the statements. Data were analyzed using the statistical program Ariadne.Results: The concept mapping yielded 60 statements that consisted of promoting factors for return to work. Based on these statements, three meta-clusters and eight clusters were identified. The three meta-clusters consisted of work-related, person-related and healthcarerelated clusters. The work-related meta-cluster comprised of ""Adaptation of work"", ""Understanding and support in the workplace"" and ""Positive work experiences"". The personrelated meta-cluster encompassed ""Positive and valid self-perception"", ""Competence in self management"", ""Positive level of energy"", and ""Balanced home/work environment"". The healthcare-related meta-cluster was composed of ""Supportive healthcare"". Stakeholder groups differ in opinion, in what they see as most important for return to work.Limitations: The low number of participants and the high educational level of participants are a limitation for generalization of the findings.Conclusions: The study generated different statements that stakeholders consider important for return to work after sick leave due to depression. These findings can be used as a checklist for coordination of the return to work process. Differences in opinion regarding what stakeholders see as most important for return to work should receive special consideration during the reintegration process.

2151,Return to Work Outcomes of the Redesigning Daily Occupations (ReDO) Program for Women with Stress-Related Disorders-A Comparative Study,"Stress-related disorders are a frequent cause for sick leave, with consequences such as great distress and adverse economic effects for the affected person and substantial costs for society. Identifying effective interventions that facilitate return to work is thus important. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the 16-week Redesigning Daily Occupations program as a work rehabilitation method for Swedish women with stress-related disorders. The authors of this study hypothesized that, compared to women who got Care as Usual, 12 months after completed rehabilitation a larger proportion of the Redesigning Daily Occupations women would have returned to work, and they would have less sick leave, perceive less stress, and have greater self-esteem. Forty-two women entered the Redesigning Daily Occupations intervention and a matched comparison group received Care as Usual. The data, collected between 2007 and 2010, consisted of registry information and questionnaires targeting socio-demographics, perceived stress, and self-esteem. The findings partly verified the hypotheses. A larger proportion of the Redesigning Daily Occupations women returned to work and they decreased their sick leave and increased their self-esteem more than the Care as Usual group, but the groups did not differ in stress reduction. Thus, the Redesigning Daily Occupations seems to be a promising work rehabilitation method for women with stress-related disorders.

2152,Work outcomes and their predictors in the Redesigning Daily Occupations (ReDO) rehabilitation programme for women with stress-related disorders,"Previous research has shown that the Redesigning Daily Occupations programme reduced the degree of sick leave and increased return to work rates among women on sick leave for stress-related disorders when compared with ""care as usual"". To further investigate the Redesigning Daily Occupations intervention, this study explored changes in the work situation from baseline to a 12-month follow-up in the Redesigning Daily Occupations group compared with the ""care as usual"" group and analysed any predictors of change. Methods: A matched-control design was used and 84 women were recruited. Objective (return to work and sick leave) and subjective work outcomes (perceptions of the worker role and the work environment) were explored. Potential predictors were clinical and demographic variables and an anxiety-depression factor. Results: In both groups, large positive effect sizes from baseline to follow-up were found regarding the objective outcomes, a moderate positive effect size was found for perceived work environment, whereas perceived worker role remained unaffected. Previous work rehabilitation predicted objective work outcomes in both groups. Higher education and older age were predictors of subjective outcomes in the Redesigning Daily Occupations group, whereas a more severe anxiety-depression rating was negative for work environment ratings in the ""care as usual"" group. Conclusions: Return to work seemed possible without a change in the women's perceptions of the worker role; rather they renegotiated their view of the work environment. The Redesigning Daily Occupations programme was found to be promising, with a positive effect on return to work and sick leave reduction. It seemed more suitable for the higher educated and older women.

2153,"Minor long-term effects 3-4 years after the ReDO T intervention for women with stress-related disorders: A focus on sick leave rate, everyday occupations and well-being","BACKGROUND: The Redesigning Daily Occupations (ReDO (TM)) work rehabilitation method has been found effective, compared with care as usual (CAU), for women with stress-related disorders.OBJECTIVE: To conduct a long-term follow-up of former ReDO (TM) and CAU participants with respect to sick leave, well-being and everyday occupations 3-4 years after completed work rehabilitation.METHODS: Forty-two women in each group participated. An index day was decided to estimate sick-leave rate, retrieved from register data. Fifty-five women also participated in a telephone interview addressing well-being, everyday occupations and life events.RESULTS: Both groups had reduced their sick-leave rate further, but no difference between the groups was established. The ReDO (TM) women perceived a better balance in the work domain of everyday occupations, whereas the CAU group reported more over-occupation. No differences were found on well-being. The groups had experienced similar important life events, affecting the women's work and private lives. Previous stress and anxiety predicted sick leave at the long-term follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Although theReDO (TM) intervention had speeded up return towork in the immediate follow-up perspective, the CAU had caught up in the longer term.

It was hypothesised that, compared to women who got Care as Usual (CAU), the ReDO group would improve their quality of life and self-mastery more, and that those differences would prevail at follow-ups after 6 and 12 months. Another hypothesis was that the ReDO group would be more satisfied than the CAU group with the rehabilitation received.PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two women were recruited to the ReDO intervention and a matched comparison group got CAU.METHODS: The data consisted of self-ratings of quality of life, self-mastery and satisfaction with the work rehabilitation received.RESULTS: The first hypothesis was only partially verified. No general group differences were identified, but closer examination indicated different trajectories in the two groups. There was an increase in quality of life in the ReDO group from baseline to completion of the work rehabilitation, and further increase at the six-month follow-up, while the quality of life in the CAU group was stable over time. Regarding self-mastery there was an increase from baseline to completed rehabilitation in the ReDO group but a pronounced decrease in the CAU group. Thereafter the group differences levelled out. The second hypothesis was verified. The ratings of client satisfaction were considerably higher in the ReDO group.CONCLUSION: The ReDO seems a promising work rehabilitation method for strengthening quality of life and self-mastery for the target group.

Patients were living in the Stockholm metropolitan area, Sweden, were aged 18-65 years and were on 50%-100% sick leave. A group treatment for 20 weeks, three hours per week, with homework four hours per week. HRQoL was measured by the SWED-QUAL questionnaire, comprising 67 items grouped into 13 subscales, each with a separate index, and scores from 0 (worse) to 100 (best). SWED-QUAL covers aspects of physical and emotional well-being, cognitive function, sleep, general health and social and sexual functioning. Statistics: Wilcoxon's rank sum and Wilcoxon's sign rank tests, Bonett-Price for medians and confidence intervals, and Cohen's D.Results: Twenty-six patients in the TY (21 women), and 27 patients in both the MBCT (24 women) and in the CBT (25 women), were analyzed. Ten subscales in TY and seven subscales in MBCT and CBT showed improvements, p < 0.05, in several of the main domains affected in burnout, e.g. emotional well-being, physical well-being, cognitive function and sleep. The median improvement ranged from 0 to 27 points in TY, from 4 to 25 points in CBT and from 0 to 25 points in MBCT. The effect size was mainly medium or large. Comparison of treatments showed no statistical differences, but better effect (small) of both TY and MBCT compared to CBT. When comparing the effect of TY and MBCT, both showed a better effect (small) in two subscales each.Conclusions: A 20 week group treatment with TY, CBT or MBCT had equal effects on HRQoL, and particularly on main domains affected in burnout. This indicates that TY, MBCT and CBT can be used as both treatment and prevention, to improve HRQoL in patients on sick leave because of burnout, reducing the risk of future morbidity.","Grensman, Astrid; Acharya, Bikash Dev; Wandell, Per; Nilsson, Gunnar H.; Falkenberg, Torkel; Sundin, Orjan; Werner, Sigbritt",0,10.1186/s12906-018-2141-9,1659

Methods: The study design was quasi-experimental. All participants received a standard individual treatment for stress at a company healthcare unit. Half of the sample was also enrolled in a group intervention aimed at coping with psychological/somatic symptoms of stress. Data were collected before and after treatment and at 6- and 12-month follow-ups, through questionnaires and blood sampling. Rates of return to work were assessed for up to 5 years. Results: Levels of depression decreased in both conditions and these improvements were maintained at follow-up. The experimental condition was superior in alleviating burnout, as measured with the Karolinska Exhaustion Scale. Paradoxically, these improvements were accompanied by significant increases in levels of glycated haemoglobin in both groups. At 5-year follow-up 40% of participants in both conditions had returned to work. Conclusion: The stress management intervention seems to have beneficial effects on self-rated symptoms, but is comparable to treatment as usual with respect to rates of return to work.

2159,A controlled trial of an educational pamphlet to prevent disability after occupational low back injury,"Study Design. Randomized controlled trial.Objective. To test the ability of an educational pamphlet to improve recovery in terms of pain, work status, and health care utilization after occupational low back injury.Background. Low back pain and disability persist as occupational health problems of epidemic proportions. Because interventions based on biomechanical models have had limited impact, recent educational approaches to preventing back problems have stressed psychosocial recovery issues.Methods. A pamphlet was developed by compiling activity resumption, self-care, and attitudinal advice from recent publications. The pamphlet was sent at random to half of all consenting workers reporting back pain within 11 days of occupational injury between 7/96 and 6/97. Three and 6 months later, back pain, work status, health care use, and pamphlet impact outcomes were assessed through structured telephone interviews.Results. Of the 726 eligible workers, 486 consented to participate, Consenters and nonconsenters and intervention and control groups were similar in initial demographic variables; The pamphlet had no statistically significant impact at the 0.05 significance level on pain severity or reduction, health care visits, or work absence. Of the 229 pamphlet recipients, 129 thought it had provided useful information, but only 25 thought it had helped them return to work more quickly.Conclusions. In this trial, a pamphlet stressing psychosocial recovery issues did not prevent or reduce postinjury pain, health care use, or work absence.","Hazard, RG; Reid, S; Haugh, LD; McFarlane, G",0,10.1097/00007632-200006010-00015,1661
2160,Intervention Characteristics that Facilitate Return to Work After Sickness Absence: A Systematic Literature Review,"Introduction In many Western countries, a vast amount of interventions exist that aim to facilitate return to work (RTW) after sickness absence. These interventions are usually focused on specific target populations such as employees with low back pain, stress-related complaints or adjustment disorders. The aim of the present study is to detect and identify characteristics of RTW interventions that generally facilitate return to work (i.e. in multiple target populations and across interventions). This type of knowledge is highly relevant to policy makers and health practitioners who want to deliver evidence based care that supports the employee's health and participation in labour. Methods We performed a keyword search (systematic literature review) in seven databases (period: 1994-2010). In total, 23 articles were included and assessed for their methodological quality. The characteristics of the interventions were evaluated as well. Results Early interventions, initiated in the first 6 weeks of the RTW process were scarce. These were effective to support RTW though. Multidisciplinary interventions appeared effective to support RTW in multiple target groups (e.g. back pain and adjustment disorders). Time contingent interventions in which activities followed a pre-defined schedule were effective in all physical complaints studied in this review. Activating interventions such as gradual RTW were effective in physical complaints. They have not been studied for people with psychological complaints. Conclusions Early- and multidisciplinary intervention and time-contingent-, activating interventions appear most effective to support RTW.","Hoefsmit, Nicole; Houkes, Inge; Nijhuis, Frans J.

2161,"A low-dose mindfulness intervention and recovery from work: Effects on psychological detachment, sleep quality, and sleep duration","Although playing a crucial role for the prevention of long-term health impairment, interventions aiming at the improvement of employees' recovery processes are still scarce. In this study, we therefore investigated the effectiveness of a low-dose mindfulness intervention for recovery from work. In addition, differential responding to the treatment in terms of treatment-by-baseline interactions was studied. A sample of 140 employees participated in a randomized field experiment with a self-training and a wait-list control group. Three central recovery processes (psychological detachment, sleep quality, and sleep duration) were assessed with event-sampling methodology involving daily measurements over 10 workdays. Growth curve analyses revealed intervention effects on sleep quality and sleep duration. No effects were found for psychological detachment after work and for the proposed treatment-by-baseline interactions. Our findings are discussed in the context of occupational health promotion in general and mindfulness-based interventions in specific.Practitioner points Although daily recovery from the demands of work has been shown to be vital for employee well-being and performance, research on how workplace interventions can help improve recovery is still scarce. This study investigated the effectiveness of a brief, economic mindfulness intervention on processes that are vital for recovery - psychological detachment, sleep quality, and sleep duration. Findings revealed positive effects of the intervention on sleep quality and duration, but not on psychological detachment.","Hulsheger, Ute R.; Feinholdt, Alina; Nubold, Annika",0,10.1111/joop.12115,1663
2162,"Workplace health and safety intervention for child care staff: Rationale, design, and baseline results from the CARE cluster randomized control trial.","BACKGROUND: Low-wage workers suffer disproportionately high rates of chronic disease and are important targets for workplace health and safety interventions. Child care centers offer an ideal opportunity to reach some of the lowest paid workers, but these settings have been ignored in workplace intervention studies.METHODS: Caring and Reaching for Health (CARE) is a cluster-randomized controlled trial evaluating efficacy of a multi-level, workplace-based intervention set in child care centers that promotes physical activity and other health behaviors among staff. Centers are randomized (1:1) into the Healthy Lifestyles (intervention) or the Healthy Finances (attention control) program. Healthy Lifestyles is delivered over six months including a kick-off event and three 8-week health campaigns (magazines, goal setting, behavior monitoring, tailored feedback, prompts, center displays, director coaching). The primary outcome is minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA); secondary outcomes are health behaviors (diet, smoking, sleep, stress), physical assessments (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, fitness), and workplace supports for health and safety.RESULTS: In total, 56 centers and 553 participants have been recruited and randomized. Participants are predominately female (96.7%) and either Non-Hispanic African American (51.6%) or Non-Hispanic White (36.7%). Most participants (63.4%) are obese. They accumulate 17.4 (±14.2) minutes/day of MVPA and consume 1.3 (±1.4) and 1.3 (±0.8) servings/day of fruits and vegetables, respectively. Also, 14.2% are smokers; they report 6.4 (±1.4) hours/night of sleep; and 34.9% are high risk for depression.CONCLUSIONS: Baseline data demonstrate several serious health risks, confirming the importance of workplace interventions in child care.","Ward, Dianne S; Vaughn, Amber E; Hales, Derek; Viera, Anthony J; Gizlice, Ziya; Bateman, Lori A; Grummon, Anna H; Arandia, Gabriela; Linnan, Laura A",1,10.1016/j.cct.2018.02.018,1664
2163,Meditation for combat-related mental health concerns,"The evidence base for mind body interventions has been rapidly expanding. Among various mind body approaches, meditation is one of the most accepted among veterans and widely implemented across the Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) meditation-based approaches are safe, portable, easy to learn, and affordable, with steadily increasing evidence of effectiveness as an adjunct to standard care. This chapter defines meditation and mindfulness, presents a novel classification of meditation techniques, and discusses three forms of meditation practice that offer the most promise in posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd) care mindfulness meditation, mantram repetition program, and compassion meditation. The neurobiology of meditative practices and their role in emotion regulation, alleviating psychiatric symptoms, and promoting well-being is presented. Neuroimaging research and clinical trials for each meditation technique are followed by instructions for each practice, and illustrated through clinical case discussions. The chapter concludes that meditation is a wide-spectrum cost-effective self-management approach to combat-related mental health concerns that may help reduce long-term personal and societal costs. It can alleviate chronic and debilitating symptoms of ptsd and comorbid conditions such as depression, substance use disorder, tobacco use disorder, sleep disturbance, and chronic pain. The self-care quality of meditation allows patients to feel more in control of their symptoms, and empowers them to take an active central role in their own healing process.

2164,Effects of an internet-based lifestyle intervention on cardio-metabolic risks and stress in Korean workers with metabolic syndrome: A controlled trial,"Objective: This study examined the effects of an Internet-based Best Exerciser Super Trainer (BEST) program on cardio-metabolic risks and stress among workers with metabolic syndrome.Methods: This study utilized a non-randomized, pretest, and posttest, controlled design with a convenience sample of 48 Korean male workers. The workers in the BEST group participated in a 16-week Internet-based program: 150 min of regular physical activity per week, 200- to 300-kcal reduced daily diet for weight control, one-on-one counseling, and mobile phone text messages. Workers in the Education group received text messages and an educational booklet.Results: There were significant group by time interactions in cardio-metabolic risks: body weight (p = .022), visceral fat mass (p = .033), and waist circumference (p = .037). There was no group by time interaction in stress (p >. 05); however, the BEST group showed a significantly greater reduction in health-related stress than those in the Education group (p = .025).Conclusion: This study yielded evidence of the beneficial impact of the Internet-based BEST program for workers with metabolic syndrome on selected cardio-metabolic risks and health-related stress. Practice implications: Internet-based one-on-one counseling and mobile phone text messages can assist individuals with targeted lifestyle modifications for metabolic syndrome.

2168,Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) for clinicallyÂ distressed health care workers: Waitlist-controlled evaluation of an ACT workshop in a routine practice setting,"Objectives: To examine the effects of a 1-day acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) workshop on the mental health of clinically distressed health care employees, and to explore ACT's processes of change in a routine practice setting. Design: A quasi-controlled design, with participants block allocated to an ACT intervention or waiting list control group based on self-referral date. Methods: Participants were 35 health care workers who had self-referred for the ACT workshop via a clinical support service for staff. Measures were completed by ACT and control group participants at pre-intervention and 3Â months post-intervention. Participants allocated to the waitlist condition went on to receive the ACT intervention and were also assessed 3Â months later. Results: At 3Â months post-intervention, participants in the ACT group reported a significantly lower level of psychological distress compared to the control group (dÂ =Â 1.41). Across the 3-month evaluation period, clinically significant change was exhibited by 50% of ACT participants, compared to 0% in the control group. When the control group received the same ACT intervention, 69% went on to exhibit clinically significant change. The ACT intervention also resulted in significant improvements in psychological flexibility, defusion, and mindfulness skills, but did not significantly reduce the frequency of negative cognitions. Bootstrapped mediation analyses indicated that the reduction in distress in the ACT condition was primarily associated with an increase in mindfulness skills, especially observing and non-reactivity. Conclusions: These findings provide preliminary support for providing brief ACT interventions as part of routine clinical support services for distressed workers. Practitioner points: A 1-day ACT workshop delivered in the context of a routine staff support service was effective for reducing psychological distress among health care workers. The brief nature of this group intervention means it may be particularly suitable for staff support and primary care mental health service settings. The findings indicate that the beneficial effects of an ACT workshop on distressed employees' mental health were linked to improvements in specific mindfulness skills. Study limitations include non-random allocation of participants to the ACT and control groups, and measurement of mediators and outcome at the same time point (3Â months post-intervention).

2169,Execution of a participatory supportive return to work program within the Dutch social security sector: a qualitative evaluation of stakeholders' perceptions,"Background: A process evaluation of a participatory supportive return to work program, aimed at workers without a (permanent) employment contract who are sick-listed due to a common mental disorder, revealed that this program was executed less successfully than similar programs evaluated in earlier studies. The program consisted of a participatory approach, integrated care and direct placement in competitive employment. Aim of this study was to get a better understanding of the execution of the program by evaluating stakeholders' perceptions. In the absence of an employer, the program was applied by the Dutch Social Security Agency, in collaboration with vocational rehabilitation agencies. Together with the sick-listed workers, these were the main stakeholders. Our research questions involved stakeholders' perceptions of the function (s) of the program, and their perceptions of barriers and facilitators for a successful execution of the program within the Dutch social security sector.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were held with five sick-listed workers, eight professionals of the Social Security Agency, and two case managers of vocational rehabilitation agencies. Interview topics were related to experiences with different components of the program. Selection of respondents was based on purposive sampling and continued until data saturation was reached. Content analysis was applied to identify patterns in the data. Two researchers developed a coding system, based on predefined topics and themes emerging from the data.Results: Although perceived functions of some components of the program were as intended, all stakeholders stressed that the program often had not resulted in return to work. Perceived barriers for a successful execution were related to a poor collaboration between the Dutch Social Security Agency, vocational rehabilitation agencies and healthcare providers, the type of experienced (health) problems, time constraints, and limited job opportunities.Conclusions: For future implementation of the program, it will be important to consider how a better integration of services by the Dutch Social Security Agency, vocational rehabilitation agencies and the mental healthcare sector can be improved in order to address treatment and vocational needs simultaneously, and to better match the sick-listed worker with the limited opportunities in the Dutch labor market.","Lammerts, Lieke; Schaafsma, Frederieke G.; van Mechelen, Willem; Anema, Johannes R.",0,10.1186/s12889-016-2997-x,1668
2170,"Return to work of workers without a permanent employment contract, sick-listed due to a common mental disorder: design of a randomised controlled trial","Background: Workers without a permanent employment contract represent a vulnerable group within the working population. Mental disorders are a major cause of sickness absence within this group. Common mental disorders are stress-related, depressive and anxiety disorders. To date, little attention has been paid to effective return to work interventions for this type of sick-listed workers. Therefore, a participatory supportive return to work program has been developed. It combines elements of a participatory return to work program, integrated care and direct placement in a competitive job. The objective of this paper is to describe the design of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this program compared to care as usual.Methods/Design: The cost-effectiveness of the participatory supportive return to work program will be examined in a randomised controlled trial with a follow-up of twelve months. The program strongly involves the sick-listed worker in the identification of obstacles for return to work and possible solutions, resulting in a consensus based action plan. This plan will be used as a starting point for the search of suitable competitive employment with support of a rehabilitation agency. During this process the insurance physician of the sick-listed worker contacts other caregivers to promote integrated care. Workers eligible to participate in this study have no permanent employment contract, have applied for a sickness benefit at the Dutch Social Security Agency and are sick-listed between two and fourteen weeks due to mental health problems. The primary outcome measure is the duration until first sustainable return to work in a competitive job. Outcomes are measured at baseline and after three, six, nine and twelve months.Discussion: If the participatory supportive return to work program proves to be cost-effective, the social security system, the sick-listed worker and society as a whole will benefit. A cost-effective return to work program will lead to a reduction of costs related to sickness absence. For the sick-listed worker a cost-effective program results in earlier sustainable return to work, which can be associated with both social and health benefits.","Lammerts, Lieke; Vermeulen, Sylvia J.; Schaafsma, Frederieke G.; van Mechelen, Willem; Anema, Johannes R.",0,10.1186/1471-2458-14-594,1669
2171,"The effect of a ""training on work readiness"" program for workers with musculoskeletal injuries: A randomized control trial (RCT) study","Background: This is a clinical randomized trail (RCT) to investigate the effects of a three-week training program on work readiness designed for musculoskeletal injured workers with long-term sick leave who had difficulties resuming their work role. The program was planned to help injured workers overcome the psychological and psychosocial problems and to facilitate their Work Readiness on Return to Work (RTW) based on the Employment readiness model. Methodology: A total of 64 injured workers were recruited and randomly assigned into the training (T) and control (C) groups. Observations were blinded between service providers and evaluators. A three-week intensive training on work readiness program was given to the T group while subjects in the C group were given advice on job placement by social workers in a community work health center. The training program was comprised of individual vocational counseling and group therapy using cognitive behavioral approach to alleviate symptoms of stress, pain and anxiety. The Chinese Lam Assessment of Stages of Employment Readiness (C-LASER), the Chinese State Trait and Anxiety Inventory (C-STAI) and the Short form of Health Survey (SF-36) were used to evaluate all subjects' psychological health status and behavioral changes on job readiness before and after the intervention. Results: Subjects in the T group showed significant improvement in their work readiness (p < 0.05), level of anxiety (p < 0.05) and their self perception of health status measured by SF-36 (p < 0.02) when compared with subjects in the C group. Control of chronic pain, negative motivation, and anxiety level were some of the key behavioral changes found from the study. Conclusion: The TWR program appeared to improve injured workers' motivation and employment readiness. Further study on the employment outcomes of subjects is recommended.","Li, Edward J.

2172,A progressive relaxation intervention at the worksite for African-American women.,"This study examined the efficacy of a worksite-based intervention in reducing blood pressure and personal strain in African-American women. The experimental group (n = 22) was taught a 7-muscle group progressive relaxation intervention. The women, for home practice, used audiocassette tapes and diaries. The control group (n = 21) was asked to set aside 30 minutes for relaxation. All women who participated in the study were visited at the worksite weekly for eight weeks. At the conclusion of the study, the experimental group had a significantly lower mean physical strain score (23.23 [SD = 6.85] v. 27.41 [SD = 8.49]) and interpersonal strain (25.81 [SD = 6.25] v. 23.57 [SD = 6.06]); both groups had significant reductions in psychological strain scores. Although there were no significant differences in the blood pressure of the two groups at the end of the 8-week intervention (121.95 [SD = 13.28] v. 129.33 [SD = 14.30]), the mean systolic blood pressure of the treatment group did decrease from 130 mmHg to 121 mmHg.

2175,Coaching for Workers With Chronic Illness: Evaluating an Intervention,"Working with chronic illness may present challenges for individuals-for instance, managing symptoms at work, attaining accommodations, and career planning while considering health limitations. These challenges may be stressful and lead to strains. We tested a 12-week, 6-session, phone-based coaching intervention designed to help workers manage these challenges and reduce strains. Using theories of stress and resources, we proposed that coaching would help boost workers' internal resources and would lead to improved work ability perceptions, exhaustion and disengagement burnout, job self-efficacy, core self-evaluations, resilience, mental resources, and job satisfaction, and that these beneficial effects would be stable 12 weeks after coaching ended. Fifty-nine full-time workers with chronic illnesses were randomly assigned to either a coaching group or a waitlisted control group. Participants completed online surveys at enrollment, at the start of coaching, after coaching ended, and 12 weeks postcoaching. Compared with the control group, the coaching group showed significantly improved work ability perceptions, exhaustion burnout, core self-evaluations, and resilience-yet no significant improvements were found for job self-efficacy, disengagement burnout, or job satisfaction. Indirect effects of coaching on work ability, exhaustion and disengagement burnout, and job satisfaction were observed through job self-efficacy, core self-evaluations, resilience, and mental resources. Results indicated that the positive effects of coaching were stable 12 weeks after coaching ended. Results suggest that this coaching intervention was helpful in improving the personal well-being of individuals navigating challenges associated with working and managing chronic illness.","McGonagle, Alyssa K.; Beatty, Joy E.; Joffe, Rosalind",0,10.1037/a0036601,1672
2176,Effect of a stress management program on subjects with neck pain: A pilot randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that stress is implicated in the cause of neck pain (NP). OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a simple, zero cost stress management program on patients suffering from NP. METHODS: This study is a parallel-type randomized clinical study. People suffering from chronic non-specific NP were chosen randomly to participate in an eight week duration program of stress management (N = 28) (including diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation) or in a no intervention control condition (N = 25). Self-report measures were used for the evaluation of various variables at the beginning and at the end of the eight-week monitoring period. Descriptive and inferential statistic methods were used for the statistical analysis. RESULTS: At the end of the monitoring period, the intervention group showed a statistically significant reduction of stress and anxiety (p = 0.03, p = 0.01), report of stress related symptoms (p = 0.003), percentage of disability due to NP (p = 0.000) and NP intensity (p = 0.002). At the same time, daily routine satisfaction levels were elevated (p = 0.019). No statistically significant difference was observed in cortisol measurements.

2177,Effect of a multidisciplinary stress treatment programme on the return to work rate for persons with work-related stress. A non-randomized controlled study from a stress clinic,"Background. In recent years an increasing number of patients have been referred to the medical sector with stress symptoms. Moreover, these conditions imply increased sickness absence. This indicates a need for treatment programmes in general medical practice. The aim of this study was to test the effect of a multidisciplinary stress treatment programme on the return to work (RTW) rate in persons with work-related stress and establish predictive factors for this outcome. Methods. During a two-year period 63 out of 73 referrals to the Stress Clinic (a section of a Clinic of Occupational Medicine) completed a stress treatment programme consisted of the following:. 1) Identification of relevant stressors. 2. Changing the coping strategies of the participants. 3. Evaluating/changes in participant workload and tasks. 4. Relaxation techniques. 5. Physical exercise. 6. Psychiatric evaluation when indicated by depression test score. On average each patient attended six one-hour sessions over the course of four months. A group of 34 employees referred to the Clinic of Occupational Medicine by their general practitioners served as a control group. Each participant had a one-hour consultation at baseline and after four months. A specialist in occupational medicine carried out all sessions. Return To Work (RTW), defined as having a job and not being on sick leave at the census, was used as outcome measure four months after baseline, and after one and two years. Results. The level of sick leave in the stress treatment group dropped from 52% to 16% during the first four months of follow-up and remained stable. In the control group, the reduction in sick leave was significantly smaller, ranging from 48% at baseline to 27% after four months and 24% after one year. No statistically significant difference between the two groups was observed after one and two years. Age below 50 years and being a manager increased the odds ratio for RTW after one and two years, while gender and depression had no predictive value. Conclusions. The stress treatment programme showed a significant effect on the return to work rate. The stress treatment programme seems feasible for general practitioners. Trial Registration. ISRCTN04354658.

2178,"Effects of a multidisciplinary stress treatment programme on patient return to work rate and symptom reduction: Results from a randomised, wait-list controlled trial","Background: To evaluate the efficacy of a multidisciplinary stress treatment programme. Methods: General practitioners referred 198 employed patients on sick leave with symptoms of persistent work-related stress. Using a waitlisted randomised controlled trial design, the participants were randomly divided into the following three groups: the intervention group (IG, 69 participants); treatment-as-usual control group (TAUCG, 71 participants), which received 12 consultations with a psychologist, and the waitlisted control group (WLCG, 58 participants). The stress treatment intervention consisted of nine 1-hour sessions conducted over 3 months. The goals of the sessions were the following: (1) identifying relevant stressors; (2) changing the participant's coping strategies; (3) adjusting the participant's workload and tasks, and (4) improving workplace dialogue. Each participant also attended a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course for 2 h a week over 8 weeks. Results: The IG and TAUCG showed significantly greater symptom level (Symptom Check List 92) reductions compared to the WLCG. Regarding the return to work (RTW) rate, 67% of participants in the IG returned to full-time work after treatment, which was a significantly higher rate than in the TAUCG (36%) and WLCG (24%). Significantly more participants in the IG (97%) increased their working hours during treatment compared with the participants in the control groups, TAUCG (71%) and WLCG (64%). Conclusions: The stress treatment programme - a combination of work place-focused psychotherapy and MBSR - significantly reduced stress symptom levels and increased RTW rates compared with the WLCG and TAUCG.

2179,Effectiveness of an exposure-based return-to-work program for workers on sick leave due to common mental disorders: a cluster-randomized controlled trial,"Objectives In case of long-term sick leave, gradually increasing workload appears to be an effective component of work-directed interventions to reduce sick leave due to common mental disorders (CMD). CMD are defined as stress-related, adjustment, anxiety, or depressive disorders. We developed an exposure-based return-to-work (RTW-E) intervention and evaluated the effect on time-to-full return to work (RTW) among workers who were on sick leave due to CMD in comparison to those treated with care-as-usual (CAU). CAU is guideline-directed and consists of problem-solving strategies and graded activities.Methods Using a two-armed cluster-randomized trial, we randomized 56 occupational physicians (OP). Of these, 35 OP treated 160 workers at the start of their sick leave: 75 workers received RTW-E and 85 workers received CAU. These workers were followed over a 12-month follow-up period. The primary outcome measure was time-to-full RTW lasting >= 28 days without recurrence. To evaluate differences between groups, we used intention-to-treat and multilevel Cox's regression analysis.Results The median time-to-full RTW differed significantly between groups [hazard ratio (HR) 0.55; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.33-0.89]. The workers receiving RTW-E (209 days; 95% CI 62-256) had a prolonged time-to-full RTW compared to workers receiving CAU (153 days; 95% CI 128-178).Conclusions Workers on sick leave due to CMD treated with RTW-E showed a prolonged time-to-full RTW compared to those treated with CAU. We recommend that OP do not apply RTW-E but continue counseling workers on sick leave due to CMD according to CAU.","Noordik, Erik; van der Klink, Jac J.; Geskus, Ronald B.; de Boer, Michiel R.; van Dijk, Frank J.

2182,Work Reintegration and Cardiovascular Disease: Medical and Rehabilitation Influences,"Introduction Research into work reintegration following cardiovascular disease onset is limited in its clinical and individual focus. There is no research examining worker experience in context during the return to work process. Methods Qualitative case study method informed by applied ethnography. Worker experience was assessed through longitudinal in-depth interviews with 12 workers returning to work following disabling cardiac illness. Workplace context (Canadian auto manufacturing plant) was assessed through site visits and meetings with stakeholders including occupational health personnel. Data was analyzed using constant comparison and progressive coding. Results Twelve men (43-63 years) participated in the study. Results revealed that unyielding production demands and performance monitoring pushed worker capacities and caused ""insidious stress"". Medical reassurance was important in the workers' decisions to return to work and stay on the job but medical restrictions were viewed as having limited relevance owing to limited understanding of work demands. Medical sanction was important for transient absence from the workplace as well as permanent disability. Cardiac rehabilitation programs were beneficial for lifestyle modification and building exercise capacity, but had limited benefit on work reintegration. Occupational health provided monitoring and support during work reintegration. Conclusions Medical reassurance can be an important influence on worker representations of disease threat. Medical advice as it pertained to work activities was less valued as it lacked considerations of work conditions. Cardiac rehabilitation lacked intensity and relevance to work demands. Occupational health was reassuring for workers and played an important role in developing return to work plans.","O'Hagan, F. T.; Coutu, M. F.; Thomas, S. G.; Mertens, D.

2183,Psychoeducation to facilitate return to work in individuals on sick leave and at risk of having a mental disorder: protocol of a randomised controlled trial,"Background: Sickness absence due to poor mental health is a common problem in many Western countries. To facilitate return to work, it may be important to identify individuals on sick leave and at risk of having a mental disorder and subsequently to offer appropriate treatment. Psychoeducation alone has not previously been used as a return to work intervention, but may be a promising tool to facilitate return to work. Therefore, the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of psychoeducation designed specifically to facilitate return to work for individuals on sick leave and at risk of having a mental disorder. The psychoeducation was a supplement to the various standard offers provided by the job centres.Methods/Design: The study is a randomised controlled trial, in which individuals on sick leave either receive psychoeducation and standard case management or standard case management alone. Participants were individuals with mental health symptoms, who had been on sick leave from part-time or full-time work or unemployment for about 4-8 weeks. The psychoeducational intervention was group-based and the course consisted of 2 hour sessions once a week for 6 weeks. The course was given by psychiatric nurses, a psychologist, a social worker, a physiotherapist and a person who had previously been on sick leave due to mental health problems. The sessions focused on stress and work life, and the purpose was to provide individuals on sick leave the skills to understand and improve their mental functioning. The primary outcome is the duration of sickness absence measured by register data. Secondary outcomes include psychological symptoms, mental health-related quality of life, and locus of control. These outcomes are measured by questionnaires at the start of the intervention and at 3 and 6 months follow-up.Discussion: On the basis of this trial, the effect of psychoeducation for individuals on sick leave and at risk of having a mental disorder will be studied. The results will contribute to the continuing research on sickness absence and mental health. It will primarily show whether psychoeducation can lead to faster and sustainable return to work.","Pedersen, Pernille; Sogaard, Hans Jorgen; Yde, Bjarne Frostholm; Labriola, Merete; Nohr, Ellen A.; Jensen, Chris",0,10.1186/1471-2458-14-1288,1678
2184,Effectiveness of a multidisciplinary worksite stress reduction programme for women,"It has been well established that a high level of stress is associated with medical problems, mental health difficulties and absenteeism at the workplace. The aim of this single-arm study design was to examine the potential effectiveness of a 12-session multidisciplinary stress reduction programme on reducing perceived stress and improving health behaviours and quality of life. One hundred and four women participated in a programme that incorporated group support, skill building and cognitive behavioural and relaxation techniques. A series of Bonferroni corrected t-tests found that the participants reported having significantly (p < 0.001) lower levels of perceived stress, improved health behaviours (sleep, nutrition, physical activity) improved overall health and improved quality of life at the end of the 12 week programme and at 1-month follow-up. Although the effect sizes for improvement were all large, there was no control group, so regression to the mean or selection bias may have impacted the results. Therefore, these results provide initial support for the implementation of gender-based worksite stress reduction programmes and provide guidance in designing an effective worksite stress reduction programme. Further research using randomized controlled trials is warranted.

2185,Improving resiliency in healthcare employees,"Objectives: The high prevalence of stress at the workplace has been well documented; however, few studies have investigated the efficacy of worksite resiliency programs. Therefore, the objective of this project was to examine the impact of a worksite resilience training program on improving resiliency and health behaviors in healthcare employees. Methods: Between 2012 and 2016, 137 adult wellness center members of a healthcare institution participating in a single-arm cohort study of a 12-week resiliency training program were assessed at baseline, end of intervention, and at 3-month follow-up. Results: Statistically significant (p â‰¤ .01) improvements were seen at the end of the intervention and extending to 3 months follow-up for resiliency, perceived stress, anxiety level, quality of life, and health behaviors. Conclusions: These results support the premise that worksite programs designed to improve resiliency in healthcare employees have efficacy in improving resiliency, quality of life and health behaviors. Given the importance of stress and burnout in healthcare employees, future randomized studies are warranted to determine more clearly the impacts of this type of resiliency intervention for improving the wellness of healthcare workers.

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an intervention that enhances well-being and reduces distress, assumedly by means of increasing psychological flexibility (PF). We examined the association between a total increase in PF during an intervention and decreases in stress and increases in well-being during and after the intervention. Method: The intervention was a randomized controlled trial of an ACT-based self-help intervention. Participants were 91 individuals reporting elevated levels of work-related stress. Measurements were completed at preintervention, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Structural equation models revealed that the total increase in PF during the intervention was negatively associated with a decrease in stress (b = -0.63, SE = 0.14, p <.001) and positively associated with an increase in well-being during the intervention (b = 0.48, SE = 0.11, p <.001), but not with a decrease in stress (b = 0.03, SE = 0.27, p >.05) and well-being (b = -0.04, SE = 0.39, p >.05) following the intervention. Conclusions: Our study provides empirical support for decreasing stress and promoting well-being through ACT and emphasizes the potential of PF in promoting well-being.

2187,"Exercise therapy for Stress-related mental disorder, a randomised controlled trial in primary care","Background: to investigate whether a structured physical exercise programme (PEP) improves the recovery of general health in patients suffering from Stress-related Mental Disorder (SMD).Method: Study design: randomised open trial in general practice. Patients from two regions in the Netherlands were included between September 2003 and December 2005, and followed up for 12 weeks. Intervention: the patients were referred to a physical therapist for instruction in and monitoring of physical exercise of an intermediate intensity. Following the Dutch Guidelines for Healthy Physical Exercise, the patients were instructed to exercise at least five times a week, for at least 30 minutes per day.Control group: usual care from the GPOutcome: Primary: improvement of general health after 6 weeks according to the 'general health' dimension of the Short-Form 36.Secondary: total days off work, percentage that resumed work after 6 and 12 weeks, change in distress score and change in remaining SF36 dimensions after 6 and 12 weeks.Results: out of 102 randomised patients (mean age 43, 60 (59%) female), 70 (68%) completed the trial, of whom 31 were in the intervention group. After 6 weeks, the mean (SD) general health score was 54.6 (22.1) for the intervention group and 57.5 (19.2) for the controls. The corresponding effect size (Cohen's d with 95% confidence interval) from analysis of covariance was -0.06 (-0.41, 0.30) indicating no effect on general health. No significant effects of the intervention were detected for any secondary outcome parameter either.Conclusion: Notwithstanding the relatively high drop-out rate, our results suggest that referral to a physical therapist for structured physical exercise is not likely to be very effective in improving recovery from SMD.Trial registry: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN15609105","Quartero, A.

2188,"Intervention to Promote Physician Well-being, Job Satisfaction, and Professionalism A Randomized Clinical Trial","IMPORTANCE Despite the documented prevalence and clinical ramifications of physician distress, few rigorous studies have tested interventions to address the problem.OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that an intervention involving a facilitated physician small-group curriculum would result in improvement in well-being.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial of 74 practicing physicians in the Department of Medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, conducted between September 2010 and June 2012. Additional data were collected on 350 nontrial participants responding to annual surveys timed to coincide with the trial surveys.INTERVENTIONS The intervention involved 19 biweekly facilitated physician discussion groups incorporating elements of mindfulness, reflection, shared experience, and small-group learning for 9 months. Protected time (1 hour of paid time every other week) for participants was provided by the institution.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Meaning in work, empowerment and engagement in work, burnout, symptoms of depression, quality of life, and job satisfaction assessed using validated metrics.RESULTS Empowerment and engagement at work increased by 5.3 points in the intervention arm vs a 0.5-point decline in the control arm by 3 months after the study (P =.04), an improvement sustained at 12 months (+ 5.5 vs + 1.3 points; P =.03). Rates of high depersonalization at 3 months had decreased by 15.5% in the intervention arm vs a 0.8% increase in the control arm (P =.004). This difference was also sustained at 12 months (9.6% vs 1.5% decrease; P =.02). No statistically significant differences in stress, symptoms of depression, overall quality of life, or job satisfaction were seen. In additional comparisons including the nontrial physician cohort, the proportion of participants strongly agreeing that their work was meaningful increased 6.3% in the study intervention arm but decreased 6.3% in the study control arm and 13.4% in the nonstudy cohort (P =.04). Rates of depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and overall burnout decreased substantially in the trial intervention arm, decreased slightly in the trial control arm, and increased in the nontrial cohort (P =.03,.007, and .002 for each outcome, respectively).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE An intervention for physicians based on a facilitated small-group curriculum improved meaning and engagement in work and reduced depersonalization, with sustained results at 12 months after the study.","West, Colin P.; Dyrbye, Liselotte N.; Rabatin, Jeff T.; Call, Tim G.; Davidson, John H.; Multari, Adamarie; Romanski, Susan A.; Hellyer, Joan M.

2190,"A randomized controlled study on assessment of health status, depression, and anxiety in coal miners with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease following yoga training.","CONTEXT: Psychological comorbidities are prevalent in coal miners with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and contribute to the severity of the disease reducing their health status. Yoga has been shown to alleviate depression and anxiety associated with other chronic diseases but in COPD not been fully investigated.AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the role of yoga on health status, depression, and anxiety in coal miners with COPD.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a randomized trial with two study arms (yoga and control), which enrolled 81 coal miners, ranging from 36 to 60 years with stage II and III stable COPD. Both groups were either on conventional treatment or combination of conventional care with yoga program for 12 weeks.RESULTS: Data were collected through standardized questionnaires; COPD Assessment Test, Beck Depression Inventory and State and Trait Anxiety Inventory at the beginning and the end of the intervention. The yoga group showed statistically significant (P < 0.001) improvements on all scales within the group, all significantly different (P < 0.001) from changes observed in the controls. No significant prepost changes were observed in the control group (P > 0.05).CONCLUSION: Yoga program led to greater improvement in physical and mental health status than did conventional care. Yoga seems to be a safe, feasible, and effective treatment for patients with COPD. There is a need to conduct more comprehensive, high-quality, evidence-based studies to shed light on the current understanding of the efficacy of yoga in these chronic conditions and identify unanswered questions.","Ranjita, Rajashree; Badhai, Sumati; Hankey, Alex; Nagendra, Hongasandra R",0,10.4103/0973-6131.183714,1684
2191,Adjuvant occupational therapy for work-related major depression works: Randomized trial including economic evaluation,"Background: Major depression has far-reaching consequences for work functioning and absenteeism. In most cases depression is treated by medication and clinical management. The addition of occupational therapy (OT) might improve outcome. We determined the cost-effectiveness of the addition of OT to treatment as usual (TAU). Method: Sixty-two adults with major depression and a mean absenteeism of 242 days were randomized to TAU (out-patient psychiatric treatment) or TAU+OT [6 months, including (i) diagnostic phase with occupational history and work reintegration plan, and (ii) therapeutic phase with individual sessions and group sessions]. Main outcome domains were depression, work resumption, work stress and costs. Assessments were at baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 42 months. Results: The addition of OT to TAU: (i) did not improve depression outcome, (ii) resulted in a reduction in work-loss days during the first 18 months, (iii) did not increase work stress, and (iv) had a 75.5% probability of being more cost-effective than TAU alone. Conclusion: Addition of OT to good clinical practice does not improve depression outcome, improves productivity without increasing work stress and is superior to TAU in terms of cost-effectiveness.

2192,"Stress management training for surgeons-a randomized, controlled, intervention study","Background: Stress and coping influence performance. In this study, we evaluate a novel stress management intervention for surgeons. Methods: A randomized control group design was used. Sixteen surgeons were allocated to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group received training on coping strategies, mental rehearsal, and relaxation. Performance measures were obtained during simulated operations and included objective-structured assessment of technical skill, observational teamwork assessment for surgery, and end product assessment rated by experts. Stress was assessed using the state-trait-anxiety-inventory, observer rating, coefficient of heart rate variability (C-HRV), and salivary cortisol. The number of applied surgical coping strategies (number of coping strategies [NC]) was assessed using a questionnaire. A t test for paired samples investigated any within-subject changes, and multiple linear regression analysis explored between-subject effects. Interviews explored surgeons perceptions of the intervention. Results:: The intervention group showed enhanced observational teamwork assessment for surgery performance (t = -2.767, P < 0.05), and increased coping skills (t = -4.690, P < 0.01), and reduced stress reflected inheart rate variability (t = -4.008, P < 0.01). No significant changes were identified in the control group. Linear regression analysis confirmed a significant effect on NC (Î² = -0.739, P < 0.01). Qualitative data analysis revealed improved technical skills, decision making, and confidence. Conclusions: The intervention had beneficial effects on coping, stress, and nontechnical skills during simulated surgery.

2193,Acceptability of Online Self-Help to People With Depression: Users' Views of MoodGYM Versus Informational Websites,"Background: Little is known about the factors that influence acceptability of and adherence to online psychological interventions. Evidence is needed to guide further development of promising programs.Objective: Our goal was to investigate users' views of two online approaches to self-help for depression: computerized cognitive behavior therapy (cCBT) and informational websites, in a workplace context. Computerized CBT offers an inexpensive and accessible alternative to face-to-face therapy, and employers have an interest in reducing the working time lost to depression or stress. Yet little is known about how employees, who have actual experience of using online approaches, judge the intervention as a process.Methods: The qualitative data reported here were collected within an online randomized controlled trial whose participants had diagnosable depression. The experimental intervention was a 5-week cCBT program called MoodGYM, and the control condition was five informational websites about mental health. Data were collected via online questionnaires. There was no evidence of the superiority of either in terms of treatment outcomes. In parallel, using brief rating scales and open-ended questions designed for this purpose, we examined the relative acceptability of each approach over time, including perceptions of cCBT compared to seeing a health care professional.Results: At least 60% of participants held online therapy to be at least as acceptable as seeing a professional about mental health issues, and they were more likely to retain this opinion over time if they used the interactive program, MoodGYM, rather than informational websites alone. Barriers to cCBT use fell into four categories: intrinsic, intrapersonal problems; extrinsic technical problems; generic issues mostly pertaining to perceptions of cCBT; and specific issues about the intervention or control condition. These indicate strategies for improving engagement.Conclusions: As first-aid for mild to moderate mental health problems, evidence-based computerized approaches have broad acceptability. This could be increased by attending to the barriers noted here and by proactively managing users' expectations at individual and organizational levels. The findings have implications for occupational health providers and others addressing the needs of working-age adults with depression. They also raise methodological issues for online research.","Schneider, Justine; Foroushani, Pooria Sarrami; Grime, Paul; Thornicroft, Graham",0,10.2196/jmir.2871,1687
2194,Design of a randomized controlled trial on the effect on return to work with coaching plus light therapy and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy for workers with work-related chronic stress,"Background: Work-related chronic stress is a common problem among workers. The core complaint is that the employee feels exhausted, which has an effect on the well-being and functioning of the employee, and an impact on the employer and society. The employee's absence is costly due to lost productivity and medical expenses. The usual form of care for work-related chronic stress is coaching, using a cognitive-behavioural approach whose primary aim is to reduce symptoms and improve functioning. Light therapy and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy are used for the treatment of several mental and physical disorders. The objective of this study is to determine whether coaching combined with light therapy plus pulsed electromagnetic field therapy is an effective treatment for reducing absenteeism, fatigue and stress, and improving quality of life compared to coaching alone.Methods/design: The randomized placebo-controlled trial consists of three arms. The population consists of 90 participants with work-related chronic stress complaints. The research groups are: (i) intervention group; (ii) placebo group; and (iii) control group. Participants in the intervention group will be treated with light therapy/pulsed electromagnetic field therapy for 12 weeks, twice a week for 40 min, and coaching (once a fortnight for 50 min). The placebo group receives the same treatment but with the light and pulsed electromagnetic field switched to placebo settings. The control group receives only coaching for 12 weeks, a course of six sessions, once a fortnight for 50 min. The primary outcome is the level of return to work. Secondary outcomes are fatigue, stress and quality of life. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 and 24 weeks after start of treatment.Discussion: This study will provide information about the effectiveness of coaching and light therapy plus pulsed electromagnetic field therapy on return to work, and secondly on fatigue, stress and quality of life in people with work-related chronic stress.Trial registration: NTR4794, registration date 18-sept-2014","Schoutens, Antonius M.

2195,"""taking my breath away by keeping stress at bay"" - An employee assistance program in the automotive assembly plant","Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of individual-focused stress management train-ing namely Deep Breathing Exercise (DBE) on self-perceived occupational stress among male automotive assembly-line workers. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted at 2 automotive assembly plants in Malaysia over 9 months, from January 2012 to September 2012. Assembly-line workers from Plant A received DBE training while Plant B act-ed as a control by receiving pamphlets on stress and its ill-effects. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted among the self-voluntary respondents in Plant A (n=468) and Plant B (n=293). The level of stress was measured using Depres-sion Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) stress subscale. Results: Significant favorable intervention effects were found in Plant A (Effect size=0.6) as compared to Plant B (Effect size=0.2) at the end of the study in those receiving DBE. Time and group interaction effects were examined using the repeated measure ANOVA test in which there was a significant group *time interaction effect [F (1, 1) = 272.45, P<0.001]. Conclusion: The improvement in stress levels showed the potential of DBE training as part of Employee Assistance Program in the automotive assembly plant. Future studies should be carried out to assess the long term effects of an on-site relaxation training to provide stronger evidence for the introduction of DBE among assembly-line workers as a coping strategy to alleviate occupational stress.","Sundram B.M., Dahlui M., Chinna K.",0,,1689
2196,Development of a workplace intervention for sick-listed employees with stress-related mental disorders: Intervention Mapping as a useful tool,"Background. To date, mental health problems and mental workload have been increasingly related to long-term sick leave and disability. However, there is, as yet, no structured protocol available for the identification and application of an intervention for stress-related mental health problems at the workplace. This paper describes the structured development, implementation and planning for the evaluation of a return-to-work intervention for sick-listed employees with stress-related mental disorders (SMDs). The intervention is based on an existing successful return-to-work intervention for sick-listed employees with low back pain. Methods. The principles of Intervention Mapping were applied to combine theory and evidence in the development, implementation and planning for the evaluation of a participatory workplace intervention, aimed at an early return-to-work for sick-listed employees with SMDs. All stakeholders were involved in focus group interviews: i.e. employees recently sick-listed with SMDs, supervisors and occupational health professionals. Results. The development of the participatory workplace intervention according to the Intervention Mapping principles resulted in a structured return-to-work intervention, specifically tailored to the needs of sick-listed employees with SMDs. Return-to-work was proposed as a behavioural change, and the Attitude - Social influence - self-Efficacy model was identified as a theoretical framework. Stakeholder involvement in focus group interviews served to enhance the implementation. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Conclusion. Intervention Mapping was found to be a promising method to develop interventions tailored to a specific target group in the field of occupational health. Trial registration. ISRCTN92307123.

2197,Cost-effectiveness of a workplace intervention for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders: design of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Considering the high costs of sick leave and the consequences of sick leave for employees, an early return-to-work of employees with mental disorders is very important. Therefore, a workplace intervention is developed based on a successful return-to-work intervention for employees with low back pain. The objective of this paper is to present the design of a randomized controlled trial evaluating the cost-effectiveness of the workplace intervention compared with usual care for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders.Methods: The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with a follow-up of one year. Employees eligible for this study are on sick leave for 2 to 8 weeks with common mental disorders. The workplace intervention will be compared with usual care. The workplace intervention is a stepwise approach that aims to reach consensus about a return-to-work plan by active participation and strong commitment of both the sick-listed employee and the supervisor. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The primary outcome of this study is lasting return-to-work, which will be acquired from continuous registration systems of the companies after the follow- up. Secondary outcomes are total number of days of sick leave during the follow- up, severity of common mental disorders, coping style, job content, and attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy determinants. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated from the societal perspective. A process evaluation will also be conducted.Discussion: Return-to-work is difficult to discuss in the workplace for sick-listed employees with mental disorders and their supervisors. Therefore, this intervention offers a unique opportunity for the sick-listed employee and the supervisor to discuss barriers for return-to-work. Results of this study will possibly contribute to improvement of disability management for sick-listed employees with common mental disorders. Results will become available in 2009.","van Oostrom, Sandra H.; Anema, Johannes R.; Terluin, Berend; de Vet, Henrica C. W.; Knol, Dirk L.; van Mechelen, Willem",0,10.1186/1471-2458-8-12,1691
2198,Economic evaluation of a workplace intervention for sick-listed employees with distress,"Objectives To evaluate the cost effectiveness, cost utility and cost benefit of a workplace intervention compared with usual care for sick-listed employees with distress.Methods An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial. Employees with distress and who were sick-listed for 2-8 weeks were randomised to a workplace intervention (n = 73) or to usual care (n = 72). The workplace intervention is a stepwise process involving the sick-listed employee and their supervisor, aimed at formulating a consensus-based plan for return to work (RTW). The effect outcomes were lasting RTW and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Healthcare utilisation was measured over 12 months. Cost effectiveness analyses (CEA) and cost utility analyses (CUA) were conducted from the societal perspective and cost benefit analyses (CBA) from the employer perspective. Bootstrapping techniques were used to estimate cost and effect differences, related CIs, and cost effectiveness and cost utility ratios. Cost effectiveness planes were presented and subgroup analyses were performed.Results CEA and CUA revealed no statistically significant differences in lasting RTW, QALYs or costs. The CBA indicated a statistically significant higher cost of occupational health services in the workplace intervention group. The workplace intervention was not cost effective according to the CEA, CUA and CBA.Conclusions Widespread implementation of the workplace intervention for sick-listed employees with distress is not recommended because there was no economic benefit compared with usual care. Future trials should confirm if the workplace intervention is cost effective for the subgroup employees who intended to return to work despite symptoms.","van Oostrom, Sandra H.; Heymans, Martijn W.; de Vet, Henrica C.

2199,Effectiveness of a multidisciplinary care program on recovery and return to work of patients after gynaecological surgery; design of a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Return to work after gynaecological surgery takes much longer than expected, irrespective of the level of invasiveness. In order to empower patients in recovery and return to work, a multidisciplinary care program consisting of an e-health intervention and integrated care management including participatory workplace intervention was developed.METHODS/DESIGN: We designed a randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of the multidisciplinary care program on full sustainable return to work in patients after gynaecological surgery, compared to usual clinical care. Two hundred twelve women (18-65 years old) undergoing hysterectomy and/or laparoscopic adnexal surgery on benign indication in one of the 7 participating (university) hospitals in the Netherlands are expected to take part in this study at baseline. The primary outcome measure is sick leave duration until full sustainable return to work and is measured by a monthly calendar of sickness absence during 26 weeks after surgery. Secondary outcome measures are the effect of the care program on general recovery, quality of life, pain intensity and complications, and are assessed using questionnaires at baseline, 2, 6, 12 and 26 weeks after surgery.DISCUSSION: The discrepancy between expected physical recovery and actual return to work after gynaecological surgery contributes to the relevance of this study. There is strong evidence that long periods of sick leave can result in work disability, poorer general health and increased risk of mental health problems. We expect that this multidisciplinary care program will improve peri-operative care, contribute to a faster return to work of patients after gynaecological surgery and, as a consequence, will reduce societal costs considerably.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands Trial Register (NTR): NTR2087.","Vonk Noordegraaf, Antonie; Huirne, Judith A F; Brolmann, Hans A M; Emanuel, Mark H; van Kesteren, Paul J M; Kleiverda, Gunilla; Lips, Jos P; Mozes, Alexander; Thurkow, Andreas L; van Mechelen, Willem; Anema, Johannes R",0,10.1186/1472-6963-12-29,1693
2200,Evaluation of an internet-based aftercare program to improve vocational reintegration after inpatient medical rehabilitation: study protocol for a cluster-randomized controlled trial,"Background: Mental disorders are the main reasons for rising proportions of premature pension in most high-income countries. Although inpatient medical rehabilitation has increasingly targeted work-related stress, there is still a lack of studies on the transfer of work-specific interventions into work contexts. Therefore, we plan to evaluate an online aftercare program aiming to improve vocational reintegration after medical rehabilitation.Methods: Vocationally strained patients (n = 800) aged between 18 and 59 years with private internet access are recruited in psychosomatic, orthopedic and cardiovascular rehabilitation clinics in Germany. During inpatient rehabilitation, participants in stress management group training are cluster-randomized to the intervention or control group. The intervention group (n = 400) is offered an internet-based aftercare with weekly writing tasks and therapeutic feedback, a patient forum, a self-test and relaxation exercises. The control group (n = 400) obtains regular e-mail reminders with links to publicly accessible information about stress management and coping. Assessments are conducted at the beginning of inpatient rehabilitation, the end of inpatient rehabilitation, the end of aftercare, and 9 months later. The primary outcome is a risk score for premature pension, measured by a screening questionnaire at follow-up. Secondary outcome measures include level of vocational stress, physical and mental health, and work capacity at follow-up.Discussion: We expect the intervention group to stabilize the improvements achieved during inpatient rehabilitation concerning stress management and coping, resulting in an improved vocational reintegration. The study protocol demonstrates the features of internet-based aftercare in rehabilitation.","Zwerenz, Ruediger; Gerzymisch, Katharina; Edinger, Jens; Holme, Martin; Knickenberg, Rudolf J.; Spoerl-Doench, Sieglinde; Kiwus, Ulrich; Beutel, Manfred E.",0,10.1186/1745-6215-14-26,1694

Multimodal biopsychosocial training programs incorporating complementary and alternative self-management techniques have the potential to reduce stress-related symptoms and dysfunction. Such training can preempt or attenuate the posttraumatic stress response and may be effectively incorporated into the training cycle for deploying and redeploying troops and their families. A large systematic review was conducted to survey the literature on multimodal training programs for the self-management of emotional stress. This report is an overview of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified in this systematic review. Select programs such as mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction, Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management, Autogenic Training, Relaxation Response Training, and other meditation and mind-body skills practices are highlighted, and the feasibility of their implementation within military settings is addressed.

2202,Acute and chronic stress increase salivary cortisol: A study in the real-life setting of a national examination undertaken by medical graduates,"Spanish medical graduates who apply for a medical specialty training position (MIR) must take an examination that will shape their future personal and professional lives. Preparation for the test represents an important stressor that persists for several months. The aim of this study was to elucidate the stress pattern of this group and evaluate possible changes in the circadian rhythm of cortisol release in medical graduates preparing for this test. A repeated-measures longitudinal study was performed, measuring the salivary cortisol concentrations in 36 medical graduates (13 males and 23 females; mean age of 24.2 years) on five sampling days. Five cortisol samples were collected from 07:00 to 21:00h in order to monitor changes in the circadian rhythm. On all sampling days (except on the day of the official examination), anxiety and psychological stress were evaluated with the Spanish versions of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). During the study period, participants showed higher levels of anxiety than the Spanish reference population as well as a progressive increase in self-perceived stress. A significant increase in salivary cortisol concentration was observed in both chronic (study and examination preparation) and acute (examinations) situations. Our results suggest that the cortisol awakening response (CAR) may be a good indicator of anticipatory stress but is unaffected by long-term examination preparation. Comparison of results between the official examination day and the mock examination days yielded evidence that learning may modulate the behavior of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

2203,Reduced emotional stress reactivity to a real-life academic examination stressor in students participating in a 20-week aerobic exercise training: A randomised controlled trial using Ambulatory Assessment,"Objectives: To examine if a preventive 20-week aerobic exercise intervention (AET) can improve emotional stress reactivity during real-life stress. Design: Randomised controlled trial; within-subject design. Method: Sixty-one inactive students were randomly assigned to a waiting control and an AET group. To capture the situation-specific, intra-individual data in real life, electronic diaries were used. Participants reported their moods and perceived stress (PS) repeatedly over two days during their daily routines pre- and post-intervention. The pre-intervention baseline assessment was scheduled at the beginning of the semester, and the post-intervention assessment was scheduled at a real-life stressful episode, an academic examination. For the aerobic fitness assessment, both groups completed a cardiopulmonary exercise test on the treadmill before and after the intervention. Multilevel models (MLMs) were conducted to compare within- and between-subject associations. Results: Significant emotional stress reactivity was evident in both groups during all assessment periods. However, participants in the AET group showed lower emotional stress reactivity compared with their control counterparts after the 20-week training programme during the real-life stress episode (the academic examination). Conclusions: AET conferred beneficial effects on emotional stress reactivity during an academic examination, which is likely an extremely stressful real-life situation for students.AET appears to be a promising strategy against the negative health effects of accumulated emotional stress reactivity.

Participants completed a composite version of the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) which assessed both intensity and direction (debilitative-facilitative) of state anxiety, within one hour of a competitive Invasion Game. Four matched groups were established and given the following different treatments; Cognitive-Affective Stress Management (multimodal) (n=10), Positive Thought Control (unimodal compatible) (n=10), Applied Relaxation (unimodal non-compatible) (n=10) and placebo tasks were given to the Control Group (n=11). Following the six-week interventions the participants were again assessed before a second competitive Invasion Game. A series of two-way analyses of variance (group and event) with repeated measures on the second factor, indicated some treatments to be more effective than others. The multi-modal intervention was most effective overall. However, the unimodal compatible treatment was as effective as the multimodal treatment, on the targeted composite CSAI-2 subscale, and took approximately half the time to deliver to the participants.","Maynard, IW; Hemmings, B; Greenlees, IA; Warwick-Evans, L; Stanton, N",0,10.1080/10615809808248313,1698

Methods: Fifty-six postgraduate clinical psychology students completed questionnaires. Qualitative and quantitative data concerning students' views of an ACT stress management intervention and clinical training were collected. Results: Most CPTs reported that they would recommend the intervention to other CPTs and that they found it personally and professionally useful. The majority of participants also reported marked improvement on indicators of psychological flexibility. Qualitative data suggested three broad structural changes to clinical training (better preparation prior to commencing clinical work, reduced workload, and better organisation), some of which have implications for curriculum development. Conclusions: Findings support the use of an ACT stress management intervention for addressing CPT stress and the integration of self-care into the curriculum.

2206,Does personal initiative training work as a stress management intervention?,"An experimental trial is reported that compares 2 stress management intervention programs and a waitlist control. Both programs involved training in problem-focused strategies of identifying and changing the sources of stress. One of the programs contained additional content on how to display more personal initiative (PI). Both programs involved 2 sessions held I week apart, each session lasting 3-4 hr. Strain was measured before training and at 7 and 13 weeks after the initial session. Results show that both programs were effective at reducing strain, whereas the waitlist group showed no change in strain. The PI program increased proactive behavior at 7 weeks as determined by independent evaluations, although the same pattern was not. observed for PI self-reports. Proactive behavior did not appear to mediate the effects of training programs on strain.","Searle, BJ",0,10.1037/1076-8998.13.3.259,1700
2208,Effects of Person-Centered Care Approaches to Dementia Care on Staff,"Person-centered care (PCC) has been the subject of several intervention studies reporting positive effects on people with dementia. However, its impact on staff remains unclear. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the impact of PCC approaches on stress, burnout, and job satisfaction of staff caring for people with dementia in residential aged care facilities. Research articles published up to 2013 were searched on PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, and EBSCO and reference lists from relevant publications. The review was limited to experimental and quasi-experimental studies, published in English and involving direct care workers (DCWs). In all, 7 studies were included, addressing different PCC approaches: dementia care mapping (n = 1), stimulation-oriented approaches (n = 2), emotion-oriented approaches (n = 2), and behavioral-oriented approaches (n = 2). Methodological weaknesses and heterogeneity among studies make it difficult to draw firm conclusions. However, 5 studies reported benefits on DCWs, suggesting a tendency toward the effectiveness of PCC on staff.

2209,How Effective are Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Reducing Stress Among Healthcare Professionals? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Workplace stress is high among healthcare professionals (HCPs) and is associated with reduced psychological health, quality of care and patient satisfaction. This systematic review and meta-analysis reviews evidence on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for reducing stress in HCPs. A systematic literature search was conducted. Papers were screened for suitability using inclusion criteria and nine papers were subjected to review and quality assessment. Seven papers, for which full statistical findings could be obtained, were also subjected to meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis suggest that MBIs have the potential to significantly improve stress among HCPs; however, there was evidence of a file drawer problem. The quality of the studies was high in relation to the clarity of aims, data collection and analysis, but weaker in terms of sample size and the use of theoretical frameworks. MBIs have the potential to reduce stress among HCPs; however, more high-quality research is needed before this finding can be confirmed. Future studies would benefit from long-term follow-up measures to determine any continuing effects of mindfulness training on stress outcomes. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

2210,Meta-Analysis of Workplace Physical Activity Interventions,"Context: Most adults do not achieve adequate physical activity levels. Despite the potential benefits of worksite health promotion, no previous comprehensive meta-analysis has summarized health and physical activity behavior outcomes from such programs. This comprehensive meta-analysis integrated the extant wide range of worksite physical activity intervention research.Evidence acquisition: Extensive searching located published and unpublished intervention studies reported from 1969 through 2007. Results were coded from primary studies. Random-effects meta-analytic procedures, including moderator analyses, were completed in 2008.Evidence synthesis: Effects on most variables were substantially heterogeneous because diverse studies were included. Standardized mean difference (d) effect sizes were synthesized across approximately 38,231 subjects. Significantly positive effects were observed for physical activity behavior (0.21); fitness (0.57); lipids (0.13); anthropometric measures (0.08); work attendance (0.19); and job stress (0.33). The significant effect size for diabetes risk (0.98) is less robust given small sample sizes. The mean effect size for fitness corresponds to a difference between treatment minus control subjects' means on VO(2max) of 3.5 mL/kg/min; for lipids, -0.2 on the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipo protein; and for diabetes risk, -12.6 mg/dL on fasting glucose.Conclusions: These findings document that some workplace physical activity interventions can improve both health and important worksite outcomes. Effects were variable for most outcomes, reflecting the diversity of primary studies. Future primary research should compare interventions to confirm causal relationships and further explore heterogeneity.

2211,Changes in stress and coping from a randomized controlled trial of a three-month stress management intervention,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate whether a group-based stress management intervention, based on principles from cognitive behavior therapy, can reduce stress and alter coping strategies in an occupationally diverse population with extensive symptoms of work-related stress. Methods: Using a randomized wait list control design, 102 participants were divided into two groups: intervention and wait list control. The intervention was a three-month group-based stress management program. Outcomes measures were the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10, range 0-40 points) and five dimensions from the Brief COPE questionnaire (range 2-8 points) at baseline and three-, six- and nine-months follow-up. Data were analyzed with a univariate analysis of variance. Results: On the PSS-10 from baseline to three months, the intervention group changed -6.45 (95% CI -8.25 - -4.64) points, compared to -1.12 (95% CI -2.94-0.70) points in the wait list control group. The between-groups difference was -5.32 (95% CI -7.89- -2.76) points, equalling a standardized mean difference of -0.84 (95% CI -1.27- -0.42) favouring the intervention. One coping dimension, ""positive reframing"", differed between the two groups. Here the intervention group changed -0.86 (95% CI -1.25- -0.48) points from baseline to three months, compared to -0.18 (-0.58-0.22) points in the wait list control group. We found a between-groups difference of -0.67 (95% CI -1.24- -0.11) points, equalling a standardized mean difference of -0.48 (95% CI -0.89- -0.07) favouring the intervention. The gains achieved during treatment were maintained when followed up three months later. Conclusions: Treatment is superior to the control condition in positively affecting perceived stress and positive reframing. When followed up, the gains achieved are maintained. Key terms: brief COPE; cognitive behavior therapy; follow-up; group treatment; positive reframing; Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10); wait list control.","Willert M.V., Thulstrup A.M., Hertz J., Bonde J.P.",1,10.5271/sjweh.1313,1704

Method: Literature review of what the author believes in are seminal articles highlighting workplace factors and interventions in preventing depression in the workplace. Results: Employees can help prevent depression by building protective factors such as better coping and stress management skills. Employees may be candidates for depression screening if they have certain risk factors such as performance concerns. Organizational interventions such as improving mental health literacy and focusing on work-life balance may help prevent depression in the workplace but deserve further study. Conclusion: A strategy to prevent depression in the workplace can include developing individual resilience, screening high-fisk individuals and reducing that risk, improving organizational literacy, and integrating workplace and health care systems to allow access to Proactive quality interventions.","Couser, Gregory P.",0,10.1097/JOM.0b013e318168efe2,1705
2213,A META-ANALYTICAL STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TECHNIQUES FOR REDUCING DISTRESS IN ORGANIZATIONS,"There is a large body of literature on the effectiveness of psychological programs on reducing emotional distress and its consequences. More specifically, there is evidence showing that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) based intervention programs are the most frequently used in reducing emotional distress and its consequences in occupational settings. We conducted a meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of CBT-based interventions in this setting. Twenty-three (23) studies were included in our analysis, with 1282 participants. The overall weighted effect size (Cohen's d) for all studies was -0.81 (95% CI -1.72 to -0.45). Furthermore, we analyzed separately the effectiveness of programs based on Rational Emotional Behavioral Therapy (REBT) and other CBT programs. When we separated the studies in these two categories the effect size increased for REBT based intervention programs (D = -1.14), while the effect size for the rest of CBT based programs slightly decreased (D = -0.52). In addition, we calculated effect sizes for irrationality (D = -1.6), direct evaluation of emotional distress (D = -0.73), and for measures of distress consequences (D = -0.69). Results demonstrate the effectiveness of CBT-based intervention programs in reducing emotional distress, distress consequences and in reducing the level of irrationality in occupational settings.","David, Alin R.; Szamoskozi, Stefan",0,,1706
2214,Stress Gym: Feasibility of deploying a web-enhanced behavioral self-management program for stress in a military setting,"Stress and depression can adversely impact the performance of military personnel. Cognitive-behavioral (CBT) interventions for managing stress are effi cacious in traditional face-to-face formats, but the Internet supports a broader reach of these programs. This study reports on the feasibility of using an Internet-based self-help stress-management intervention in military personnel. There were 142 offi cers/enlisted sailors at a Naval Medical Center who completed the program. Evaluation of the program titled ""Stress Gym"" was positive for the user interface, content, feasibility, and satisfaction. Positive evaluation was not infl uenced by rank/status, sex, or previous deployment. Stress ratings alsodecreased signifi cantly while using the program. These data support Stress Gym as being an online CBT-based selfhelp intervention that is feasible to deploy, accepted by the intended end users, and demonstrates the intended goal of reducing stress.","Williams A., Hagerty B.M., Brasington S.J., Clem J.B., Williams D.A.",1,10.7205/MILMED-D-09-00216,1707
2215,Job burnout in mental health providers: A meta-analysis of 35 years of intervention research,"Burnout is prevalent among mental health providers and is associated with significant employee, consumer, and organizational costs. Over the past 35 years, numerous intervention studies have been conducted but have yet to be reviewed and synthesized using a quantitative approach. To fill this gap, we performed a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of burnout interventions for mental health workers. We completed a systematic literature search of burnout intervention studies that spanned more than 3 decades (1980 to 2015). Each eligible study was independently coded by 2 researchers, and data were analyzed using a random-effects model with effect sizes based on the Hedges' g statistic. We computed an overall intervention effect size and performed moderator analyses. Twenty-seven unique samples were included in the meta-analysis, representing 1,894 mental health workers. Interventions had a small but positive effect on provider burnout (Hedges' g = .13, p = .006). Moderator analyses suggested that persondirected interventions were more effective than organization-directed interventions at reducing emotional exhaustion (Qbetween = 6.70, p = .010) and that job training/education was the most effective organizational intervention subtype (Qbetween = 12.50, p < .001). Lower baseline burnout levels were associated with smaller intervention effects and accounted for a significant proportion of effect size variability. The field has made limited progress in ameliorating mental health provider burnout. Based on our findings, we suggest that researchers implement a wider breadth of interventions that are tailored to address unique organizational and staff needs and that incorporate longer follow-up periods.

Early intervention or prevention approaches may support teachers to develop positive coping and reduce the experience and impact of stress. This article reviews research on one such approach: mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for school teachers. A systematic review and narrative synthesis were conducted for quantitative and qualitative studies that report the effects of MBIs for teachers of children aged 5â€“18Â years on symptoms of stress and emotion regulation and self-efficacy. Twelve independent publications were identified meeting the inclusion criteria and these gave a total of 13 samples. Quality appraisal of the identified articles was carried out. The effect sizes and proportion of significant findings are reported for relevant outcomes. The quality of the literature varied, with main strengths in reporting study details, and weaknesses including sample size considerations. A range of MBIs were employed across the literature, ranging in contact hours and aims. MBIs showed strongest promise for intermediary effects on teacher emotion regulation. The results of the review are discussed in the context of a model of teacher stress. Teacher social and emotional competence has implications for pupil wellbeing through teacherâ€“pupil relationships and effective management of the classroom. The implications for practice and research are considered. Â© 2017, The Author(s).","Emerson L.-M., Leyland A., Hudson K., Rowse G., Hanley P., Hugh-Jones S.",0,10.1007/s12671-017-0691-4,1709
2217,A mixed-methods systematic review of the effects of mindfulness on nurses,"Aim. To review the effects of mindfulness-based interventions on Registered Nurses and nursing students.Background. Work-related stress among nurses is estimated to be the biggest occupational health problem after musculoskeletal disorders.Design. A mixed-method systematic review incorporating quantitative and qualitative data was conducted.Data sources. Studies on the effects of mindfulness-based interventions for nurses and nursing students published between 1980 and 2014 were identified through a systematic search in electronic databases: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and Cinahl.Review methods. Data analysis was conducted based on the framework of Thomas and Harden (2004).Results. A total of 32 studies, including 17 controlled designs, 11 pre-post designs and four qualitative designs were reviewed. Meta-analysis suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may be effective in significantly reducing state anxiety and depression at posttreatment and state anxiety and trait anxiety at follow-up. Qualitative studies and uncontrolled studies shed light on benefits overlooked in RCTs, including improvements in the well-being of individuals (e.g. inner state of calmness, awareness and enthusiasm) and improved performance at work (better communication with colleagues and patients, higher sensitivity to patients' experiences, clearer analysis of complex situations and emotional regulation in stressful contexts).Conclusions. Mindfulness appeared to improve nurses' mental health significantly. It could be used in worksite health promotion programmes. Only a few studies have explored the impact of mindfulness on nurses' professional behaviours and their relationships with patients and colleagues. Future research should further explore the long-term impacts of mindfulness on performance and well-being at work using sound methodological designs.","Guillaumie, Laurence; Boiral, Olivier; Champagne, Julie",0,10.1111/jan.13176,1710
2218,A cognitive therapy program for hearing-impaired employees suffering from mental distress,"Objective: To develop a cognitive therapy program to reduce mental distress among hearing-impaired employees. Design: In a pilot study we measured the development of mental distress and avoidant coping among hearing-impaired employees. Levels of mental distress were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HAD), and the extent of avoidance with conversation tactics checklist CONV(AVOID). The findings were compared with the development in a treatment as usual (TAU) sample. Study sample: Fifteen participants with an equal distribution of male and female participants (M = 49.2 years) took part. The majority had mild to moderate hearing impairment. Results: The program appeared to be feasible and the adherence was good. The mean depression score was identical at pre-and post-intervention in the intervention group, and increased from 2.9 (SD 2.1) to 3.1 (SD 2.0) in the TAU group. Symptoms of anxiety (p < 0.01, 95 % CI (.82, 3.98)) and avoidant communication (p < 0.05, 95% CI (.5, 4.61)) decreased significantly in the intervention group, while an opposite pattern was observed during the TAU program. Conclusions: The program showed promising results. However, the preliminary results should be further investigated in a randomized controlled trial using a larger sample.","Williams, Katharine Cecilia; Falkum, Erik; Martinsen, Egil Wilhelm",1,10.3109/14992027.2014.958621,1711
2219,Improving the wellbeing of staff who work in palliative care settings: A systematic review of psychosocial interventions,"Background: Staff in palliative care settings perform emotionally demanding roles which may lead to psychological distress including stress and burnout. Therefore, interventions have been designed to address these occupational risks.Aim: To investigate quantitative studies exploring the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions that attempt to improve psychological wellbeing of palliative care staff.Design: A systematic review was conducted according to methodological guidance from UK Centre for Reviews and Dissemination.Data sources: A search strategy was developed based on the initial scans of palliative care studies. Potentially eligible research articles were identified by searching the following databases: CINAHL, MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycINFO and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened studies against pre-set eligibility criteria. To assess quality, both researchers separately assessed the remaining studies using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies.Results: A total of 1786 potentially eligible articles were identified - nine remained following screening and quality assessment. Study types included two randomised controlled trials, two non-randomised controlled trial designs, four one-group pre-post evaluations and one process evaluation. Studies took place in the United States and Canada (5), Europe (3) and Hong Kong (1). Interventions comprised a mixture of relaxation, education, support and cognitive training and targeted stress, fatigue, burnout, depression and satisfaction. The randomised controlled trial evaluations did not improve psychological wellbeing of palliative care staff. Only two of the quasi-experimental studies appeared to show improved staff wellbeing although these studies were methodologically weak.Conclusion: There is an urgent need to address the lack of intervention development work and high-quality research in this area.","Hill, Rebecca C.; Dempster, Martin; Donnelly, Michael; McCorry, Noleen K.",0,10.1177/0269216316637237,1712

Randomized-controlled trials (RCT) and quasi-experimental studies evaluating primary or secondary brief interventions carried out in the workplace settings were included. Subsequently, common interventions matching brief interventions by type and assessed outcomes were included. The methodological quality of included studies was appraised using NICE guidelines, and the best evidence synthesis approach was applied.Results The review identified 11 brief interventions and 9 corresponding common interventions. Included studies varied substantially in sample size and characteristics, methodological quality, duration of follow-up, types of intervention, and assessed outcomes. All but one study evaluating brief interventions had high risk of bias. No evidence was found on the effectiveness of brief stress management, relaxation, massage, mindfulness meditation, or multimodal interventions. We found limited evidence on the effectiveness of brief positive psychology interventions.Conclusions Our review highlights the need for high-quality studies evaluating brief mental health and wellbeing interventions in organizational settings. Future studies should use methodologically rigorous designs and improved reporting of methods and results to provide conclusive evidence on the effectiveness and sustainability of the intervention effects.","Ivandic, Ivana; Freeman, Aislinne; Birner, Ulrich; Nowak, Dennis; Sabariego, Carla",0,10.5271/sjweh.3616,1713

Within this body of knowledge, research investigating the effects of mindfulness interventions on employee health and well-being has strong practical implications for organizations. A sound understanding of the current state of the workplace mindfulness intervention literature will help inform the suitability of these interventions within the workplace domain, and how to improve the conduct and communication of intervention-oriented research. Accordingly, in this article, we systematically review 40 published articles of mindfulness interventions in the workplace to identify ways in which these interventions could be improved, and how to overcome methodological concerns that threaten study validity. Studies selected for review were published peer-reviewed, primary empirical research studies written in English, with a focus on a workplace mindfulness intervention. We discuss a range of issues evident within this body of literature, including conceptualizations of mindfulness; the adaptation of protocols to work settings; internal validity in relation to random allocation and control conditions; the use of manipulation checks; attrition, adherence, acceptability, and maintenance of interventions; utilizing objective cognitive measures; examining organizational and well-being outcomes; and establishing boundary conditions. Overall, this review provides a resource to inform scholars to advance this line of inquiry and practitioners who are considering implementing a mindfulness intervention for employees.

Studies with a pre-post design (i.e. without a control group) were excluded.Results24 articles were identified, describing 23 studies: 22 on the effects of MBSR and 1 on the effects of MBSR in combination with some aspects of MBCT. Since no study focused exclusively on MBCT, its effects are not described in this systematic review. Of the 23 studies, 2 were of high methodological quality, 15 were of medium quality and 6 were of low quality. A meta-analysis was not performed due to the emergent and relatively uncharted nature of the topic of investigation, the exploratory character of this study, and the diversity of outcomes in the studies reviewed. Based on our analysis, the strongest outcomes were reduced levels of emotional exhaustion (a dimension of burnout), stress, psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and occupational stress. Improvements were found in terms of mindfulness, personal accomplishment (a dimension of burnout), (occupational) self-compassion, quality of sleep, and relaxation.ConclusionThe results of this systematic review suggest that MBSR may help to improve psychological functioning in employees.","Janssen, Math; Heerkens, Yvonne; Kuijer, Wietske; van der Heijden, Beatrice; Engels, Josephine",0,10.1371/journal.pone.0191332,1716

Three electronic databases were searched for the purpose of this review over the 2000-2015 search period. The inclusion criterion was the influence of the selected form of therapy on reducing the risk of job burnout. Of the 235 selected articles, 22 met the inclusion criterion. In 77.3% of publications job burnout syndrome was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Researchers also used the De Utrechtse Burnout Schaal (UBOS) questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Dutch Version (MBI-NL), and their own questionnaires. The most commonly applied therapies were mindfulness and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Owing to significant differences in methodology between studies, it is difficult to attempt an objective comparison. In most studies (64.64%) authors managed to achieve the intended reduction of burnout. It is necessary that studies of burnout include research projects treating the study group in a multidimensional, biopsychosocial manner, taking into account biological and psychological factors with an accompanying social reflection.","Jaworska-BurzyÅ„ska L., Kanaffa-KilijaÅ„ska U., PrzysiÈ©zna E., SzczepaÅ„ska-Gieracha J.",0,10.12740/APP/65815,1717
2225,Promoting physical activity in the workplace: A systematic meta-review,"Introduction: Physically active (PA) people have a lower risk of various diseases, compared to those with sedentary lifestyles. Evidence on the effects of PA promoting programs in the workplace is large, and several systematic reviews (SR) and/or meta-analyses (MA) have been published. However, they have failed to consider factors that could influence interventions. This paper aimed to classify and describe interventions to promote PA in the workplace based on evidence from SR/MA. Method: A literature search for SR/MA was done using PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct (January 2006-February 2015). Quality assessment of SR/MA was performed using AMSTAR. The PRECEDE-PROCEED model was used for classifying the interventions into predisposing, enabling, reinforcing, environment, and policy domains of focus. Results: Eleven SR/MA included 220 primary studies, of which 139 (63%) were randomized controlled trials. Of 48 interventions identified, 22 (46%) and 17 (35%) focused on predisposing or enabling employees to have more PA, respectively. Of the 22 predisposing factors, 6 were information delivery, 5 were self-motivation, and 11 were program training. The enabling approaches were 12 instrument resources and 5 health service facilities. The reinforcing approaches were 4 incentive and 3 social support. The remaining interventions focused on the environmental development and policy regulation. Conclusions: This systematic meta-review classified interventions using appropriate framework and described the intervention pattern.","Jirathananuwat, Areeya; Pongpirul, Krit",0,10.1539/joh.16-0245-RA,1718
2227,Meta-analytic evidence of the effectiveness of stress management at work,"To increase employeesâ€™ psychological health and to achieve a competitive advantage, organizations are increasingly introducing flexible work arrangements (FWAs) and stress management training (SMT). This paper provides meta-analytic evidence of the effects of two forms of FWA (flexitime and telecommuting) and three forms of SMT (cognitive-behavioural skills training, relaxation techniques and multiple SMT) on employeesâ€™ psychological health, job satisfaction, job performance and absenteeism. Applying the conservation of resource theory, we conjecture that both FWAs and SMT improve all four employee-related outcomes. Quantitative meta-analyses based on 43 primary studies and 22,882 employees show that both FWAs and SMT are positively associated with psychological health and job satisfaction. However, due to a lack of primary studies we were mostly unable to analyse the effects on performance and absenteeism. Although we found a large heterogeneity in the hypothesized relationships, additional moderator analyses of study quality, age, gender, duration and intention of intervention yielded no significant effects. We discuss limitations and implications for practice and for future research.

2228,Computer-based versus in-person interventions for preventing and reducing stress in workers.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic exposure to stress has been linked to several negative physiological and psychological health outcomes. Among employees, stress and its associated effects can also result in productivity losses and higher healthcare costs. In-person (face-to-face) and computer-based (web- and mobile-based) stress management interventions have been shown to be effective in reducing stress in employees compared to no intervention. However, it is unclear if one form of intervention delivery is more effective than the other. It is conceivable that computer-based interventions are more accessible, convenient, and cost-effective.OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of computer-based interventions versus in-person interventions for preventing and reducing stress in workers.SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, NIOSHTIC, NIOSHTIC-2, HSELINE, CISDOC, and two trials registers up to February 2017.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled studies that compared the effectiveness of a computer-based stress management intervention (using any technique) with a face-to-face intervention that had the same content. We included studies that measured stress or burnout as an outcome, and used workers from any occupation as participants.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors independently screened and selected 75 unique studies for full-text review from 3431 unique reports identified from the search. We excluded 73 studies based on full-text assessment. We included two studies. Two review authors independently extracted stress outcome data from the two included studies. We contacted study authors to gather additional data. We used standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to report study results. We did not perform meta-analyses due to variability in the primary outcome and considerable statistical heterogeneity. We used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence.MAIN RESULTS: Two studies met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 159 participants in the included arms of the studies (67 participants completed computer-based interventions; 92 participants completed in-person interventions). Workers were primarily white, Caucasian, middle-aged, and college-educated. Both studies delivered education about stress, its causes, and strategies to reduce stress (e.g. relaxation or mindfulness) via a computer in the computer-based arm, and via small group sessions in the in-person arm. Both studies measured stress using different scales at short-term follow-up only (less than one month). Due to considerable heterogeneity in the results, we could not pool the data, and we analysed the results of the studies separately. The SMD of stress levels in the computer-based intervention group was 0.81 standard deviations higher (95% CI 0.21 to 1.41) than the in-person group in one study, and 0.35 standard deviations lower (95% CI -0.76 to 0.05) than the in-person group in another study. We judged both studies as having a high risk of bias.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found very low-quality evidence with conflicting results, when comparing the effectiveness of computer-based stress management interventions with in-person stress management interventions in employees. We could include only two studies with small sample sizes. We have very little confidence in the effect estimates. It is very likely that future studies will change these conclusions.","Kuster, Anootnara Talkul; Dalsbo, Therese K; Luong Thanh, Bao Yen; Agarwal, Arnav; Durand-Moreau, Quentin V; Kirkehei, Ingvild",0,10.1002/14651858.CD011899.pub2,1720
2229,Effectiveness of Workplace Interventions for Depression in Asia: A Meta-Analysis,"This meta-analysis is the first study conducted in Asia to quantitatively review the effectiveness of depression interventions in the Asian workplace. We identified 19 controlled intervention studies with a total sample size of 3,325 subjects representing different industry sectors in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, and South Korea. Interventions were coded as Cognitive-Behavioral, Multimodal, Alternative, Organizational, and Strength-Based, which were delivered face-to-face or mediated by a computer or telephone. Overall, the results of a pooled mean effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.417 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.257, 0.576]) revealed a significant and moderate positive effect of workplace interventions on the alleviation of depressive symptoms within the Asian workforce. This effectiveness could justify the increasing organizational need for investing in enhancing workplace mental health, as promoted by the World Health Organization. Moreover, ancillary moderator analyses in this study identified several key factors to further enhance the effectiveness of workplace interventions. Specifically, in addition to conventional cognitive-behavioral interventions, alternative and novel interventions with indigenous components and mediated interventions with interactive elements were found to have practical significance in the Asian workplace.","Lau, Rebecca W.

2231,The impact of mindfulness on well-being and performance in the workplace: an inclusive systematic review of the empirical literature,"Work can be demanding, imposing challenges that can be detrimental to the physical and mental health of workers. Efforts are therefore underway to develop practices and initiatives that may improve occupational well-being. These include interventions based on mindfulness meditation. This paper offers a systematic review of empirical studies featuring analyses of mindfulness in occupational contexts. Databases were reviewed from the start of records to January 2016. Eligibility criteria included experimental and correlative studies of mindfulness conducted in work settings, with a variety of well-being and performance measures. A total of 153 papers met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review, comprising 12,571 participants. Mindfulness was generally associated with positive outcomes in relation to most measures. However, the quality of the studies was inconsistent, so further research is needed, particularly involving high-quality randomized control trials.","Lomas, Tim; Medina, Juan Carlos; Ivtzan, Itai; Rupprecht, Silke; Hart, Rona; Eiroa-Orosa, Francisco Jose",0,10.1080/1359432X.2017.1308924,1722
2232,The effectiveness of controlled interventions on employees' burnout: A meta-analysis,"The aim of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of controlled interventions on reducing employees' burnout. Peer-reviewed published papers included in online databases, as well as papers identified in previous reviews, were considered for selection into the meta-analysis. Keywords entered were burnout and intervention, exhaustion and intervention, cynicism and intervention, and depersonalization and intervention. Inclusion criteria for the studies were (1) to include a burnout measure as a primary or a secondary outcome; (2) to include a comparison control group; and (3) available/sufficient data to calculate the d Cohen effect sizes. Using a random-effects model, we found small overall effect sizes for general level of burnout (d = .22, p < .05, k = 13, overall N control = 741, overall N intervention = 747) and exhaustion (d = .17, p < .01, k = 34, overall N control = 1,120, overall N intervention = 1,215), and statistically not significant effects for depersonalization (d = .04, p > .05, k = 31, overall N control = 895, overall N intervention = 888) and personal accomplishment (d = -.02, p > .05, k = 29, overall N control = 806, overall N intervention = 817). Similar effects were also found at follow-up, suggesting modest but lasting effects of interventions in reducing burnout. Yet, new more tailored strategies to reduce burnout are needed to improve the effects of the interventions.

2233,Effective and viable mind-body stress reduction in the workplace: A randomized controlled trial,"Highly stressed employees are subject to greater health risks, increased cost, and productivity losses than those with normal stress levels. To address this issue in an evidence-based manner, worksite stress management programs must be able to engage individuals as well as capture data on stress, health indices, work productivity, and health care costs. In this randomized controlled pilot, our primary objective was to evaluate the viability and proof of concept for two mind-body workplace stress reduction programs (one therapeutic yoga-based and the other mindfulnessbased), in order to set the stage for larger cost-effectiveness trials. A second objective was to evaluate 2 delivery venues of the mindfulness-based intervention (online vs. in-person). Intention-to-treat principles and 2 (pre and post) Ã— 3 (group) repeated-measures analysis of covariance procedures examined group differences over time on perceived stress and secondary measures to clarify which variables to include in future studies: sleep quality, mood, pain levels, work productivity, mindfulness, blood pressure, breathing rate, and heart rate variability (a measure of autonomic balance). Two hundred and thirty-nine employee volunteers were randomized into a therapeutic yoga worksite stress reduction program, 1 of 2 mindfulness-based programs, or a control group that participated only in assessment. Compared with the control group, the mind-body interventions showed significantly greater improvements on perceived stress, sleep quality, and the heart rhythm coherence ratio of heart rate variability. The two delivery venues for the mindfulness program produced basically equivalent results. Both the mindfulness-based and therapeutic yoga programs may provide viable and effective interventions to target high stress levels, sleep quality, and autonomic balance in employees.

2234,Meta-analysis of the effects of health promotion intervention in the workplace on depression and anxiety symptoms,"Objectives The aim of the study was to investigate whether different types of health promotion intervention in the workplace reduce depression and anxiety symptoms.Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature was undertaken on workplace health promotion published during the period 1997-2007. Studies were considered eligible for inclusion if they evaluated the impact of an intervention using a valid indicator or specific measure of depression or anxiety symptoms. The standardized mean difference was calculated for each of the following three types of outcome measures: depression, anxiety, and composite mental health.Results Altogether 22 studies were found that met the inclusion criteria, with a total sample size of 3409 employees postintervention, and 17 of these studies were included in the meta-analysis, representing 20 intervention-control comparisons. The pooled results indicated small, but positive overall effects of the interventions with respect to symptoms of depression [SMD 0.28, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.12-0.44] and anxiety (SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.06-0.51), but no effect on composite mental health measures (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.03-0.13). The interventions that included a direct focus on mental health had a comparable effect on depression and anxiety symptoms, as did the interventions with an indirect focus on risk factors.Conclusions When the aim is to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in employee populations, a broad range of health promotion interventions appear to be effective, although the effect is small.","Martin, Angela; Sanderson, Kristy; Cocker, Fiona",0,10.5271/sjweh.1295,1725
2235,Workplace mental health: An international review of guidelines,"The aim of this systematic review was to determine the quality and comprehensiveness of guidelines developed for employers to detect, prevent, and manage mental health problems in the workplace. An integrated approach that combined expertise from medicine, psychology, public health, management, and occupational health and safety was identified as a best practice framework to assess guideline comprehensiveness. An iterative search strategy of the grey literature was used plus consultation with experts in psychology, public health, and mental health promotion. Inclusion criteria were documents published in English and developed specifically for employers to detect, prevent, and manage mental health problems in the workplace. A total of 20 guidelines met these criteria and were reviewed. Development documents were included to inform quality assessment. This was performed using the AGREE II rating system. Our results indicated that low scores were often due to a lack of focus on prevention and rather a focus on the detection and treatment of mental health problems in the workplace. When prevention recommendations were included they were often individually focused and did not include practical tools or advice to implement. An inconsistency in language, lack of consultation with relevant population groups in the development process and a failure to outline and differentiate between the legal/minimumrequirements of a region were also observed. The findings from this systematic review will inform translation of scientific evidence into practical recommendations to prevent mental health problems within the workplace. It will also direct employers, clinicians, and policy-makers towards examples of best-practice guidelines. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

2236,A meta-analysis of health effects of randomized controlled worksite interventions: Does social stratification matter?,"Objectives The aim of this review was to assess what types of socioeconomic positions (SEP) are being considered in randomized controlled intervention studies and estimate the moderation of SEP in workplace intervention effects on body mass index (BMI), fruit and vegetable consumption, musculoskeletal symptoms, and job stress.Methods A meta-analysis of randomized controlled workplace interventions was undertaken. Studies were classified by participants' SEP. The overall standardized mean difference (SMD) for each outcome was estimated with random-effects models. Additionally, a random-effects model with SEP as moderating variable was calculated in order to assess intervention effect modification (EM).Results This review covers 36 studies. Altogether 40 reports of intervention effects were considered. The overall mean differences in the models, without SEP as moderating variable, were significant for all outcomes. BMI, self-reported musculoskeletal symptoms, and self-reported job stress decreased [SMD -0.16, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.29- -0.02, SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.51- -0.14, and SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.71- -0.04, respectively], whereas daily consumption of fruit and vegetables increased (SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-0.22). There were no statistically significant differences between occupational classes for the health outcomes considered (SMD -0.102,95% CI -0.264-0.060, EM -0.141, 95% CI -0.406-0.125; SMD 0.117, 95% CI -0.049-0.282, EM 0.000, 95% CI -0.230-0.231; SMD -0.301, 95% CI -0.494 -0.107, EM -0.369, 95% CI -1.169-0.430; and SMD -0.200, 95% CI -0.524-0.124, EM -0.598, 95% CI -1.208-0.012, respectively).Conclusions Workplace interventions can achieve small positive effects on major health outcomes. We could not confirm whether these effects are moderated by occupational class.","Montano, Diego; Hoven, Hanno; Siegrist, Johannes",0,10.5271/sjweh.3412,1727
2237,The influence of a mindfulness-based intervention on job satisfaction and work-related stress and anxiety,"Workplace mindfulness is a recognised tool for enhancing health and well-being of university staff and may result in better task performance and satisfaction in the workplace. The study examined the beneficial effects of mindfulness meditation on job satisfaction, mindful awareness and anxiety levels in university personnel. Mixed methods with a quasi-experiment and in-depth interviews were used. Fifteen participants engaged in a mindfulness meditation approach and five volunteers were interviewed. The findings showed a significant increase in awareness, with staying focused (t(14)Â =Â â€“3.09, pÂ =.00), noticing feelings of physical tension (t(14)Â =Â â€“4.00, pÂ =.00), being aware of running automatically (t(14)Â =Â â€“3.55, pÂ =.00) and not being preoccupied with the future or the past (t(14)Â =Â â€“2.69, pÂ =.01), respectively. Mindfulness was also effective in reducing sleep disturbance. Qualitative results demonstrated the mindfulness approach contributed to calmness and relaxation, and increased ability to handle difficult matters in the workplace. Apart from helping participants to better manage emotions, the mindfulness intervention could promote better relationships towards family members and reduce blood pressure to normal levels. Therefore, mindfulness meditation should be promoted across academic settings to enhance job performance and satisfaction and reduce work-related stress.

2238,Psycho-educational interventions designed to prevent deployment-related psychological ill-health in Armed Forces personnel: A review,"Background Employers such as the Armed Forces (AF) and emergency services, who predictably expose their staff to potentially traumatic events (PTEs), often provide psycho-educational briefings in an attempt to mitigate possible adverse psychological sequelae. Within the military, psycho-educational briefings are widely used, particularly following exposure to PTEs on operations. The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions and make appropriate recommendations.Method A search of Medline, PsycINFO and EMBASE was conducted, bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched and experts in the field were consulted.Results Two surveys and seven intervention studies were identified for inclusion in the review. Only three studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Overall, the review found some evidence of benefit of psycho-educational interventions but it was not consistent across studies or outcomes and effects were small. However, there was also little evidence to suggest that they caused harm. There was some evidence that the beneficial effects may be greater for those who have been exposed to a higher number of PTEs.Conclusions Given the high operational tempo currently faced by coalition forces personnel, there remains a pressing need to identify the most effective way of minimizing the impact of exposure to potentially traumatic deployment incidents. To date, few psycho-educational interventions designed to prevent deployment-related psychological ill-health have been evaluated systematically in methodologically robust studies. The review recommends that future interventions are theoretically based and evaluated in cluster RCTs that examine both process and outcome variables.

2239,Stress management in work settings: A critical review of the health effects,"Purpose. To review critically the research literature on the health effects of worksite stress-management interventions.Search Methods. Stress-management interventions were defined as techniques that are designed to help employees modify their appraisal of stressful situations or deal more effectively with the symptoms of stress. Stress-management studies that were worksite based, assessed a health outcome, and were published in the peer-reviewed literature were included in this review. The main search method was the one described in the lend article to this special issue of the JOURNAL, but supplementary sources included prior reviews of the research literature and expert contacts. Sixty-four studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review.Summary of Findings. A variety of stress-management techniques was used in worksite studies, including muscle relaxation, meditation, biofeedback, cognitive-behavioral skills, and combinations of these techniques. The most common techniques used were muscle relaxation, cognitive-behavioral skills, and combinations of two or more techniques. Outcome measures to evaluate the success of stress interventions included physiologic and psychologic measurements, somatic complaints, and job-related measures. Nearly three-fourths of the studies offered the training to all workers and did not specifically recruit high-stress employees. Over half the studies were randomized control trials, but only 30% conducted posttraining follow-up evaluations. The effectiveness of stress interventions varied according to the health-outcome measure used; some techniques were more effective for psychologic outcomes (e.g., cognitive-behavioral skills), whereas others were more effective for physiologic outcomes (e.g., muscle relaxation). Biofeedback was the least frequent technique used in work settings and also seemed to be the least effective technique. Meditation produced the most consistent results across outcome measures but was used in only six studies. In general, studies using a combination of techniques (e.g., muscle relaxation plus cognitive-behavioral skills) seemed to be more effective across outcome measures than single techniques.Conclusions. The large number of different stress-management techniques coupled with the wide range of health outcome measures used in stress intervention studies makes ii difficult to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of each technique and each outcome. Also, the quality of the methodology varied substantially among studies. Nevertheless, the most positive results across the various health outcomes were obtained with a combination of true or more techniques. None of the stress interventions was consistently effective in producing effects on job/organization-relevant outcomes, such as absenteeism or job satisfaction. To produce changes on these types of measures, stress interventions will need to alter or modify the sources of stress in the work environment. It can be said that stress management in work settings can be effective in enhancing worker physical and psychologic health, but the choice of which stress-management technique to use should be based on the specific health outcomes that are targeted for change.","Murphy, LR",0,10.4278/0890-1171-11.2.112,1730
2240,Process evaluation in occupational stress management programs: A systematic review,"Objective. To conduct a systematic review of workplace stress management intervention studies that have incorporated process evaluation.Data Source. Electronic databases such as PsycINFO and MEDline were searched.Study Inclusion Criteria. The inclusion criteria included interventions published in the English language that were focused on either individual- or organizational-level stress management interventions at the workplace, with an outcome evaluation.Data Extraction. Each article was coded on key process-relevant variables, including context, recruitment, reach, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity, implementation, and participant's attitudes toward the intervention. Studies that reported on at Least one of these process variables were also coded on the following study characteristics: participants, setting, evaluation design, intervention content, intervention format, and study outcomes.Data Synthesis. Statistical Package for the Social Science was used to analyze the data with descriptive statistics.Results. Of the 84 studies identified that met the study inclusion criteria, 52 (61.9%) reported findings on at least one of the key relevant process-relevant variables. Variables most frequently included were recruitment (30%), intervention dose received (22%), participants' attitudes toward intervention (19%), and program reach (13%). Fewer than half of the studies presented any findings linking process evaluation and outcome evaluation.Conclusions. The incomplete reporting of information relevant to Process evaluation makes it difficult to identify reliable determinants of effective intervention implementation or outcomes.","Murta, Sheila Giardini; Sanderson, Kristy; Oldenburg, Brian",0,10.4278/0890-1171-21.4.248,1731

2242,Controlled Interventions to Reduce Burnout in Physicians A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"IMPORTANCE Burnout is prevalent in physicians and can have a negative influence on performance, career continuation, and patient care. Existing evidence does not allow clear recommendations for the management of burnout in physicians.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to reduce burnout in physicians and whether different types of interventions (physician-directed or organization-directed interventions), physician characteristics (length of experience), and health care setting characteristics (primary or secondary care) were associated with improved effects.DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials were searched from inception to May 31, 2016. The reference lists of eligible studies and other relevant systematic reviews were hand searched.STUDY SELECTION Randomized clinical trials and controlled before-after studies of interventions targeting burnout in physicians.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. The main meta-analysis was followed by a number of prespecified subgroup and sensitivity analyses. All analyses were performed using random-effects models and heterogeneity was quantified.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The core outcome was burnout scores focused on emotional exhaustion, reported as standardized mean differences and their 95% confidence intervals.RESULTS Twenty independent comparisons from 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 1550 physicians; mean [SD] age, 40.3 [9.5] years; 49% male). Interventions were associated with small significant reductions in burnout (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.29; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.16; equal to a drop of 3 points on the emotional exhaustion domain of the Maslach Burnout Inventory above change in the controls). Subgroup analyses suggested significantly improved effects for organization-directed interventions (SMD = -0.45; 95% CI, -0.62 to -0.28) compared with physician-directed interventions (SMD = -0.18; 95% CI, -0.32 to -0.03). Interventions delivered in experienced physicians and in primary care were associated with higher effects compared with interventions delivered in inexperienced physicians and in secondary care, but these differences were not significant. The results were not influenced by the risk of bias ratings.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Evidence from this meta-analysis suggests that recent intervention programs for burnout in physicians were associated with small benefits that may be boosted by adoption of organization-directed approaches. This finding provides support for the view that burnout is a problem of the whole health care organization, rather than individuals.","Panagioti, Maria; Panagopoulou, Efharis; Bower, Peter; Lewith, George; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Chew-Graham, Carolyn; Dawson, Shoba; van Marwijk, Harm; Geraghty, Keith; Esmail, Aneez",0,10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.7674,1733

All quantitative study designs, including but not limited to randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, nonrandomized experimental trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies, were eligible.Data Extraction. Data extraction was performed by one reviewer using a standardized form developed by the researchers. Extraction was checked for accuracy and consistency by a second reviewer.Data Synthesis. Data in relation to the above objective were extracted and described in a narrative synthesis.Results. Seventeen studies were identified that focused on staff within the tertiary education setting. The review yielded overall positive results with 13 reporting significant health-related improvements. Weight loss, physical activity and fitness, and/or nutrition were the focus in more than half (n = 9) of the studies.Conclusion. This appears to be the first review to examine health interventions for tertiary education staff. There is scope to enhance cross-disciplinary collaboration in the development and implementation of a ""Healthy University'' settings-based approach to health promotion in tertiary education workplaces.

2244,Effectiveness of physical activity programs at worksites with respect to work-related outcomes,"This paper systematically reviews the literature on the effectiveness of physical activity programs at worksites with respect to work-related outcomes. A computerized literature search, a reference search, and a manual search of personal databases were performed using the following inclusion criteria: randomized controlled or controlled trial, working population, worksite intervention program to promote physical activity or physical fitness, and work-related outcomes. The study quality was evaluated using nine methodological criteria. Conclusions were based on a 5-level rating system of evidence. Eight studies (4 randomized controlled trials and 4 controlled trials) were identified, but their methodological quality was generally poor. The outcomes were absenteeism, job satisfaction, job stress, productivity, and employee turnover. The evidence of an effect was limited for absenteeism, inconclusive for job satisfaction, job stress and employee turnover, and nil for productivity. The scientific evidence on the effectiveness of physical activity programs at worksites is still limited. Because of the few high-quality randomized controlled trials, it is strongly suggested that this type of Study be carried Out. Future randomized controlled trials should pay special attention to the description of randomization, inclusion criteria, compliance, and analyses according to intention to treat.","Proper, KI; Staal, BJ; Hildebrandt, VH; van der Beek, AJ; van Mechelen, W",0,10.5271/sjweh.651,1735
2245,Overview of Outcome Data of Potential Meditation Training for Soldier Resilience,"In order to identify potential training to enhance comprehensive soldier fitness, this analysis searched MEDLINE via PubMed and elsewhere for 33 reasonably significant modalities, screening over 11,500 articles for relevance regarding soldier resilience. Evaluation of modalities that are exclusively educational or cognitive/behavioral in nature is deferred. Using the volume and quality of research over 40 parameters distributed among the five domains of resilience (physical, emotional, spiritual, social, and family life), these data allow culling of most of the meditative modalities and discrimination among the remaining techniques. The resulting order of merit is Transcendental Meditation, mindfulness, and progressive muscle relaxation. Transcendental Meditation, mindfulness, and progressive muscle relaxation, in that order, have the most supporting data. Fortuitously, they also represent a cross section of the domain of techniques regarded as meditation, stress management, or relaxation, with three very different mechanisms of action. They are suitable potential options for improving soldier resilience.","Rees, Brian",0,10.7205/MILMED-D-11-00067,1736

Twenty-four quantitative articles from PsycInfo and PubMed were identified that focused on mindfulness, self-compassion, psychological flexibility, stress, burnout, or psychological well-being. All MBSR and MBCT studies lacked active control conditions, but some of the ACT studies and one MSC study included an active control. Most studies support evidence that all training programs tend to improve mindfulness and some also self-compassion. In addition, psychological flexibility was measured in the ACT studies and tends to improve over time. Further, MBSR, MSC, and ACT tend to reduce stress or burnout. The results were less supportive for psychological well-being. The value of the various training adaptations as well as directions for future research are discussed.

2248,Systematic review of interventions for reducing occupational stress in health care workers,"Objectives This study evaluated the effectiveness of interventions in reducing stress at work among health care workers.Methods A systematic search was conducted of the literature on reducing stress or burnout in health care workers. The quality of the studies found was then appraised and the results combined. A meta-analysis was performed when appropriate.Results Altogether 14 randomized controlled trials, three cluster-randomized trials, and two crossover trials, comprising 2812 participants, were included. Only two trials were of high quality. The following comparisons were possible: person-directed interventions versus no intervention, person-work interface interventions versus no intervention, and organizational interventions versus no intervention. Person-directed interventions can reduce stress [standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.85, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -1.21--0.49] and burnout, measured as emotional exhaustion [weighted mean difference (WMD) -5.82, 95% CI -11.02--0.63) and lack of personal accomplishment (WMD -3.61; 95% CI -4.65--2.58). They also reduce anxiety, measured as state anxiety (WMD -9.42, 95% CI -16.92--1.93) and trait anxiety (WMD -6.91, 95% CI -12.80--1.01). Person-work interface interventions can reduce burnout, measured as depersonalization [mean difference (MD) -1.14, 95% CI -2.18--0.10]. Organizational interventions can also reduce stress symptoms (MD -0.34; 95% CI -0.62--0.06) and general symptoms (MD -2.90,95% CI -5.16--0.64). No harmful effects were reported. Conclusions Limited evidence is available for a small, but probably relevant reduction in stress levels from person-directed, person-work interface, and organizational interventions among health care workers. This finding should lead to a more-active stress management policy in health care institutions. Before large-scale implementation can be advised, larger and better quality trials are needed.","Ruotsalainen, Jani; Serra, Consol; Marine, Albert; Verbeek, Jos",0,10.5271/sjweh.1240,1739
2249,"Web-based interventions for the management of stress in the workplace: Focus, form, and efficacy","Objectives: This review sought to determine what is currently known about the focus, form, and efficacy of web-based interventions that aim to support the well-being of workers and enable them to manage their work-related stress. Method: A scoping review of the literature as this relates to web-based interventions for the management of work-related stress and supporting the psychological well-being of workers was conducted. Results: Forty-eight web-based interventions were identified and reviewed, the majority of which (n = 37) were ""individual""-focused and utilized cognitive-behavioral techniques, relaxation exercises, mindfulness, or cognitive behavior therapy. Most interventions identified were provided via a website (n = 34) and were atheoretical in nature. Conclusions: There is some low-to-moderate quality evidence that ""individual ""-focused interventions are effective for supporting employee well-being and managing their work-related stress. There are few web-based interventions that target ""organizational"" or ""individual/organization"" interface factors, and there is limited support for their efficacy. A clear gap appears to exist between work-stress theory and its application in the design and development of web-based interventions for the management of work-related stress.","Ryan, Cathal; Bergin, Michael; Chalder, Trudie; Wells, John S.

2250,The evaluation of stress management strategies in general practice: an evidence-led approach,"Recent surveys have highlighted sources of stress for UK general practitioners (GPs). Interventions to reduce stress in general practice have been introduced at both an individual and an organizational level, but there is little published evidence of their effectiveness. This paper systematically reviews the literature and reports that the research evidence from stress management programmes employed with other workforces is equivocal. Results so far suggest that relaxation and cognitive behavioural skills are helpful and that group methods are both more cost-effective and more beneficial than individual counselling. It is important for scientific, practical, and financial reasons that stress management programmes be properly evaluated. This paper suggests possible avenues for future interventions to alleviate stress.","Sims, J",0,,1741
2251,Effectiveness of online mindfulness-based interventions in improving mental health: A review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials,"Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are increasingly being delivered through the Internet. Whereas numerous meta-analyses have investigated the effectiveness of face-to-face MBIs in the context of mental health and well-being, thus far a quantitative synthesis of the effectiveness of online MBIs is lacking. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the overall effects of online MBIs on mental health. Fifteen randomised controlled trials were included in this study. A random effects model was used to compute pre-post between-group effect sizes, and the study quality of each of the included trials was rated. Results showed that online MBIs have a small but significant beneficial impact on depression (g = 0.29), anxiety (g = 0.22), well-being (g = 0.23) and mindfulness (g = 0.32). The largest effect was found for stress, with a moderate effect size (g = 0.51). For stress and mindfulness, exploratory subgroup analyses demonstrated significantly higher effect sizes for guided online MBIs than for unguided online MBIs. In addition, meta-regression analysis showed that effect sizes for stress were significantly moderated by the number of intervention sessions. Effect sizes, however, were not significantly related to study quality. The findings indicate that online MBIs have potential to contribute to improving mental health outcomes, particularly stress. Limitations, directions for future research and practical implications are discussed. Â© 2016 The Authors.","Spijkerman M.P.J., Pots W.T.M., Bohlmeijer E.T.",0,10.1016/j.cpr.2016.03.009,1742
2252,Efficacy of sleep education program based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy to alleviate workers' distress,"We conducted a randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of the sleep education program based on the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in reducing psychological distress among workers with insomnia. Total of 130 daytime office workers in Japan with insomnia complaints were randomly assigned to an intervention or to a control group. Intervention consisted of a 60 min group session and a 30 min individual session for sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and relaxation training. The occupational health physician of the workers' office led both sessions. The primary outcome was change in the K6 score for psychological distress between baseline and 3 months after the intervention. The secondary outcome was change in severity of insomnia measured with the insomnia severity index (ISI). Data were analyzed using linear mixed models with baseline value as covariates. A subgroup analysis was conducted among participants with clinically significant psychological distress at baseline (K6 score >= 5). Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis with multiple imputation showed that the effect size of the intervention was very small (0.10 for psychological distress and 0.20 for insomnia, respectively). However, subgroup analyses of high-stress individuals showed significant improvement in psychological distress (effect size = 0.37) and insomnia (effect size = 0.39). Our results suggest that 90 min sleep education program based on CBT-I principles led by an occupational health physician alleviated psychological distress in workers with insomnia complaints and high stress levels. Brief sleep education can be widely implemented to reduce distress in workers with insomnia.","Yamamoto, Megumi; Sasaki, Norio; Somemura, Hironori; Nakamura, Saki; Kaneita, Yoshitaka; Uchiyama, Makoto; Tanaka, Katsutoshi",1,10.1007/s41105-015-0045-3,1743
2253,Workplace Stress Management Interventions and Health Promotion,"Employee health and wellness are important for employees, their families, and their organizations. We review the literature on both stress management interventions in organizations and workplace health promotion and wellness programs, from the lens of primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions as well as the framework provided by the job demands-resources model (Bakker & Demerouti 2007). Stress management interventions tend to be ameliorative, often focusing on restoring resources that have been depleted by the work environment, whereas workplace health promotion and wellness programs tend to be more preventive, enhancing job and personal resources for all employees. There appears to be a trend toward incorporating stress management as a component of workplace wellness programs, with these programs taking more of a primary or secondary intervention approach than a tertiary approach. In addition, although organization-level interventions are still relatively rare, there is growing evidence that organizational interventions, especially when combined with individual-level interventions, can be quite effective in promoting a positive, healthy work environment. We conclude the review by offering suggestions for future research and some considerations for the design and evaluation of future interventions.","Tetrick, LE; Winslow, CJ",0,10.1146/annurev-orgpsych-032414-111341,1744
2254,Systematic review of universal and targeted workplace interventions for depression,"Depression is increasingly being recognised as a significant mental health problem in the workplace contributing to productivity loss and economic burden to organisations. This paper reviews recently published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of universal and targeted interventions to reduce depression in the workplace. Studies were identified through searches of EMBASE, MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES Full Text, and Global Health and Social Policy and Practice databases. Studies were included if they included an RCT of a workplace intervention for employees targeting depression as the primary outcome. Twenty-two published RCTs investigating interventions utilising various therapeutic approaches were identified. The cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) approach is the most frequently used in the workplace, while interventions that combine different therapeutic approaches showed the most promising results. A universal intervention in the workplace that combines CBT and coping flexibility recorded the highest effect size (d=1.45 at 4 months' follow-up). Most interventions were delivered in group format and showed low attrition rates compared with other delivery formats. Although all studies reviewed were RCTs, the quality of reporting is low. Interventions using different therapeutic approaches with different modes of delivery have been used. Most of these interventions were shown to reduce depression levels among employees in the workplace, particularly those that combine more than one therapeutic approaches.","Yunus, Wan Mohd Azam Wan Mohd; Musiat, Peter; Brown, June S.

2255,Burnout prevention: A review of intervention programs,"Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of intervention programs at the workplace or elsewhere aimed at preventing burnout, a leading cause of work related mental health impairment.Methods: A systematic search of burnout intervention studies was conducted in the databases Medline, PsycINFO and PSYNDEX from 1995 to 2007. Data was also extracted from papers found through a hand search.Results: A total of 25 primary intervention studies were reviewed. Seventeen (68%) were person-directed interventions, 2 (8%) were organization-directed and 6 (24%) were a combination of both interventions types. Eighty percent of all programs led to a reduction in burnout. Person-directed interventions reduced burnout in the short term (6 months or less), while a combination of both person-and organization-directed interventions had longer lasting positive effects (12 months and over). In all cases, positive intervention effects diminished in the course of time.Conclusion: Intervention programs against burnout are beneficial and can be enhanced with refresher courses. Better implemented programs including both person- and organization-directed measures should be offered and evaluated.Practice implications: A combination of both intervention types should be further investigated, optimized and practiced. Institutions should recognize the need for and make burnout intervention programs available to employees. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2256,Are workplace health promotion programs effective at improving presenteeism in workers? a systematic review and best evidence synthesis of the literature,"Background: Presenteeism is highly prevalent and costly to employers. It is defined as being present at work, but limited in some aspect of job performance by a health problem.Workplace health promotion (WHP) is a common strategy used to enhance on-the-job productivity. The primary objective is to determine if WHP programs are effective in improving presenteeism. The secondary objectives are to identify characteristics of successful programs and potential risk factors for presenteeism.Methods: The Cochrane Library, Medline, and other electronic databases were searched from 1990 to 2010. Reference lists were examined, key journals were hand-searched and experts were contacted. Included studies were original research that contained data on at least 20 participants (>= 18 years of age), and examined the impacts of WHP programs implemented at the workplace. The Effective Public Health Practice Project Tool for Quantitative Studies was used to rate studies. 'Strong' and 'moderate' studies were abstracted into evidence tables, and a best evidence synthesis was performed. Interventions were deemed successful if they improved the outcome of interest. Their program components were identified, as were possible risk factors contributing to presenteeism.Results: After 2,032 titles and abstracts were screened, 47 articles were reviewed, and 14 were accepted (4 strong and 10 moderate studies). These studies contained preliminary evidence for a positive effect of some WHP programs. Successful programs offered organizational leadership, health risk screening, individually tailored programs, and a supportive workplace culture. Potential risk factors contributing to presenteeism included being overweight, a poor diet, a lack of exercise, high stress, and poor relations with co-workers and management. Limitations: This review is limited to English publications. A large number of reviewed studies (70%) were inadmissible due to issues of bias, thus limiting the amount of primary evidence. The uncertainties surrounding presenteeism measurement is of significant concern as a source of bias.Conclusions: The presenteeism literature is young and heterogeneous. There is preliminary evidence that some WHP programs can positively affect presenteeism and that certain risk factors are of importance. Future research would benefit from standard presenteeism metrics and studies conducted across a broad range of workplace settings.","Cancelliere, Carol; Cassidy, J.

2257,"Effect of 12 weeks of yoga training on the somatization, psychological symptoms, and stress-related biomarkers of healthy women","Background: Previous studies have shown that the practice of yoga reduces perceived stress and negative feelings and that it improves psychological symptoms. Our previous study also suggested that long-term yoga training improves stress-related psychological symptoms such as anxiety and anger. However, little is known about the beneficial effects of yoga practice on somatization, the most common stress-related physical symptoms, and stress-related biomarkers. We performed a prospective, single arm study to examine the beneficial effects of 12 weeks of yoga training on somatization, psychological symptoms, and stress-related biomarkers.Methods: We recruited healthy women who had no experience with yoga. The data of 24 participants who were followed during 12 weeks of yoga training were analyzed. Somatization and psychological symptoms were assessed before and after 12 weeks of yoga training using the Profile of Mood State (POMS) and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) questionnaires. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), biopyrrin, and cortisol levels were measured as stress-related biomarkers. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the stress-related biomarkers and the scores of questionnaires before and after 12 weeks of yoga training.Results: After 12 weeks of yoga training, all negative subscale scores (tension-anxiety, depression, anger-hostility, fatigue, and confusion) from the POMS and somatization, anxiety, depression, and hostility from the SCL-90-R were significantly decreased compared with those before starting yoga training. Contrary to our expectation, the urinary 8-OHdG concentration after 12 weeks of yoga training showed a significant increase compared with that before starting yoga training. No significant changes were observed in the levels of urinary biopyrrin and cortisol after the 12 weeks of yoga training.Conclusions: Yoga training has the potential to reduce the somatization score and the scores related to mental health indicators, such as anxiety, depression, anger, and fatigue. The present findings suggest that yoga can improve somatization and mental health status and has implications for the prevention of psychosomatic symptoms in healthy women.Trial registration: University Hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN CTR) UMIN000007868.

2258,Lifestyle health promotion interventions for the nursing workforce: a systematic review,"Aims and objectives. Study aims were to identify the efficacy of lifestyle health promotion interventions intended to improve behavioural health risk factors and/or behavioural or clinical outcomes of working-age nurses. Background. Nurses constitute around half the health workforce but global shortages and an ageing profile challenge future supply. The occupational hazards and stresses of nursing are well known. Health promotion, possibly workplace-based, presents opportunities to safeguard the health of nurses. Design. This was a systematic review undertaken in line with guidance for reviews in health care. Methods. Seven electronic databases were searched from 20002011 and references of relevant papers. Two reviewers independently reviewed and critiqued retrieved papers and extracted data. Methodological features were described using the CONSORT checklists; risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook classification. Results. With design inclusion criteria relaxed to include an uncontrolled trial, only three intervention studies were retrieved, from the United States, Canada and Taiwan. All had limitations and high risk of bias, but benefits were reported. Outcomes included fewer cigarettes smoked during the intervention period, down from mean (SD) 20 (8)12 (9) per day (p < 0.001); significantly reduced fat mass (0.68 vs. 0.07 kg; p = 0.028); and significant gains across a battery of fitness assessments. The paucity of work focused on nurses health behaviours was the important finding. Conclusion. The workplace is a potentially fruitful location for health promotion intervention but nurses have seldom been recognised as a target participant group. Given the international priority ascribed to nursing workforce retention, this is a missed opportunity for occupational health planning. Potential benefits to nurses welfare and well-being may accrue from well-designed intervention studies. Relevance to clinical practice. Nurse leaders have a key role in driving recognition, spearheading commitment and development of targeted, whole-organisation programmes to promote health profile improvement for the nursing workforce.","Chan, Choi Wan; Perry, Lin",0,10.1111/j.1365-2702.2012.04213.x,1749
2259,Do workplace physical activity interventions improve mental health outcomes?,"Background Mental health is an important issue in the working population. Interventions to improve mental health have included physical activity. Aims To review evidence for the effectiveness of workplace physical activity interventions on mental health outcomes.Methods A literature search was conducted for studies published between 1990 and August 2013. Inclusion criteria were physical activity trials, working populations and mental health outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the Jadad scale.Results Of 3684 unique articles identified, 17 met all selection criteria, including 13 randomized controlled trials, 2 comparison trials and 2 controlled trials. Studies were grouped into two key intervention areas: physical activity and yoga exercise. Of eight high-quality trials, two provided strong evidence for a reduction in anxiety, one reported moderate evidence for an improvement in depression symptoms and one provided limited evidence on relieving stress. The remaining trials did not provide evidence on improved mental well-being.Conclusions Workplace physical activity and yoga programmes are associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms and anxiety, respectively. Their impact on stress relief is less conclusive.","Chu, A. H. Y.; Koh, D.; Moy, F. M.; Mueller-Riemenschneider, F.",0,10.1093/occmed/kqu045,1750
2260,Happy@Work: protocol for a web-based randomized controlled trial to improve mental well-being among an Asian working population,"Background: Mental health issues pose a serious concern in the workplace for the huge productivity loss and financial burden associated with it. Unlike the traditional 'fixing-what-is-wrong' approach, positive psychology offers a less-stigmatized way to promote mental health. Psychological capital, a concept originated from positive psychology, has been proven effective in improving mental well-being and work performance. However, little evidence exists for its implementation among Asian working population or its cost-benefit for organizations adopting such promotion strategy. The current study is designed to assess the protective effects of a web-based psychology capital intervention among Hong Kong working population on individuals' mental health and work performance, as well as organizations' return-on-investment.Methods/Design: A two-arm randomized controlled trial design will be adopted. Eligible working adults will be randomly allocated to either the intervention group or the waiting-list control group, with 177 participants in each arm. The intervention, which consists of four web-based training sessions, each targeting one of the psychological capital components (hope, efficacy, optimism and resilience), will be implemented over a 4-week period. On-line surveys will assess the participants in each group at baseline, intervention completion, 1 and 3 months after the completion. The primary outcome is individuals' psychological capital level; secondary outcomes include individuals' well-being, depressive symptoms, work engagement and productivity. Return-on-investment will be calculated from the employers' perspective based on productivity gain, savings in medical expenditure, as well as operation and time costs. Analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle.Discussion: This is the first experimental study that explores the applicability of psychological capital development among Asian population. Through investigating changes in individuals' work productivity from absenteeism and presenteeism, this will be one of the few studies that quantify productivity gains from any type of mental health promotion. By demonstrating effectiveness in improving mental well-being and a positive return-on-investment rate, the study may help convince more uptake of similar positive psychology interventions at workplace in Asia and elsewhere.","Yuan, Qi; Liu, Su; Tang, Szehang; Zhang, Dexing",1,10.1186/1471-2458-14-685,1751
2261,A systematic review of yoga for state anxiety: Considerations for occupational therapy,"Background. State anxiety can result from a variety of life situations. This type of anxiety can disrupt occupational engagement and performance, thereby affecting rehabilitation and recovery. Occupational therapists need to address the connection between mind-body-spirit and its relationship to performance and engagement in meaningful occupations. Yoga, when used as an adjunct to therapy, has the potential to address state anxiety. Purpose. The aim was to systematically review the evidence concerning the effectiveness of yoga as a treatment approach for state anxiety. Methods. Six electronic databases, the authors' own files, and the references of included studies from 1990 to July 2011 were searched. Findings. A total of 25 unique studies represented by 26 publications made up the sample: two systematic reviews; 16 randomized controlled trials, and seven prospective, controlled, non-randomized studies. Evidence suggests yoga can be a viable therapeutic option for reducing state anxiety in certain situations. Implications. In making the determination to recommend yoga as an intervention, occupational therapists should consider the client's circumstances and values as well as the type and intensity of the yoga program.","Chugh-Gupta, Neha; Baldassarre, Fulvia G.; Vrkljan, Brenda H.",0,10.1177/0008417413500930,1752

Seven randomised controlled trials and three prospective cohort studies assessing the effectiveness of a stress management programmes were identified and reviewed. The quality of research identified was weak. There is more evidence for the effectiveness of programmes based on providing personal support than environmental management to reduce stressors. However, since the number and quality of studies is low, the question as to which, if any, approach is more effective cannot be answered definitively. Further research is required before clear recommendations for the use of particular interventions for nursing work related stress can be made.","Mimura, C; Griffiths, P",0,10.1136/oem.60.1.10,1753
2263,Organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work-related stress in teachers,"BackgroundThe teaching profession is an occupation with a high prevalence of work-related stress. This may lead to sustained physical and mental health problems in teachers. It can also negatively affect the health, wellbeing and educational attainment of children, and impose a financial burden on the public budget in terms of teacher turnover and sickness absence. Most evaluated interventions for the wellbeing of teachers are directed at the individual level, and so do not tackle the causes of stress in the workplace. Organisational-level interventions are a potential avenue in this regard.ObjectivesTo evaluate the effectiveness of organisational interventions for improving wellbeing and reducing work-related stress in teachers.Search methodsWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ASSIA, AEI, BEI, BiblioMap, DARE, DER, ERIC, IBSS, SSCI, Sociological Abstracts, a number of specialist occupational health databases, and a number of trial registers and grey literature sources from the inception of each database until January 2015.Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, and controlled before-and-after studies of organisational-level interventions for the wellbeing of teachers.Data collection and analysisWe used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.Main resultsFour studies met the inclusion criteria. They were three cluster-randomised controlled trials and one with a stepped-wedge design.Changing task characteristicsOne study with 961 teachers in eight schools compared a task-based organisational change intervention along with stress management training to no intervention. It found a small reduction at 12 months in 10 out of 14 of the subscales in the Occupational Stress Inventory, with a mean difference (MD) varying from -3.84 to 0.13, and a small increase in the Work Ability Index (MD 2.27; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.64 to 2.90; 708 participants, low-quality evidence).Changing organisational characteristicsTwo studies compared teacher training combined with school-wide coaching support to no intervention. One study with 59 teachers in 43 schools found no significant effects on job-related anxiety (MD -0.25 95% CI -0.61 to 0.11, very low-quality evidence) or depression (MD -0.26 95% CI -0.57 to 0.05, very low-quality evidence) after 24 months. The other study with 77 teachers in 18 schools found no significant effects on the Maslach Burnout Inventory subscales (e.g. emotional exhaustion subscale: MD -0.05 95% CI -0.52 to 0.42, low-quality evidence) or the Teacher Perceived Emotional Ability subscales (e.g. regulating emotions subscale: MD 0.11 95% CI -0.11 to 0.33, low-quality evidence) after six months.Multi-component interventionOne study with 1102 teachers in 34 schools compared a multi-component intervention containing performance bonus, job promotion opportunities and mentoring support to a matched-comparison group consisting of 300 schools. It found moderately higher teacher retention rates (MD 11.50 95% CI 3.25 to 19.75 at 36 months follow-up, very low-quality evidence). However, the authors reported results only from one cohort out of four (eight schools), demonstrating a high risk of reporting bias.Authors' conclusionsWe found low-quality evidence that organisational interventions lead to improvements in teacher wellbeing and retention rates. We need further evaluation of the effects of organisational interventions for teacher wellbeing. These studies should follow a complex-interventions framework, use a cluster-randomised design and have large sample sizes.","Naghieh, Ali; Montgomery, Paul; Bonell, Christopher P.; Thompson, Marc; Aber, J.

2264,The Benefits of a Graduated Training Program for Security Officers on Physical Performance in Stressful Situations,"This study examined the benefits of a graduated training program for security officers on physical performance in stressful situations and identified predictors of effective coping with stress. In addition, a comprehensive model was developed to present the relationship between physical and psychological performance. Training effectiveness was determined by comparing the differences between performance under normal conditions and under conditions of stress in preintervention and postintervention phases. Measures included a battery of physical and psychological tests. Findings showed that training had a significant effect on performance. Stress had a negative effect only on performance of complex tasks, and this effect disappeared by the end of the course. The authors concluded that security forces can be trained to deal effectively with stressful situations.

2265,Exposure-in-vivo containing interventions to improve work functioning of workers with anxiety disorder: a systematic review,"Background: Anxiety disorders are associated with functional disability, sickness absence, and decreased productivity. Effective treatments of anxiety disorders can result in remission of symptoms. However the effects on work related outcomes are largely unknown. Exposure in vivo is potentially well fit to improve work-related outcomes. This study systematically reviews the effectiveness of exposure-in-vivo containing interventions in reducing work-related adverse outcomes in workers with anxiety disorders.Methods: A systematic study search was conducted in Medline, Cinahl, Embase and Psycinfo. Two reviewers independently extracted data and from each study assessed the quality of evidence by using the GRADE approach. We performed a meta-analysis if data showed sufficient clinical homogeneity.Results: Seven studies containing 11 exposure-in-vivo interventions were included. Four studies were focused on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), two on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and one on a mixed group of OCD and severe phobias. The studies were grouped according to type of anxiety disorder and subsequently according to type of comparisons. For OCD, exposure-in-vivo containing interventions can yield better work-related outcomes compared to medication (SSRIs) and relaxation but not better compared to response prevention. The results on anxiety outcomes were similar. The net contribution of exposure in vivo in two OCD intervention programs is also presented as a meta-analysis and shows significant positive results on work role limitations. The calculated pooled effect size with 95% confidence interval was 0.72 (0.28, 1.15). For PTSD, exposure-in-vivo containing interventions can yield better work-related and anxiety-related outcomes compared to a waiting-list but not better compared to imaginal exposure.Conclusions: Exposure in vivo as part of an anxiety treatment can reduce work-related adverse outcomes in workers with OCD and PTSD better than various other anxiety treatments or a waiting-list. We recommend that it should be studied how the results of these studies can be transferred to the practice of occupational health professionals and how clinicians can make better use of them to improve work-related outcomes. In future research, priority should be given to high-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which exposure-in-vivo containing interventions are applied to a variety of anxiety disorders and compared with other clinical anxiety treatments such as SSRIs. Work-related outcomes, in particular work functioning and sickness absence, need to be assessed with reliable and valid measures.","Noordik, Erik; van der Klink, Jac J.

2266,Psychosocial interventions for prevention of psychological disorders in law enforcement officers,"BackgroundPsychosocial interventions are widely used for the prevention of psychological disorders in law enforcement officers.ObjectivesTo assess the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for the prevention of psychological disorders in law enforcement officers.Search strategyCCDANCTR-References was searched on 12/5/2008, electronic databases were searched, reference lists of review articles and included studies were checked, a specialist journal was handsearched, specialist books were checked and we contacted experts and trialists.Selection criteriaRandomised and quasi randomised controlled trials were eligible. The types of participants were people employed directly in law enforcement, including police officers and military police, regardless of gender, age and country of origin, and whether or not they had experienced some psychological trauma. All types of psychosocial intervention were eligible. The relevant outcome measures were psychological symptoms, adverse events and acceptability of interventions.Data collection and analysisData was entered into Review Manager 4.2 for analysis, but this review was converted to RevMan 5.0 for publication. Quality assessments were performed. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of studies. Summary effects were to be calculated using RevMan but no meta-analyses were possible. For individual studies, dichotomous outcome data are presented using relative risk, and continuous outcome data are presented using the weighted mean difference. These results are given with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).Main resultsTen studies were included in the review but only five reported data that could be used. Three of the ten studies were related to exercise-based psychological interventions. Seven were related to psychological interventions. No meta-analyses were possible due to diversity of participants, interventions and outcomes. Two studies compared a psychosocial intervention versus another intervention. Three studies compared a psychosocial intervention to a control group. Only one primary prevention trial reported data for the primary outcomes and, although this study found a significant difference in depression in favour of the intervention at endpoint, this difference was no longer evident at 18 months. No studies of primary prevention comparing different interventions and reporting primary outcomes of interest were identified.The methodological quality of the included studies was summarised. No study met our full quality criteria and one was regarded as low-quality. The remainder could not be rated because of incomplete data in the published reports and inadequate responses from the trialists.Authors' conclusionsThere is evidence only from individual small and low quality trials with minimal data suggesting that police officers benefit from psychosocial interventions, in terms of physical symptoms and psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, cynicism, anger, PTSD, marital problems and distress. No data on adverse effects were available. Meta-analyses of the available data were not possible. Further well-designed trials of psychosocial interventions are required. Research is needed on organization-based interventions to enhance psychological health among police officers.","Penalba, Valentina; McGuire, Hugh; Leite, Jose R.",0,10.1002/14651858.CD005601.pub2,1757
2267,Preventing occupational stress in healthcare workers.,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers can suffer from occupational stress as a result of lack of skills, organisational factors, and low social support at work. which may lead to distress, burnout and psychosomatic problems, and deterioration in quality of life and service provision.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of work- and person-directed interventions compared to no intervention or alternative interventions in preventing stress at work in healthcare workers.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, NIOSHTIC-2 and Web of Science up to November 2013.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions aimed at preventing psychological stress in healthcare workers. For organisational interventions, interrupted time-series and controlled before-and-after (CBA) studies were also eligible.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. We used Standardised Mean Differences (SMDs) where authors of trials used different scales to measure stress or burnout. We combined studies that were similar in meta-analyses. We used the GRADE system to rate the quality of the evidence.MAIN RESULTS: In this update, we added 39 studies, making a total of 58 studies (54 RCTs and four CBA studies), with 7188 participants. We categorised interventions as cognitive-behavioural training (CBT) (n = 14), mental and physical relaxation (n = 21), combined CBT and relaxation (n = 6) and organisational interventions (n = 20). Follow-up was less than one month in 24 studies, one to six in 22 studies and more than six months in 12 studies. We categorised outcomes as stress, anxiety or general health.There was low-quality evidence that CBT with or without relaxation was no more effective in reducing stress symptoms than no intervention at one month follow-up in six studies (SMD -0.27 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -0.66 to 0.13; 332 participants). But at one to six months follow-up in seven studies (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.16; 549 participants, 13% relative risk reduction), and at more than six months follow-up in two studies (SMD -1.04, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.70; 157 participants) CBT with or without relaxation reduced stress more than no intervention.CBT interventions did not lead to a considerably greater effect than an alternative intervention, in three studies.Physical relaxation (e.g. massage) was more effective in reducing stress than no intervention at one month follow-up in four studies (SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.08; 97 participants) and at one to six months follow-up in six studies (SMD -0.47; 95% CI -0.70 to -0.24; 316 participants). Two studies did not find a considerable difference in stress between massage and taking extra breaks.Mental relaxation (e.g. meditation) led to similar stress symptom levels as no intervention at one to six months follow-up in six studies (SMD -0.50, 95% CI -1.15 to 0.15; 205 participants) but to less stress in one study at more than six months follow-up. One study showed that mental relaxation reduced stress more effectively than attending a course on theory analysis and another that it was more effective than just relaxing in a chair.Organisational interventions consisted of changes in working conditions, organising support, changing care, increasing communication skills and changing work schedules. Changing work schedules (from continuous to having weekend breaks and from a four-week to a two-week schedule) reduced stress with SMD -0.55 (95% CI -0.84 to -0.25; 2 trials, 180 participants). Other organisational interventions were not more effective than no intervention or an alternative intervention.We graded the quality of the evidence for all but one comparison as low. For CBT this was due to the possibility of publication bias, and for the other comparisons to a lack of precision and risk of bias. Only for relaxation versus no intervention was the evidence of moderate quality.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is low-quality evidence that CBT and mental and physical relaxation reduce stress more than no intervention but not more than alternative interventions. There is also low-quality evidence that changing work schedules may lead to a reduction of stress. Other organisational interventions have no effect on stress levels. More randomised controlled trials are needed with at least 120 participants that compare the intervention to a placebo-like intervention. Organisational interventions need better focus on reduction of specific stressors.","Ruotsalainen, Jani H; Verbeek, Jos H; Marine, Albert; Serra, Consol",0,10.1002/14651858.CD002892.pub4,1758
2268,Preventing the development of depression at work: a systematic review and meta-analysis of universal interventions in the workplace,"Background: Depression is a major public health problem among working-age adults. The workplace is potentially an important location for interventions aimed at preventing the development of depression, but to date, the mental health impact of universal interventions in the workplace has been unclear.Method: A systematic search was conducted in relevant databases to identify randomized controlled trials of workplace interventions aimed at universal prevention of depression. The quality of studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. A meta-analysis was performed using results from studies of adequate methodological quality, with pooled effect size estimates obtained from a random effects model.Results: Nine workplace-based randomized controlled trials (RCT) were identified. The majority of the included studies utilized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques. The overall standardized mean difference (SMD) between the intervention and control groups was 0.16 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.07, 0.24, P = 0.0002), indicating a small positive effect. A separate analysis using only CBT-based interventions yielded a significant SMD of 0.12 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.22, P = 0.01).Conclusions: There is good quality evidence that universally delivered workplace mental health interventions can reduce the level of depression symptoms among workers. There is more evidence for the effectiveness of CBT-based programs than other interventions. Evidence-based workplace interventions should be a key component of efforts to prevent the development of depression among adults.","Tan, Leona; Wang, Min-Jung; Modini, Matthew; Joyce, Sadhbh; Mykletun, Arnstein; Christensen, Helen; Harvey, Samuel B.",0,10.1186/1741-7015-12-74,1759
2269,Development of an Evidence-based Guideline for Supervisor Training in Promoting Mental Health: Literature Review,"Development of an Evidence-based Guideline for Supervisor Training in Promoting Mental Health: Literature Review: Akizumi TSUTSUMI, Occupational Health Training Center, University of Occupational and Environmental Health-Objective: To review published studies to assess the effects of supervisor training on the mental health of subordinate workers, and thereby develop an evidence-based guideline for supervisor training in promoting workers' mental health. Method: Seven studies that assessed the effect of supervisor training, whose outcomes included psychological stress responses of (subordinate) employees, were retrieved for assessment from PubMed, the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, the Web of Science, and Ichushi-Web. An additional five studies were also reviewed for discussion on the content and types of training. Results: Providing supervisors with necessary skills and information on mental health, including relevant occupational stressors, has a favorable effect on workers' mental health, at least in the short term. The subject populations had a background of requiring mental health measures. The effect of the training varied depending on the participation rate of supervisors, suggesting that the overall effect on an organization may be limited without a certain extent of participation by supervisors. There is no evidence of a long-term (over 1 yr) effect of supervisor training, and the effect of education on the supervisors' knowledge and behavior tends to be lost after 6 mo. Conclusion: The current evidence indicates that the following items should be taken into consideration for the development of a guideline for supervisor training: identification of high-priority populations requiring education, development of a strategy to improve the participation rate in education, inclusion of occupational stressors as well as basic information in workplace mental health teaching materials, and regular repetition of the program.

2270,Preventive staff-support interventions for health workers,"BackgroundHealthcare workers need to be supported to maintain sufficient levels of motivation and productivity, and to prevent the debilitating effects of stress on mental and physical well-being.ObjectivesTo assess the effects of preventive staff-support interventions to healthcare workers.Search strategyWe searched The Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group (EPOC) Specialised Register (and the database of studies awaiting assessment), Biblioweb (searched 28 August 2008); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3) (searched 28 August 2008); MEDLINE, Ovid 1950 to August Week 2 2008 (searched 26 August 2008); CINAHL, Ovid 1982 to August Week 4 2008 (searched 26 August 2008); EMBASE, Ovid 1980 to 2008 Week 34 (searched 26 August 2008); PsycINFO, Ovid 1806 to July Week 5 2008 (searched 27 August 2008); Sociological Abstracts, CBA 1952 to present (searched 28 August 2008).Selection criteriaRandomised controlled trials of interventions to support healthcare workers in coping with work-related stress, preventing burnout and improving job satisfaction, without changing contractual conditions of service or physical work environment. Three types of interventions were included in this review: (1) support groups for staff; (2) training in stress management techniques; and (3) management interventions for supporting staff.Data collection and analysisTwo authors independently performed study selection, quality assessments and data abstraction.Main resultsTen studies involving 716 participants met the criteria for inclusion. None assessed the effects of support groups for health workers. Eight studies assessed the effects of training interventions in various stress management techniques on measures of stress and/or job satisfaction, and two studies assessed the effects of management interventions on stress, job satisfaction and absenteeism.Three studies demonstrated a beneficial effect of stress management training intervention on job stress. Only one of these showed that this effect is sustainable over the medium-term. One study demonstrated the beneficial effect of a high intensity, stress management training intervention on burnout. Low and moderate intensity stress management training interventions failed to demonstrate benefit on burnout or staff satisfaction.Management interventions demonstrated increases in job satisfaction, but failed to show effect on absenteeism.Most studies had several methodological shortcomings leaving them vulnerable to potential biases.Authors' conclusionsThere is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of stress management training interventions to reduce job stress and prevent burnout among healthcare workers beyond the intervention period. Low quality evidence suggests that longer-term interventions with refresher or booster sessions may have more sustained positive effect, but this needs to be rigorously evaluated in further trials.Low quality evidence exists to show that management interventions may improve some measures of job satisfaction. However, further trials are needed to assess whether this finding is replicable in other settings. There was insufficient evidence of the benefit of management interventions on staff absenteeism.Rigorous trials are needed to assess the effects of longer-term stress management training and management interventions in primary care and developing country settings.","van Wyk, Brian E.; Pillay-Van Wyk, Victoria",0,10.1002/14651858.CD003541.pub2,1761
2271,The effectiveness of interventions in workplace health promotion as to maintain the working capacity of health care personal.,"BACKGROUND: The increasing proportion of elderly people with respective care requirements and within the total population stands against aging personnel and staff reduction in the field of health care where employees are exposed to high load factors. Health promotion interventions may be a possibility to improve work situations and behavior.METHODS: A systematic literature search is conducted in 32 databases limited to English and German publications since 1990. Moreover, internet-searches are performed and the reference lists of identified articles are scanned. The selection of literature was done by two reviewers independently according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction and tables of evidence are verified by a second expert just like the assessment of risk of bias by means of the Cochrane Collaboration's tool.RESULTS: We identified eleven intervention studies and two systematic reviews. There were three randomized controlled trials (RCT) and one controlled trial without randomization (CCT) on the improvement of physical health, four RCT and two CCT on the improvement of psychological health and one RCT on both. Study duration ranged from four weeks to two years and the number of participants included from 20 to 345, with a median of 56. Interventions and populations were predominantly heterogeneous. In three studies intervention for the improvement of physical health resulted in less complaints and increased strength and flexibility with statistically significant differences between groups. Regarding psychological health interventions lead to significantly decreased intake of analgesics, better stress management, coping with workload, communication skills and advanced training.DISCUSSION: Taking into consideration the small to very small sample sizes, other methodological flaws like a high potential of bias and poor quality of reporting the validity of the results has to be considered as limited. Due to the heterogeneity of health interventions, study populations with differing job specializations and different lengths of study durations and follow-up periods, the comparison of results would not make sense.CONCLUSIONS: Further research is necessary with larger sample sizes, with a sufficient study duration and follow-up, with a lower risk of bias, by considering of relevant quality criteria and with better reporting in publications.","Buchberger, Barbara; Heymann, Romy; Huppertz, Hendrik; Frieportner, Katharina; Pomorin, Natalie; Wasem, Jurgen",0,10.3205/hta000097,1762
2272,Randomized controlled trial of internet-based stress management,"This study investigated the effects of an internet-based self-help stress management program with a randomized controlled design. Of 85 participants, 26% dropped out, leaving a final sample of 63 participants with 23 in the treatment group and 40 in the waiting list control group. Treatment included applied relaxation, problem solving, time management and cognitive restructuring. All information and treatment interventions were provided via the internet. Results were evaluated with the Perceived Stress Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Improvements were seen in both groups, with greater improvements in the self-help treatment group. It is concluded that the internet can be used to provide stress management techniques and result in stress relief. However, spontaneous improvement, differential dropout rate and compliance need to be monitored in future studies.","Zetterqvist K., Maanmies J., StrÃ¶m L., Andersson G.",1,10.1080/16506070302316,1763
2273,The UK perspective: A review of research on organisational stress management interventions,"There are an increasing number of studies that have monitored the impact of Stress Management interventions (SMIs) and the results of these studies can play a vital role in informing the development of more effective, evidenced-based SMIs. In this paper, the authors have undertaken a review of United Kingdom (UK)-based research that has tested the impact of SMIs. Sixteen studies were examined and the results revealed that the vast majority of interventions were targeted at the individual employee, although there was a tendency for more recent research to focus on organisational level interventions. While all intervention levels were found to have some human and/or organisational benefits, strategies aimed at the individual level were less likely to result in longer-term benefits. An examination of the research methods used in the 16 studies indicated that UK-based researchers are beginning to adopt more rigorous research methods. However, there was a tendency for researchers to evaluate interventions over a relatively short time-frame. The implications of these findings for future research are discussed.","Giga, SI; Noblet, AJ; Faragher, B; Cooper, CL",0,10.1080/00050060310001707167,1764

2276,Stress management interventions for police officers and recruits: a meta-analysis,"Objective: A systematic review was conducted to examine the effects of stress management interventions on outcomes among police officers and recruits.Methods: The search methods included searching electronic databases, journals, books, conference proceedings, websites and contacting organizations and authors. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies, and any type of stress management intervention given to police officers, recruits or civilian law enforcement personnel.Results: The 12 primary studies included in the systematic review were published between 1984 and 2008 and included 8 published studies, 3 unpublished doctoral dissertations, and 1 unpublished report. The sample was comprised of 906 participants, with an average age of 34.48Â years, and an average of 10.77Â years of police experience. The average duration of the interventions was 10.95Â h with a range of 30Â min to 24Â h. A total of 221 effects were examined in a metaanalysis. Effect sizes were calculated separately for physiological, psychological and behavioral outcomes. The overall mean effect for physiological outcomes was 0.196, 0.038 among psychological outcomes, and âˆ’0.176 among behavioral outcomes. These small effect sizes suggest that the interventions were not effective.

2277,Stress and work-related upper extremity disorders: Implications for prevention and management,"Background A causal link between stress and work-related musculoskeletal disorders of the upper extremities (WRUEDs) has been established, but there is less evidence for a beneficial effect of stress reduction interventions on WRUED symptoms and incidence. Methods Searches of Medline, Ergonomics Abstracts, and Psychlit from 1990 to 2001 identified studies that either targeted stress and measured WRUED outcomes, or described other interventions with both stress and WRUED outcomes. Results Workplace interventions, including discrete improvements in technology, work organization and ergonomics, and more comprehensive approaches can reduce levels of stress. In a few studies, these interventions have been associated with decreases in WRUED symptoms. Similar effects are noted in stress-related interventions targeting individuals before WRUEDs have appeared, and at several stages of these conditions. Conclusions Health care providers can recognize stress-WRUED interactions through careful, directed inquiry. Both individual as well as workplace-targeted interventions, delivered in the primary care setting or workplace, may be helpful. Future research priorities include prospective studies of well-defined interventions, with ample measures of subject, intervention and workplace characteristics that can impact outcomes, and adequate follow-up to determine sustained effects.

Mindfulness-based stress reduction offers an effective way of reducing stress by combining mindfulness meditation and yoga in an 8-week training program. The purpose of this study was to look at studies from January 2009 to January 2014 and examine whether mindfulness-based stress reduction is a potentially viable method for managing stress. A systematic search from Medline, CINAHL, and Alt HealthWatch databases was conducted for all types of quantitative articles involving mindfulness-based stress reduction. A total of 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. Of the 17 studies, 16 demonstrated positive changes in psychological or physiological outcomes related to anxiety and/or stress. Despite the limitations of not all studies using randomized controlled design, having smaller sample sizes, and having different outcomes, mindfulness-based stress reduction appears to be a promising modality for stress management.

2281,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based and mobile stress-management intervention for employees: Design of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Work-related stress is associated with a variety of mental and emotional problems and can lead to substantial economic costs due to lost productivity, absenteeism or the inability to work. There is a considerable amount of evidence on the effectiveness of traditional face-to-face stress-management interventions for employees; however, they are often costly, time-consuming, and characterized by a high access threshold. Web-based interventions may overcome some of these problems yet the evidence in this field is scarce. This paper describes the protocol for a study that will examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based guided stress-management training which is based on problem solving and emotion regulation and aimed at reducing stress in adult employees. Methods. The study will target stressed employees aged 18 and older. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be applied. Based on a power calculation of d=.35 (1-Î² of 80%, Î± =.05), 264 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a six-month waitlist control group. Inclusion criteria include an elevated stress level (Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale-10 â‰¥ 22) and current employment. Exclusion criteria include risk of suicide or previously diagnosed psychosis or dissociative symptoms. The primary outcome will be perceived stress, and secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety. Data will be collected at baseline and seven weeks and six months after randomization. An extended follow up at 12 months is planned for the intervention group. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective and will include both direct and indirect health care costs. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol. Discussion. The substantial negative consequences of work-related stress emphasize the necessity for effective stress-management trainings. If the proposed internet intervention proves to be (cost-) effective, a preventative, economical stress-management tool will be conceivable. The strengths and limitations of the present study are discussed. Trial registration. German Register of Clinical Studies (DRKS): DRKS00004749.

This study examined the contribution of the nurse working in the PATHS program. Methods: A case study approach included in-depth interviews of PATHs program clients, stakeholders, and a documentation review. Results: Five themes emerged from the triangulated data: assessment and planning, personal and systems advocacy, persevering to the goal, the nursing approach, and respecting timing. Discussion: Program stakeholders valued the nurse's role in client assessment, risk analysis, ongoing client monitoring, and client coaching. Clients valued the nurse's work in supporting health literacy, joint health planning, advocating for timely provision of health and lifestyle behavior services as well as supporting, coaching, and prompting. Conclusion: These roles together with those of other PATHS team members have led to many clients successfully entering or re-entering employment.

Interpreting and understanding the impact of interventions in four similar worksites,"While many studies of interventions have focused on their content and immediate effects, less research has focused on the processes that may explain these effects. The purpose of this study was to show how process evaluation can be used to interpret the results of an intervention study in four industrial canteens in Denmark.

Effects were measured by surveys before and after interventions, and observations and interviews were conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of processes. Analyses were conducted based on the responses from 118 employees. Results showed, contrary to expectations, improvements in working conditions and well-being in one intervention group and in one comparison group, whereas no improvements were found in the two remaining groups. Data from the process evaluation enabled a meaningful interpretation of these results, raising the possibility programme failure rather than theory failure, and thereby constituting an example of how process evaluation can shed light over the factors that may influence outcomes in controlled intervention studies.

2284,A process evaluation of individual and organizational occupational stress and health interventions,"There is reason to believe that many health and stress interventions fail due to inattention to the effects of intervention implementation processes, but evaluations of these processes are found only rarely in the literature. The objective of the present study was to explore the issue of obstacles to implementation that may occur when stress and health interventions are introduced in work organizations. The study was conducted as a process evaluation of seven different individual and organizational interventions. Interviews were conducted in 22 post offices, 12 organizational units (such as care homes and local administrative units) of a Norwegian municipality, and in 10 shops in a shopping mall. The interviews took place before and after the interventions. The following key process factors were identified: (1) the ability to learn from failure and to motivate participants; (2) multi-level participation and negotiation, and differences in organizational perception; (3) insight into tacit and informal organizational behaviour; (4) clarification of roles and responsibilities, especially the role of middle management; and (5) competing projects and reorganization. For improved studies of interventions in the future we recommend that qualitative and quantitative methods be combined, that researchers build more on natural interventions that occur naturally within the organization, and that a pilot study be undertaken in order to investigate the cultural maturity of the organization.","Saksvik P.Ã˜., NytrÃ¸ K., Dahl-JÃ¸rgensen C., Mikkelsen A.",0,10.1080/02678370110118744,1775
2285,"Effect of individually tailored biopsychosocial workplace interventions on chronic musculoskeletal pain, stress and work ability among laboratory technicians: Randomized controlled trial protocol","Background: Among laboratory technicians, the prevalence of neck and shoulder pain is widespread possibly due to typical daily work tasks such as pipetting, preparing vial samples for analysis, and data processing on a computer including mouse work - All tasks that require precision in motor control and may result in extended periods of time spent in static positions. In populations characterized by intense chronic musculoskeletal pain and diagnosed conditions in conjunction with psycho-physiological symptoms such as stress-related pain and soreness and other disabling conditions, multifactorial approaches applying a combination of individually tailored physical and cognitive strategies targeting the areas most needed, may be an effective solution to the physical and mental health challenges. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the effect of an individually tailored biopsychosocial intervention strategy on musculoskeletal pain, stress and work disability in lab technicians with a history of musculoskeletal pain at a single worksite in Denmark. Methods/design: In this single-blind two-armed parallel-group randomized controlled trial with allocation concealment, participants receive either an individualized multifactorial intervention or ""usual care"" for 10 weeks at the worksite. Inclusion criteria: 1) female laboratory technician (18-67 years of age) and 2) Pain intensity â‰¥ 3 (0-10 Visual Analogue Scale) lasting â‰¥3 months with a frequency ofâ‰¥3 days per week in one or more of the following regions: i) upper back i) low back iii) neck, iv) shoulder, v) elbow and/or vi) hand. Exclusion criteria: 1) life-threatening disease and 2) pregnancy. Stress, as measured by CoheÅ„s perceived stress questionnaire is not an inclusion criteria, thus participants can participate regardless of their stress level. We will implement an individualized intervention addressing biopsychosocial elements of musculoskeletal pain with the following components; i) increasing physical capacity through strength- And motor control training; ii) lowering or preventing development of stress through mindfulness practice and learning de-catastrophizing pain management strategies through cognitive training. The primary outcome at 10-week follow-up is the between-group difference in intensity of perceived musculoskeletal pain during the last week (average value of back, neck, shoulder, elbow and hand) assessed by questionnaire (modified visual analogue scale 0-10). Discussion: This study will provide experimental evidence to guide workplace initiatives designed towards reducing chronic musculoskeletal pain and stress.

2286,Job stress management and ergonomic intervention for work-related upper extremity symptoms,"In practice the secondary prevention of work-related upper extremity (WRUE) symptoms generally targets biomechanical risk factors. Psychosocial risk factors have also been shown to play an important role in the development of WRUE symptom severity and future disability. The addition of a stress management component to biomechanically focused interventions may result in greater improvements in WRUE symptoms and functional limitations than intervening in the biomechanical risk factors alone. Seventy office workers with WRUE symptoms were randomly assigned to an ergonomics intervention group (assessment and modification of work station and stretching exercises) or a combined ergonomic and job stress intervention group (ergonomic intervention plus two 1-h workshops on the identification and management of workplace stress). Baseline, 3- and 12-month follow-up measures of observed ergonomic risks and self-reported ergonomic risks, job stress, pain, symptoms, functional limitation, and general physical and mental health were obtained from all participants. While both groups experienced significant decreases in pain, symptoms, and functional limitation from baseline to three months with improvements continuing to 12 months post baseline, no significant differences between groups were observed for any outcome measures. Findings indicate that the additional two-session job stress management component did not significantly enhance the short- or long-term improvements brought about by the ergonomic intervention alone.","Feuerstein M., Nicholas R.A., Huang G.D., Dimberg L., Ali D., Rogers H.",0,10.1016/j.apergo.2004.05.003,1777
2288,Effects of Resource-Building Group Intervention on Career Management and Mental Health in Work Organizations: Randomized Controlled Field Trial,"A resource-building group intervention was developed to enhance career management, mental health, and job retention in work organizations. The in-company training program provided employees with better preparedness to manage their own careers. The program activities were universally implemented using an organization-level, 2-trainer model with trainers from the human resources management and occupational health services. The study was a within-organizations, randomly assigned field experimental study; it investigated the impacts of the intervention on immediate career management preparedness and later mental health and intentions to retire early. A total of 718 eligible individuals returned a questionnaire in 17 organizations and became voluntary participants. The respondents were randomly assigned to either an intervention (N = 369) or a comparison group (N = 349). Those in the intervention group were invited to group intervention workshops, whereas those in the comparison group received printed information about career and health-related issues. The 7-month follow-up results showed that the program significantly decreased depressive symptoms and intentions to retire early and increased mental resources among the group participants compared to the others. The mediation analyses demonstrated that the increase in career management preparedness as a proximal impact of the intervention mediated the longer term mental health effects. Those who benefited most from the intervention as regards their mental health were employees with elevated levels of depression or exhaustion and younger employees, implying additional benefits of a more targeted use of the intervention. The results demonstrated the benefits of the enhancement of individual-level career management and resilience resources as career and health promotion practice in work organizations.","Vuori, Jukka; Toppinen-Tanner, Salla; Mutanen, Pertti",1,10.1037/a0025584,1778
2289,Capturing the Active Ingredients of Multicomponent Participatory Organizational Stress Interventions Using an Adapted Study Design,"Adapted study designs use process evaluation to incorporate a measure of intervention exposure and create an artificial control and intervention groups. Taking into account exposure levels to interventions combines process and outcome evaluation and strengthens the design of the study when exposure levels cannot be controlled. This study includes longitudinal data (two assessments) with added process measures at time 2 gathered from three complex participatory intervention projects in Canada in a hospital and a university. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the specific working mechanisms of particular interventions on stress outcomes. Results showed that higher exposure to interventions aiming to modify tasks and working conditions reduced demands and improved social support, but not job control, which in turn, reduced psychological distress. Exposure to interventions aiming to improve relationships was not related to psychosocial risks. Most studies cannot explain how interventions produce their effects on outcomes, especially when there are multiple concurrent interventions delivered in several contexts. This study advances knowledge on process evaluation by using an adapted study design to capture the active ingredients of multicomponent interventions and suggesting some mechanisms by which the interventions produce their effects on stress outcomes. It provides an illustration of how to conduct process evaluation and relate exposure levels to observed outcomes. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

2293,Sleep and cognitive failures improved by a three-month stress management intervention,"Work-related stress is a major occupational health problem. Prominent symptoms are impaired sleep and cognitive ability. Participants (N = 102) were randomized to either an intervention or a wait-list control group. Outcomes, measured at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, were the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire, Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, and Digit Span test. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analyses of variance. Self-reported quality of sleep improved in the intervention group. Relative to the control group, an effect size of d = -0.64, CI [-1.05, -0.24], was found. For cognitive failures, an effect size of d = -0.57, CI [-0.90, -0.24], was found, favoring the intervention. Gains were maintained at follow-up. Digit Span scores did not differ between groups. In conclusion, the intervention had medium effects on self-reported sleep and cognitive errors.

2294,Back pain in direct patient care providers: Early intervention with cognitive behavioral therapy,"Back pain and injury are a widespread problem for direct care providers and can lead to disability and job loss. Although most intervention studies focus on the number of reported injuries as the outcome variable, pain is a leading indicator of impending injury. More secondary prevention interventions focusing on early detection and treatment of pain are needed to reduce injuries. The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and effect size of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention to reduce the measures of back pain, stress, and disability in direct care providers working with back pain. The secondary aim was to assess the association between affect and outcome variables, particularly unscheduled work absence, which is a component of disability. This randomized clinical trial recruited 32 registered nurses and nursing assistants with a history of back pain in the past year and assigned them to either an intervention or a control group. The CBT intervention was a weekly stress and pain management session over 6 weeks led by a clinical psychologist. Data for both groups were collected at baseline and at 6 weeks, with work absence data caused by back pain self-reported for 12 weeks. Pain intensity scores declined in the intervention group, indicating a large effect. However, stress scores increased. Depression scores accounted for one-third of the variance in hours absent because of back pain. Although there was a high dropout rate in the intervention group, a cognitive-behavioral intervention shows promise as a secondary prevention intervention.
