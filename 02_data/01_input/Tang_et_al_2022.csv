2,Foundations of cognitive psychology,"In this chapter we try to answer the question, 'What is cognitive psychology?'. In so doing, we outline some of the foundational assumptions that cognitive psychologists tend to make, as well as some of the reasons why it is such an important and fascinating subject-not least the fact that it raises many deep and important questions concerning the mind. We consider some of the issues that have attracted and continue to attract the interest of cognitive psychologists, and some of the assumptions they make in order to develop models and theories. We also reflect upon the cognitive approach in general and the kinds of explanation cognitive psychologists favour, briefly considering the relations between cognitive psychology and other sub disciplines of psychology, and those between cognitive psychology and other disciplines (such as philosophy, computing, and linguistics). There are many substantial issues that we only touch on-it is not easy to define the relationship between two academic disciplines, for example-and so we only hope to convey something of their flavour here. Our aim in this chapter is therefore merely to introduce cognitive psychology, to explain some of its key distinguishing features, and to uncover some of the many broad issues lying beneath its surface. You will obtain a richer and more complete overview of cognitive psychology from reading subsequent chapters. You may find that the current chapter raises as many questions as it answers and that, as your reading of this book progresses, you periodically want to revisit this chapter to gain a better understanding of issues that, on first reading, seemed hazy. If this chapter only raises questions that you have in mind when you read subsequent chapters, and arouses your curiosity sufficiently that you periodically revisit it, it will have served its purpose well.

4,A note on stove and adding machine arrangement preferences as a function of sex and handedness,"In human factors classes and workshops taught over a period of 15 years (1984-1999) and in various locations throughout the United States we have used a stove (Fig. 1A) and adding machine (Fig. 113) exercise to illustrate some basic principles of human factors, Since handedness has been shown to be a significant variable in at least one human factors task (Chapanis & Gropper, 1968), we asked subjects to indicate their handedness and, as an additional variable of possible interest, their sex. This article presents the data we collected and summarizes briefly what the data show. The motivation for this study was our curiosity and not to test any hypothesis or theory.","Chapanis, A and Shafer, J B",0,,2
5,A ``Present'' for the Future: The Unexpected Value of Rediscovery,"Although documenting everyday activities may seem trivial, four studies reveal that creating records of the present generates unexpected benefits by allowing future rediscoveries. In Study 1, we used a time-capsule paradigm to show that individuals underestimate the extent to which rediscovering experiences from the past will be curiosity provoking and interesting in the future. In Studies 2 and 3, we found that people are particularly likely to underestimate the pleasure of rediscovering ordinary, mundane experiences, as opposed to extraordinary experiences. Finally, Study 4 demonstrates that underestimating the pleasure of rediscovery leads to time-inconsistent choices: Individuals forgo opportunities to document the present but then prefer rediscovering those moments in the future to engaging in an alternative fun activity. Underestimating the value of rediscovery is linked to people's erroneous faith in their memory of everyday events. By documenting the present, people provide themselves with the opportunity to rediscover mundane moments that may otherwise have been forgotten.","Zhang, Ting and Kim, Tami and Brooks, Alison Wood and Gino Francesca and and Norton, Michael I",0,10.1177/0956797614542274,3
7,Developing a Measure of Search Expertise,"While search expertise has long been considered an important variable in the study of online information search, the creation of a robust measure to characterize it has eluded researchers. Instead, those wishing to measure search expertise often include a single item that asks people to indicate how often they search or for how long they have been searching. In this paper, we report initial results of a four-phase study aimed at developing a measure of search expertise. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with nine professional searchers and an inventory of items related to online search expertise was created. While participants identified a number of usual items for determining search expertise, such as prior search experience, domain knowledge and resource knowledge, they also identified a large number of items related to personality characteristics such as persistence, flexibility, curiosity, adaptability and humility. These results suggest that measuring personality characteristics in addition to experience and knowledge might help determine who will be a more successful searcher. In today's search environments, where many people describe themselves as experts, representing these types of characteristics in a measure of search expertise might allow researchers and practitioners to observe more variation in populations of interest, design more effective instruction and make better predictions about search outcomes.","Bailey, Earl and Kelly, Diane",0,10.1145/2854946.2854983,4
8,Personality dimensions in animals,"Given the biological continuity between humans and other animals, it would seem obvious to ask whether there are dimensions of personality common to a wide range of species. Unfortunately, however, there is no unified body of research on animal personality that could answer this question; instead, the literature on animal personality is fragmented across the fields of agricultural science, animal behavior, anthropology, psychology, veterinary medicine, and zoology. My review of more than 70 animal-personality studies illustrates the breadth and diversity of the species studied, traits examined and methodologies used. Unfortunately, the methodological diversity of studies hampers attempts to compare them quantitatively. Thus, I present a conceptual integration of studies that have examined personality structure in 12 species, ranging from octopuses, guppies, and rats to gorillas and chimpanzees. This integration reveals some striking cross-species similarities, despite pronounced differences in observational and analytical methods. I next consider arguments against and in favor of cross-species generalizations and suggest three guidelines to facilitate a judicious approach to cross-species comparisons in personality psychology: (a) use appropriate species for the comparison of interest, (b) aim for converging evidence from several species, and (c) distinguish between the phylogenetic approach and the analysis of adaptation. Next, I present an empirical study of 34 spotted hyenas ( Crocuta crocuta) which found that (a) hyena personality traits were rated by four observers with reliabilities as high as in studies of humans, (b) five broad dimensions (Assertiveness, Excitability, Human-directed Agreeableness, Sociability, and Curiosity) captured about 75% of the total variance, (c) this dimensional structure could not be explained in terms of the animals' dominance status, sex, age, or appearance, and (d) as expected, female hyenas were more assertive than males. I conclude by proposing a research agenda for a comparative approach to personality that eventually can help understand the genetic, biological, and environmental bases of personality, as well as providing useful ways to examine personality change, personality types, and the formation of personality impressions. This agenda would complement, rather than replace, current research on human personality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Gosling, Samuel David",0,,5
9,A proposal for measuring interactivity that brings learning effectiveness,"It is proposed in this paper that some type of way to measure and visualize interactivity in the multimedia or e-Learning contents is necessary in order to clearly identify interactivity that brings learning effectiveness. Interactivity during learning will arouse students' intellectual curiosity and motivate them to learn further. Although the interaction in the communication between the teacher and his/her students in a regular classroom is ideal, it is not possible to maintain the equivalence in the multimedia or e-Learning contents. In order to rigorously formalize the field of measuring interactivity as a theory, theoretical constructs such as interactivity, interest, knowledge, and experience are redefined first. Then, the defined ""interactivity"" is broken down to subcomponents to develop an assessment tool for the interactivity which brings learning effectiveness. In the end, it is proved that the interactivity in learning can be measured.","Yamamoto, T",0,,6
10,"Mixing minds: Interpersonal relationships between Tibetan Buddhist Lamas and their western students, and psychoanalysts and their analysands: A study in contrasts","In the contrasting healing traditions of psychoanalysis and Buddhism, there is a shared belief in the potentially ameliorative impact of interpersonal relationship between designated healers and those seeking wellness. It is for this reason that both traditions, despite widely divergent methodologies and overarching purviews, privilege the process of revealing one's inner life to a primary healer. In this work the author examines how these intimate relationships between psychoanalysts and their analysands, and Buddhist teachers and their students, evolve and differ, with emphasis on the methods and end goals they consciously and unconsciously utilize. Through this comparative examination, this work seeks to encourage a growing interest in and respect for healing modalities that are unique to each tradition and healing couple. Through the psychoanalytic theories of Freud, Winnicott, Bion, Kohut, and Horney, the author examines how contemporary Western students steeped in both Eastern and Western traditions may experience relationship to their Buddhist teachers. The reader is asked to consider how such students may bring culturally specific psychological content to their Buddhist teachers. So too, the author explores the growing number of Western Buddhists who wish to examine their religious experience and relationship to Buddhist mentors, in their psychoanalytic healing efforts. The author proposes that these historically distinct traditions have begun mixing minds through this growing demographic of Western lay Buddhists who seek to examine both psyche and spirit in their respective healing journeys and relationships. Just as psychoanalysts and their patients, and Buddhist teachers and their students, exchange psychic content through their intersubjective experience, so too, these larger traditions have begun to cross-pollinate. This work searches for the boundaries of each tradition, so that practitioners and healers may consciously pursue their wish for healing with increased sensitivity to the limitations of any given healing system and relationship, and with an augmented curiosity for the methods and means through which healing transpires in the contrasting yet mutually informing worlds of psyche and spirit.

12,Insular cortex activity as the neural base of intrinsic motivation,"Many psychologists posit that intrinsic motivation generated by personal interest and spontaneous satisfactions is qualitatively different from extrinsic motivation generated by external rewards. However, the contemporary neural understanding of human motivation has been developed almost exclusively based on the neural mechanisms of extrinsic motivation. In neuroscience studies on extrinsic motivation, striatum activity has been consistently observed as the core neural system related to human motivation. Recently, a few studies have started examining the neural system behind intrinsic motivation. Though these studies have found that striatum activity is crucial for the generation of intrinsic motivation, the unique neural basis of intrinsic motivation has not yet been fully identified. I suggest that insular cortex activity, known to be related to intrinsic enjoyment and satisfaction, is a unique neural component of intrinsic motivation. In this chapter, I addressed the theoretical background to and empirical evidence for this postulation. <c2><a9> 2017 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Lee, W",0,10.1108/S0749-742320160000019016,9
13,STEM in fashion design: The roles of creative self-efficacy and epistemic curiosity in creative performance,"Integrated learning of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) has become a challenge in the field of technical education. To understand the effect of STEM learning, in this study, we first identified the components of STEM in relation to bag design, then asked students to learn STEM knowledge as they designed bags. In this context, we explored how learners' creative self-efficacy (CSE) related to two types of epistemic curiosity (EC) (i.e., interest type and deprivation type) and reflected the STEM knowledge they acquired and their creative performance (i.e., novelty, utility, and aesthetics). The data were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling. The results revealed that CSE was positively related to two types of EC, and knowledge acquired was positively related to creative performance. The indirect correlates between CSE and knowledge acquired, EC and creative performance, and CSE and creative performance were positively mediated by other constructs. The implication of this research is that integrating STEM into the study of fashion design can improve students' creative performance. <c2><a9> 2019 by the authors.","Hong, J.-C. and Ye, J.-H. and Fan, J.-Y.",0,10.29333/ejmste/108455,10

17,AN ESOTERIC PATH TO MODERNITY: RABBI JACOB EMDEN'S ALCHEMICAL QUEST,"This paper explores R. Jacob Emden's surprising quest for the knowledge of alchemy. This important eighteenth-century rabbinic leader searched for ancient books in the library of G<c3><b6>ttingen University, sought living experts and read original alchemical works in German. His sustained interest in alchemy reflects an historical phenomenon far deeper than his personal curiosity. By delving into his forgotten 1736 Igeret bikoret, comparing it to his other writings, and then contextualizing it within contemporary European medical discourse, I wish to use the quarrel between competing medical world views, so typical of the early modern era, to understand R. Jacob Emden's alternative, esoteric path to modernity and the specific ties it reveals between theology, law and medical practice. <c2><a9> 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Kahana, M",0,10.1080/14725886.2013.796154,13

Accreditation and Beyond Series, Volume I","Taking a Vygotskian perspective, this monograph focuses on the quality of interaction between children and staff in Australian child care and education programs. Aspects of quality interaction are presented through examples of interaction and through personal stories of staff analyzing their interactional patterns through video and audiotapes. Section 1, ""When Adult Talk is Quality Interaction,"" describes characteristics of quality interaction, focusing on the interaction's context, its temporal focus, children's level of interest, and the level of response required. Section 2, ""Establishing Common Knowledge,"" emphasizes seeking information from parents as a basis for interaction. Section 3, ""Listening to Children,"" highlights listening and responding to children and suggests using tape recording to analyze one's communication practices. Section 4, ""Positive Modelling,"" describes how one child care worker used a tape recording of his interactions to identify positive and negative statements, while section 5, ""Warm and Friendly Interactions,"" discusses using videotapes to analyze staff interactions with infants. Section 6, ""Children as Individuals,"" examines how a child-centered philosophy may obscure practices that promote highly gender-biased attitudes and behavior and how gender equity programs may counteract socialization of gendered behavior by children. Section 7, ""Staff Interact with Children to Stimulate Curiosity and Thinking,"" discusses scaffolding to interact with children in their zone of proximal development. Section 8, ""Socially Constructed Learning,"" lists characteristics of the staff role, the child role, and how learning is viewed. The conclusion section lists questions for self-analysis regarding staff interaction with young children. Contains 23 references.

20,The child as researcher,"Discusses the positive aspects of children's curiosity in which a constructive search for knowledge and sexual inquisitiveness are inextricably interwoven. Based on a longitudinal study by another author and 2 clinical examples from her practice, the present author demonstrates that the child's drive for research works in the interest of defensive-creative coping with anxiety. In 1 example, a 4-yr-old boy's restless research activity unfolds through the S's urge to constantly find and/or create something new to fill the aching void left by a lost inner object. The other example, a detailed observation of a 10-yr-old girl, shows her developing sexual curiosity in the context of gender difference, sibling rivalry, and oedipal conflicts.

21,``TO PUT IT SIMPLY'' - TEACHING THROUGH AND ABOUT SIMPLICITY,"In my talk, I will present the outline of an ESP (English for Specific Purposes) course for students of Information Design drawing upon John Maeda's book The Laws of Simplicity, illustrating how a text can be used in a threefold manner, as a source for information and ideas, as an example of language usage, and as the basis for developing and/or selecting teaching materials. The combination seems particularly attractive to future information designers, judging from the anonymous evaluations by students, who described the course as the best and most practically applicable English course they had taken so far. John Maeda's book The Laws of Simplicity suggests itself for an English course in Information Design as its author, a graphic designer and computer scientist, proposes ten laws for simplifying complex systems in business, life and product design. Not only is the subject matter of interest to students, it is also the unique correspondence of content and style of presentation that is appealing and also invites further investigation. My students were required to read the book and during lessons we discussed the content and the language used. Concerning the tasks I concentrated on oral work, vocabulary and grammar as well as autonomous learning by having students do research on certain questions. The exercises methodologically also vary between different teaching and learning styles. The variability in the approach is supposed to contrast with the topic of the course. I want to focus on the benefits the methodology I used offers for EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learning and teaching since the use of varying tuition methods fosters learner autonomy and motivation through interactivity and multimedia. Using subject-specific authentic texts clearly raised the learners' motivation which was further increased through fun in the activities, curiosity as the subject matter was of interest to students, multimedial learning material and social interaction. The learners were automatically involved in making choices and in modifying and adapting their goals which is typical of CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) classrooms. This constructivist approach to learning where the learners are offered content dependent possibilities promote learner autonomy and therefore guarantee a better outcome.","Koenig, M",0,,16

Having found that only three out of thirty of his students in his ""Assessment of Non-Fiction Texts"" course could successfully summarize a work in one paragraph with proper accents, submit it on time, and use a limited number of words that varied from one exercise to another, Jimenez became convinced that ""curiosity vanished from those twenty-something students of mine from the moment that Dr. Google began to answer everything immediately, right away."" He states his belief that these ""digital natives"" have lost the ability to concentrate, to be introspective, quiet... the ability to be alone. He made the decision to leave teaching because he felt he could no longer communicate with these digital natives.

24,CHALLENGE-BASED INSTRUCTION IN MEASUREMENTS AND INSTRUMENTATION,"This paper describes a newly developed Challenge-Based-Instruction (CBI) course for Measurements and Instrumentation (M&I) in mechanical engineering. This form of instruction relies on asking questions during lecture and is one of the best ways to incite curiosity among the students. This curiosity compels the students to find the answer to the question posed. The nature of the questions can propel them into a state of inquisitiveness and hence provide the instructor the right time and opportunity to present the course material. The CBI method of instruction thoroughly exploits this natural tendency with the goal of fostering committed and deeper learning rather than surface learning. For the M&I course, a series of challenge questions were developed. For example, the challenge question, ``How can you make a given paper glider glide the longest distance possible?'', can be used to introduce the concept of aerodynamic drag and hence lead to various ways in which aerodynamic drag can be quantified through pressure and velocity measurements. This challenge-question gives the instructor an opportunity to embed in the minds of students the importance and the concepts of pressure and velocity measurements. A series of such challenge-questions were developed for the various chapters in the syllabus of M&I. Several metrics were used to measure student learning including; homework, in-class-quizzes (both formative and summative), laboratory exercises, and midterm and final exams.

26,Mexican men's view of vasectomy,"The present study explored the views of Mexican men concerning vasectomy. One hundred and five men who had not had a vasectomy were asked to complete the following phrase ""If you no longer wanted to have more children and a vasectomy was suggested, you would react with . . . or you would think . . . "" with at least five different answers. Participants then had to rank each of their answers according to how well they describe the participant's feelings in the hypothetical situation. The results were analyzed using the Natural Semantic Networks Technique. The most common words used by participants with a limited educational background were reject, followed by fear and anger, and they did not use any words that implied acceptance of vasectomy. In contrast, the most common words used by participants with higher education were curiosity, followed by acceptance and interest; however, they also used the words fear and insecurity. The most frequent attitudes reported by men with limited education were negative, whereas participants with a higher education reported more ambivalent attitudes. These findings are discussed in light of sociocultural features and could be helpful in designing reproductive health programs with more effective counseling to diminish negative views about vasectomy.

This study examined the relationship between these two constructs within tourism settings. A survey strategy was employed in data collection that yielded 360 usable questionnaires. Findings indicate openness to experience to have a significant positive influence on the interest-type travel curiosity, while neuroticism and agreeableness to have a significant positive impact on the deprivation-type travel curiosity. Extraversion and conscientiousness had no significant effects on either of the two types of curiosity. The study affirms the applicability of openness to experience, neuroticism, and agreeableness in relating to travel curiosity.

31,"Engage, Investigate, and Report: Enhancing the Curriculum with Scientific Inquiry","Young children are called natural scientists for good reason. Even infants investigate their surroundings, using their senses to look, touch, smell, hear, and taste. As children discover objects and situations that are puzzling or intriguing--things that provoke their curiosity--they begin looking for ways to find answers, all in an effort to understand the world around them. This is the essence of the science inquiry process. Science inquiry refers to the diverse ways in which scientists study the natural world and propose explanations based on evidence gathered from their work. Early childhood is a critical period for science education, but only if educators use an approach that reflects young children's unique needs, interests, and abilities. While play and naturalistic investigations are important, it is equally important to discuss children's investigations to help them make sense of their observations and their thinking. The National Research Council (2005) recommends the use of an inquiry cycle of learning in science teaching to support the inquiry process. The science inquiry learning cycle can be a valuable tool for learning and may be instrumental in the development of long-term science literacy. This inquiry cycle approach includes five phases that support early childhood investigations. In this article, the author outlines the cycle using the example of an investigation of worms.","Blake, Sally",0,,22
32,Perceived parenting-style: Its central role in psychological adjustment and academic achievement of Argentinean students,"Parenting has been historically supported in cultural traditions. These customs used to rely on philosophical or religious values imparted generationally or by religious leaders. Recently the topic acquired a new scientific interest. This new found curiosity triggered a vast amount of studies on the subject. Since then, research on this matter has proliferated. Most of the questions aim to detect which parenting styles or practices function as protective factors of the individual's psychological adjustment or achievement in different areas - mostly educational ones. Which styles promote a better academic performance? Does perceived parenting relate to adaptive coping? How is parenting associated to social support? These are some examples of inquiries which are - with time - increasingly starting to get answers. This chapter discusses the effects of parenting on psychological well-being and academic achievement.

We argue that to become interested in complex novelty, it is key that people have a sense that they can cope with it. In three experiments we showed that people who have relatively high coping potential are more interested in complex novelty than people who have relatively low coping potential. Specifically, interest in complex novel products and inventions increased after increasing product-specific understanding (Experiments 1 and 2) and after inducing a more general state in which people can tolerate complex novelty (Experiment 3).

35,Review of Talking heads: The neuroscience of language,"Reviews the book, Talking Heads: The Neuroscience of Language by G. Denes (see record 2011-23177-000). The intersection of neuroscience and the study of language has produced the interdisciplinary field of neurolinguistics, which examines the language system as a biological system. This book seeks to summarize recent scholarship in this area. This book is best suited for linguists, experimental psychologists, neuropsychologists, and neuroscientists; but scholars of any discipline who are interested in language production and comprehension will find this book interesting. In the first chapter, Denes reviews the variety of positions and differences that would allow us to answer the two primary questions raised above, admitting that these questions cannot be currently resolved. In Chapter 2, Denes reviews the scholarly history (and scholarly interest) in the evolution of language. Chapter 3, ""The Anatomy of Language,"" provides a useful summary of the material before it. In this chapter, Denes explores the anatomo-clinical method and the presence of lesions and the work of Wernicke and others who studied language production as a result of different types of aphasia. The next seven chapters focus on aphasia, its types, and the remaining mysteries. The back matter of the book is devoted to an appendix of neuroanatomy, a very limited glossary, and an index. This book may be a useful reference for those situated more directly in the field of neurolinguistics but will not likely satisfy a general reader's curiosity about the field.

These two types of background music have comparable information loads, although they fit the exhibit to different degrees. Qualitative analysis of interview data indicates that background music played in museums has both emotional and cognitive influences on the visitor experience.

With each classroom example we include the challenges the teachers encountered and we make recommendations for inquiry-based instruction in elementary social studies.","Whitlock, Annie McMahon and Brugar, Kristy A",0,,30
44,Specific feelings,"The feelings are many and of many kinds, and they are intermingled almost inextricably. It would be difficult to make a complete list of them, and much more difficult to make a complete classification, if the list were made. The feelings are commonly divided into three classes: emotions, affections and desires. The emotions are simple feelings, as comfort, joy, etc. The affections are feelings that go out towards an object, as love, etc. The desires go out towards an object with the wish of possession, as a desire for food, money, etc. Each of these classes has its two poles, as they may be called; the emotions range from bliss, joy, happiness, down to sadness, sorrow, misery. The affections extend from profound love to the deepest hate; and the desires, from a passionate wish to possess, to a mortal aversion or dread. In each class, too, there is the feeling that results immediately from sense, and the higher feelings based on ideality, knowledge, or thought. After giving a more detailed analysis of affections, desires, passions, motives, and appetites, the author describes the work of the teacher to engage the sensibilities in learning. Some forms of sensibility that demand the teachers careful attention are: (1) love of self; (2) love of others; (3) love of country; and (4) love of beauty, truth, and right. It is the teacher's job to train the pupil's love. The author also considers the desire of society, the desire of power, the desire of approbation, and the emotions of curiosity, interest, admiration, reverence, sympathy, hope, and dread. No teacher should fail to recognize the grand principle of human nature: that the exhibition of any feeling is likely to awaken the same feeling in another.

45,Surveying the relationships between studentsâ€™ epistemic curiosity and their online academic help seeking behaviors in higher education,"This study initiated an attempt to explore the role of students<e2><80><99> epistemic curiosity, the desire to obtain intellectual information to fill the gaps in one<e2><80><99>s knowledge, in their online academic help seeking behaviors in higher education. There were 113 undergraduate and graduate students surveyed in this study. The results showed that the students had more experiences of searching information online and strong epistemic beliefs about seeking help when encountering academic challenges. It was also found that while the beliefs about perceived benefits from online academic help seeking might foster the students<e2><80><99> behaviors of information searching and formal query from teachers, their experiences of informal query from peers were significantly predicted by their perceptions of self-efficacy for seeking helps. There were strong significant relationships between the students<e2><80><99> I-type epistemic curiosity (stimulating intellectual interest) and their experiences of information searching. On the other hand, the students<e2><80><99> D-type epistemic curiosity (eliminating feelings of informational deprivation) was strongly related to their experiences of formal and informal query. Moreover, I-type epistemic curiosity may play a more important role in the students<e2><80><99> beliefs about online academic help seeking than D-type epistemic curiosity does. This study is still ongoing with larger sample for verifying the academic evidences. <c2><a9> 2019 International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.All right reserved.","Cheng, K.-H.",0,,32
46,An interest in fame: Confirming the measurement and empirical conceptualization of fame interest,"The following paper introduces and develops the conceptualization of Fame Interest. Study 1 (N = 1,978), through the use of factor analysis techniques, introduces the Fame Interest Scale which comprises six dimensions of Fame Interest (intensity, vulnerability, celebrity life-style, drive, perceived suitability, and altruistic) with evidence for the reliability and validity of the scale. Study 2 (N = 376) examined the relationship between an interest in fame and measures of the five-factor model of personality, narcissism, self-esteem, curiosity, attachment style and perceived family, and peer and media influence. From this second study four findings emerge; (1) Fame Interest typified by a perceived suitability and intensity for a celebrity life-style was associated with perceived family, peer and media influence, (2) Fame Interest that arises from a vulnerability is a reflection of neuroticism, low self-esteem, and problematic attachments, (3) Fame Interest for altruistic reasons is associated with agreeableness, and (4) Fame Interest that reflects an overall drive is associated with conscientiousness.

47,Unique and Shared Relationship Benefits of Consensually Non-Monogamous and Monogamous Relationships A Review and Insights for Moving Forward,"The increased media and public curiosity on the topic of consensual non-monogamy (CNM) presents an interesting case, given that these types of relationships are highly stigmatized. In the present review piece, we first situate common themes of benefits that people believe are afforded to them by their CNM relationships within the current state of the literature to provide insight into unique and shared (with monogamy) relationship benefits. This approach helps uncover relationship benefits and theoretical advances for research on CNM by highlighting some of the key features of CNM relationships that people find rewarding, including need fulfillment, variety of activities, and personal growth and development. Second, we discuss common misconceptions about CNM and stigma toward CNM. Finally, we conclude with future directions and recommendations for scholars interested in pursuing research on CNM.","Moors, Amy C and Matsick, Jes L and Schechinger, Heath A",0,10.1027/1016-9040/a000278,34
48,COMMENTARY ON STUDYING CIRCULAR QUESTIONING ``IN SITU'',"In their discursive study of circular questioning in a systemic family therapy session, the authors raise some interesting perspectives on the original Milan therapy team's guidelines for the therapist as the conductor of therapy. By emphasizing circularity from a discourse point of view, they suggest these guidelines can be used to help family members hypothesize about their own perspectives on themselves and the other family members in circular terms, and, drawing upon Cecchin's notion of neutrality, by creating a state of curiosity in their talk and maybe in their minds. Their emphasis on circularity also helps us to become more sensitive to ways in which the natural recursion in language can help us to appreciate the new guiding lines circular questions can suggest with previously spoken elements. If we follow this line of argument, then circular questions can be seen as a critical part of a therapy we can call recursive family therapy in which we use the recursive element of all natural living languages to help our clients to recursively change their language and lives naturally.","Chenail, Ronald J",0,10.1111/jmft.12003,35
52,Reflection in Learning through a Self-Monitoring Device: Design Research on EEG Self-Monitoring during a Study Session,"The increasing availability of self-monitoring technologies has created opportunities for gaining <c2><ad>awareness about one's own behavior and reflecting on it. In teaching and learning, there is interest in using <c2><ad>self-monitoring technologies, but very few studies have explored the possibilities. In this paper, we present a design study that investigates a technology (called Feeler) that guides students to follow a specific learning script, monitors changes in their electroencephalogram (EEG) while studying, and later provides visualization of the EEG data. The results are two-fold: (1) the hardware/software <c2><ad>prototype and (2) the conclusions from the proof-of-concept research conducted with the prototype and six <c2><ad>participants. In the research, we collected qualitative data from interviews to identify whether the prototype supported students to develop their reflective skills. The thematic analysis of the interviews showed that the Feeler's learning script and visualization of the EEG data supported greater levels of reflection by fostering students' curiosity, puzzlement, and personal inquiry. The proof-of-concept research also provided insights into several factors, such as the value of personal experience, the challenge of assumptions, and the contextualization of the data that trigger reflective thinking. The results validate the design concept and the role of the prototype in supporting awareness of and reflection about students' mental states when they perform academic tasks.","Durall, Eva and Leinonen, Teemu and Gros, Bego<c3><b1>a and Rodriguez-Kaarto, Tania",0,,36
53,You Can't Start Young Enough: Even a Kindergartner Can Be a Scientist!,"From the time they are born, children have a natural curiosity toward the world around them. Even though they can't speak, one can still observe that they are skilled at discovery. Science fair projects can nurture this natural curiosity and give elementary students the opportunity to explore their interests in a rewarding way. Participation in a science fair stimulates student interest in science while promoting the development of problem solving and decision making skills. Science fair projects help students understand how scientists work and foster closer working relationships among students, teachers, and school librarians. The basis for a successful science project is an unanswered science question. The Web site ""Skytopia"" provides students with a good starting point as they visually explore ""The World's Most Unanswered Science Questions."" ""Skytopia"" can be the motivation students need to think like scientists and explore unanswered questions on their own. As they seek to answer these ""unanswered questions"" they may be stimulated to read more, form hypotheses, and devise experiments to test their hypotheses. The result of continuing to seek answers to unanswered questions may be an idea for a new ""invention"" that can solve a common problem.

55,"Concepts, curiosity and careers","A theoretical framework is presented for explaining the development and modification of interests, values and attitudes as a basis for career planning. The foundation blocks are concepts derived from experiences which are associated with 1 or more of the basic human needs. Every concept has an affect charge or feeling tone determined by the instigating experience and appropriate need or needs. Interest, value and attitude concepts, the self-concepts and career concepts are evolved and modified through a complex process of generalization, abstraction and interaction of established concepts and affect charges and the continuous stream of new experiences and concepts. Certain principles and hypotheses regarding this developmental process are discussed.

56,Myaamiaataweenki eekincikoonihkiinki eeyoonki aapisaataweenki: A miami language digital tool for language reclamation,"In 1988, a young graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley began searching for materials on a little-known Algonquian language called Miami, which had ceased to be spoken sometime in the mid-twentieth century. Prompted by curiosity to describe this little-known language, the search uncovered two and a half centuries of documentation. This archival record would serve as the basis for the grammatical reconstruction of what is known today as the MiamiIllinois language, a central Algonquian language of the southern Great Lakes region. These materials are crucial not only to the reconstruction of Miami-Illinois, but also for the growing interests of Myaamia (Miami) people to reclaim their language and cultural heritage. The next twenty years proved to be a struggle in locating, duplicating, organizing and building a physical corpus of data for linguistic analysis and use in community revitalization. Language reconstruction from documentation requires tools for archival interaction and access that linguistically-based software and database applications lacked at the time. This prompted Myaamia researchers and language educators to seek out support for the construction of a digital archival database that met the needs of both tribal linguists and community culture and language revitalizationists. The first version of the Miami-Illinois Digital Archive (MIDA) became a reality in 2016 after support from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) was provided to Miami University's Myaamia Center to develop this unique research tool. This paper describes the challenges of working with digitized archival materials and how MIDA has filled the software tool gap between archives, linguists and revitalizationists.

57,Effects of multiple slip on flow of magneto-Carreau fluid along wedge with chemically reactive species,"Of concern in this work is an investigation of the heat and mass transfer mechanisms in the presence of first-order chemical reaction for an incompressible flow of non-Newtonian Carreau fluid model past a wedge. The hydromagnetic effects are also incorporated in the present study alongside the momentum, thermal, and solutal slips on the surface of the wedge. In addition to it, the impact of variable thermal conductivity is taken into account to explore the heat transfer characteristics of the flow field. The principal equations corresponding to the physical situation are transformed over to an arrangement of non-dimensional ordinary differential equations through local similarity variables. The numerical solutions of non-dimensional systems are acquired by enforcing fifth-order Runge-Kutta integration scheme and Newton's method with the assistance of broadly utilized computer software MATLAB. The curiosity of present investigation is that the shear stress and the fluid velocity are substantially raised by the magnetic parameter, while the temperature and concentration profiles are decelerated. Another interesting result is that the thermal slip parameter prompts the lessening of fluid temperature together with the rate of heat transfer. Furthermore, the present computations reveal that the concentration of the chemical reaction is observed to be a decreasing function of the Schmidt number and solutal slip parameter. Moreover, the suitable validations are presented to confirm the achieved results accuracy.","Khan, Masood and Hashim",0,10.1007/s00521-016-2825-3,40

Arnold Cooper welcomes this change with open arms. Positive phrases abound: ""The flowering of ideas: our willingness to embrace new ideas and new research efforts""; ""the magnitude of innovation and experimentation that is now acceptable""; ""have released great bursts of creativity""; ""ideas and practices that were considered heretical just a few years ago are today accepted or at least seriously considered within the mainstream."" Cooper meets this daunting task by asking 30 established leaders in the field to contribute the paper they each thought best represented his or her current thinking or his or her major contribution. A brilliant detailed introduction helps to guide the reader to areas of interest. Two authors, attempt an overview of the different theoretical persuasions in our field with a hope of achieving some integration or at least highlighting some convergences.

59,The solar eclipse in Calcutta (1980): A psychophysiological study with human subjects,"Recorded skin conductance (SC) as a measure of anxiety and tension in 4 male undergraduates of Calcutta University (20-24 yrs old) before, during, and after the total solar eclipse of February 16, 1980; as the 1st such eclipse since 1898, it aroused much interest, curiosity, and panic. Two Ss were in the exposed (E) condition-i.e., they were allowed to walk about the campus at will, viewing the eclipse directly; 2 were in the nonexposed (NE) condition, confined to a room that was illuminated but had no view of the outdoors. Ss also gave introspective reports on their feelings at the times when SC was recorded. The E group showed higher SC during the eclipse than the NE group, and introspective reports were related fairly closely to the physiological recordings.

62,The enthusiastic teaching - the actor's art didactically transposed for teachers,"To be teacher is undoubtedly the most important and noble profession of humanity because it has direct access to the children's soul and the entire human evolution depends on the efforts of the educators. For this job it is not enough to study three years at the faculty; it takes a long and a lot of dedication, for life. You must have inside, in the heart, in the soul, something like a calling, which makes students listen to you. Teacher's concern regarding the needs of student it is not only to make him understand the science but also to make him feel the excitement to studying it. To be a good teacher requires being a good actor in the classroom, to be able to convey to the students emotion and desire to learn more about certain content. It is important the way in which the teacher manages to stimulate the curiosity and maintain the students' interest in living the joy of personal discoveries. The way he communicates with the student and using appropriate methods and techniques to stimulate creativity, the teacher may attract his interest, his curiosity and Ins desire for knowledge. The enthusiasm of the teacher is the key for a good learning in school. This arouses the student interest, maintains his attention and positive attitude. In this way, there is an increase in student motivation which influences the performance, good results obtained by the student learning in the process. (C) 2013 The Authors.

63,Conor: Hold on or you'll fall: The struggle to become an ordinary boy,"Describes the emergence from a state of mindlessness of a 3-yr-old male patient over 6 yrs of psychotherapy. The author depicts the central conflicts of his disorder and conveys some of the quality of the experience of working with the S. The S uses the concept of skin as a boundary and then as a container as an interest in being with people with depth and structure. The author discusses the S's curiosity and frustration of coming into the world of human relationships. The emergence from the autistic state, the S's increased capacity to tolerate mental pain and frustration and its accompanying problems, and the S's struggle to be ordinary and independent are also discussed. Though the S lags behind in his emotional and cognitive age, he makes significant progress through treatment and the strength of his autism is reduced considerably as he makes a successful relationship to his world.

He doesn't seem to find interest in the toys or activities available to him. Sandy is three years old. Most of the time, she seems oblivious to the rules and routines of her care center. When she arrives in the morning, she throws her coat on the floor instead of hanging it in her cubby. She refuses to respond appropriately to the cleanup signal. She rarely smiles or laughs, nor does she make eye contact with her teachers or peers. She is unusually attached, however, to one caregiver and attempts to stay close to that person whenever she can. However, the social interaction between the two is limited by Sandy's reluctance to communicate despite the efforts of the caregiver. Laurie, age four and a half, has a violent temper.

66,Follow your heart: An exploration of the somatic knowing of one's calling,"People desire the satisfaction and happiness that comes from finding one's call, purpose, meaning, or vocation. This pursuit is of great interest and many people seek out therapy to find the meaning in their lives. They seek their own personal calling, the task or path they feel they were meant to complete or follow. Without it, one is overwhelmed by a deep sense of meaninglessness (Hillman, 1996). Others need not seek calling, for they have already recognized it. When asked about this experience, they often refer to a bodily experience. They say they ""followed their heart,"" ""heard the call,"" or ""felt it in their gut."" The language used to describe the discovery of one's purpose is frequently focused around somatic experiences such as symptoms, bodily sensations, dreams, intuitions, synchronicities, or visions. The purpose of this study was to gain a deeper understanding of the somatic knowing of one's calling. A combination of two approaches and two methods was used in this study: a phenomenological approach with its use of qualitative research methods allowing for the investigation of immeasurable and unquantifiable data and an imaginal approach with its process of transference dialogues and the alchemical hermeneutic method. Two male and 2 female participants between the ages of 32 and 75 were interviewed about the somatic knowing of their calling. There were 11 common themes discovered in their experiences: specific bodily experience, receptivity, synchronicity, feels good, curiosity, loneliness, soul, who I am, evolution, mentors, and gratitude. The results of this research support the notion that every person has a unique call and recognizing how psyche/soma reveals this call can offer a source of joy and health. The results ask one to place value in discovering what brings joy, not by avoiding troubling or dangerous symptoms but by adding meaning and purpose to the story. One is encouraged to become curious of the myth that is his or her life. Exploring one's soul history makes meaning of life experiences and connects one to his or her true self, soul, and to a source of truth and healing. Key words: body, somatic, vocation, calling.

With the proliferation of conferences, it becomes harder to book the venue we want, at the time we want. An alternative would be jointly planned conferences, which deliberately capitalize on the opportunity to allow people from two different fields to mingle, talk together, share presentations and learn from each other. On the third day of next year's Melbourne conference, we shall be sharing facilities with Gestaltists. It would be good if the organizers allow family therapists the freedom to sneak into Gestalt sessions (and vice versa) and encourage two-way curiosity! Reflecting our culture, family therapy tends to act like a nuclear family cut off from other family members.

Preliminary findings on one type of project-based learning in which students take on the role of hypermedia designers support this claim. This study examined the effect of being hypermedia designers on fourth-graders' motivation and learning of design knowledge. Both quantitative (motivation scale, design questionnaire, task ranking, HyperStudio tests, and analysis of student-created programs) and qualitative data (observations, response log entries, and interview) were collected. The findings showed that engaging students in hypermedia authoring could enhance their motivation, and allowing students to be hypermedia designers could support the development of design knowledge and higher order thinking skills. The skills most affected in this study included planning, presentation, reflection, collaboration, task distribution, and time management. Three tables presents data on: motivation, including measures of challenge, curiosity, mastery, judgment, and criteria; design skills, including categories of audience, presenting, planning, interest, mental effort, and collaboration; and the importance of the design tasks ranked by the students.

The connectionbetween the digital and cultural domains brought a new approach to learning which reveals in activities where space and time vanish, giving rise to a new relationship between an individual and culture. The digital world, offering many potentialities and chances, enters in the museum, bringing substantial changes permitting new experiences of living and perceiving exhibition places, stimulating interest, curiosity, imagination and emotions of the users. This is possible through the use of innovative ways to communicate with people using a more extensive advertising that can reach a wide audienceand through the creation of attractive and smart websites that allow access to collections through interactive guided tours in all languages, consultation of databases, 3D reconstructions of environments, educational section dedicated to children and students, online meeting with experts and assistants.

75,Children's questions and their implications for planning the curriculum,"In the belief that schools will best satisfy ""mind hunger"" and provide the most valuable form of education by providing information in the areas of knowledge about which children express curiosity, the author collected 9,280 questions from 1,402 children in grades 3-6 in 16 cities. The questions were analyzed by content and the implications of the results considered. Nearly 50% of the questions concerned the area of social studies; about 8%, current events; nearly 38%, scientific information; and less than 4% concerned the local communities. The author concludes that graduates of a teachers college should possess a rich background in social studies and in the biological sciences. Schools should stimulate the pupils' interest in their immediate surroundings and in the current problems of their own communities.

76,Elementary Voices of City Teachers: Historic Perspectives and Contemporary Meanings 1964-2014,"Responding to historic silence in research regarding teacher work in classrooms, this dissertation examines professional experience and meaning making of four teachers who worked in city elementary schools between the years of 1964-2014. The lives of teachers working on the scene adds texture to the landscape of educational research and reform. Utilizing the investigational framework of Oral history supported by generic utilization of ""history-telling,"" research includes three ninety-minute recorded interviews and one-hour member check with each participant, transcribing of data, coding of data, and generic representation. Findings include: perceptions of narrowed professional opportunities based on gender, curiosity and interest as to what might have been, challenges in early stages of career, lack of material support for teaching, uncaring and incompetent administrators, inadequate teaching space, assignation of menial duties unrelated to teaching, lack of in school preparation time, and isolation from colleagues. Implications are identified for utilization of genre as it informs of ""life 'and' times"" of teachers. Additional implications emerge for further use of genre for use by educational researchers, teachers, teacher-educators, parents, school administrators, and policymakers.

77,"Synchrony lost, synchrony regained: The achievement of musical co-ordination","As part of a series of Ethnomethodological Studies of Work, this paper focusses upon a short stretch of a final concert performance of the Saint-Saens Septet by a set of amateur musicians in which timing errors occur but in response to which various manoeuvres 'successfully' restore synchrony. I set out to demonstrate that these afford a strategic access for ethnomethodologists to sets of musicians' practices whereby musical synchrony is ongoingly accomplished. The central curiosity of this study is the set of distinctive practices whereby a musical text set out in a spatial, linear sequence of markings is realized in a collective performance that unfolds not only in precise time values but also in synchrony. This paper analyzes three errors in a short passage and the ways in which they are 'corrected' either by the errant musician himself or by the other musician in response. In these cases, the restoration of synchrony and the routine performance of the piece thereafter are accomplished successfully in the sense that those listening to the tape of it generally fail to notice any problem! This contrasts to my detection of problems during both my participation in the performance and repeated listening of the resulting audio-tape, I argue that it is this systematic difference in possible hearings that musicians are oriented to when attempting to 'fake it'. Thus, the essential interest is in members' methods for maintaining as well as restoring synchrony. What can we retrieve of members' in situ, embodied practices where talk is absent from a close description of the resultant order, the details of the musical performance? I claim that Schegloff s stipulated requirement that CA ground its claims in the details of the talk is not appropriate for the study of music. In contrast with conversation in which we are competent participants, one requires musicians' insider knowledge in order to recover just what members are doing. Repeated listening is not enough. <c2><a9> 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Weeks, P",0,10.1007/BF00131494,56
78,"Review of Learning science in informal environments: People, places, and pursuits","Reviews the book, Learning science in informal environments: People, places, and pursuits edited by Philip Bell et al. (2009). The committee and editors have conducted a comprehensive systematic review of the literature and commissioned other position papers to supplement and address voids in the extant literature. The analysis and interpretation focused on six strands: Developing interest in science, understanding science knowledge, engaging in scientific reasoning, reflecting on science, engaging in scientific practices, and identifying with the scientific enterprise. These strands were used to organize the final report into four parts: chapters 1-3 set the focus, theoretical perspectives, and assessment; chapters 4-6 provide descriptions of the venues; chapters 7-8 explore the cross-cutting and emerging themes; and chapter 9 outlines the results and recommendations. We found this book to be extremely useful in accessing and organizing the existing research results and, more importantly, identifying the existence of unaddressed issues and research voids. We will try to mention some of the many strengths of this report and will outline some of the 'it would be nice' issues for further consideration by the International Journal of Environmental and Science Education readership. First, many of the results, conclusions, and recommendations reported in this book are equally applicable to environmental, science, social studies, and mathematics education within and across formal education settings. Second, the report condemns traditional 'chalk-n-talk' instruction, rote learning, and testdriven approaches, which are supported by other NRC reports and should provide guidance for reform efforts. Third, the report acknowledges the assessment problems encountered in informal environments, which also prevail in constructivist environmental and science education programs. Fourth, the report appears to vacillate on a view of the nature of science; the choice of language did not make science fundamentally linked to people's curiosity. Fifth, unfortunately, this report does not elaborate on the concerns, barriers, and promises encountered by other minorities and the ontological and epistemological differences and similarities between traditional indigenous knowledge about nature and naturally occurring events (traditional ecological knowledge and wisdom, TEKW in Canada) and Western views of science and technology, the inquiry and design enterprises, and the knowledge systems flowing from these endeavors. Sixth, this report does not fully establish the concerns with media: journalistic versions of reports, editorials, video clips and sound bites; their commercial motives, audiences, and potential bias; and how they contribute to inaccurate views of science, certainty, time between initial findings and applications or cures (science-technology spectrum), and other features of scientific inquiry and technological design.

80,"A vision and speech enabled, customizable, virtual assistant for smart environments","Recent developments in smart assistants and smart home automation are lately attracting the interest and curiosity of consumers and researchers. Speech enabled virtual assistants (often named smart speakers) offer a wide variety of network-oriented services and, in some cases, can connect to smart. environments, thus enhancing them with new and effective user interfaces. However, such devices also reveal new needs and some weaknesses. In particular, they represent faceless and blind assistants, unable to show a face, and therefore an emotion, and unable to `see' the user. As a consequence, the interaction is impaired and, in some cases, ineffective. Moreover, most of those devices heavily rely on cloud-based services, thus transmitting potentially sensitive data to remote servers. To overcome such issues, in this paper we combine some of the most advanced techniques in computer vision, deep learning, speech generation and recognition, and artificial intelligence, into a virtual assistant. architecture for smart home automation systems. The proposed assistant is effective and resource-efficient, interactive and customizable, and the realized prototype runs on a low-cost, small sized, Raspberry PI 3 device. For testing purposes, the system was integrated with an open source home automation environment and ran for several days, while people were encouraged to interact with it, and proved to be accurate, reliable and appealing.","Iannizzotto, Giancarlo and Lo Bello, Lucia and Nucita, Andrea and Grasso, Giorgio Mario",0,,59
81,3D PRINTING IN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING EDUCATION. A BEST-PRACTICE:,"3D printing technology is an established industrial practice for rapid prototyping and manufacturing across a range of products, components and commercial sectors and at the same time possesses great potential for every-day life applications to be invented, explored and developed by the coming generations of scientists and engineers. A 3D printer installed in a school setting and complemented by well-designed educational activities can: stimulate the interest and curiosity of students; engage and motivate them into studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, that they may choose or consider as career options; give the opportunity to teachers to achieve content and concept learning in an innovative way. In this paper we present an interdisciplinary science course that was developed for high school students and was implemented in an actual science classroom. The objectives of the course were both to spark the interest and creativity of students and teach them certain curriculum units the content knowledge of which is reached or utilized in an unconventional way. Students are gradually introduced into the 3D printing technology, its application and potential and are assigned a challenging collaborative project in which they have to study, analyse, design and build, using the 3D printer of their school, an operational model of a renown ancient artefact, the so-called Antikythera Mechanism. The mechanism is a 2100 year-old computer and is internationally known as an artefact of unprecedented human ingenuity and scientific, historic and symbolic value. The course involves the teaching of STEM curriculum domains of physics, astronomy, mathematics/geometry, informatics and technology related content and also non-STEM subjects like history and Greek language, both ancient and modern. We give an overview of the course, discuss its various phases and highlight its outcomes.","Mavromanolakis, Georgios",0,,60
83,Guest editorial essay: Natural historians,"Natural histories, like that of the Roman encyclopaedist Pliny, themselves have a long history and they are records of human curiosity. They provide catalogues of phenomena, classified according to some scheme, and they reflect the world view of their compilers. This certainly applies to Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, who is best known for his Histoire Naturelle, the first volume of which was published in 1749. The remaining 35 volumes appeared over the next 29 years. It was translated into English several times over the following decades. In 1743 Buffon published two articles concerned with vision-one on accidental colours and the other on strabismus. Buffon's allegiance to empiricism did result in an interest in the development of vision. Despite the fact that Buffon and Linnaeus were antagonists, they ushered in the era of systematic observation and classification. The senses provided the basis for such classifications, and the senses in their turn were subjected to similar rigorous analysis.

84,Defensive Process and Defensive Organization: Their Place in Psychoanalytic Technique,"This reprinted article originally appeared in (International Journal of Psycho-Analysis, 1954, 35, 194-198). (An abstract of this original article appeared in record 1955-02527-001.) During analysis, from beginning to end, both the analyst and the analysand are confronted with the latter's defensive organization. Perhaps the increased interest in the defensive processes of the ego may be attributed to this very fact. Hoffer remarks that all this concern is to be expected, for as long as psychoanalysis continues to deal with the phenomena of resistance and transference, curiosity about the ego's mechanisms of defense will be in the forefront. Freud's description of defenses as (1) patterned, (2) directed toward the interior, and (3) aimed at the prevention of mental pain still seems to be a most useful one. Hoffer suggests that the defensive processes and mechanisms be conceived of as being part of and operating within a defensive organization which is, in turn, a part of, though not identical with, the total ego organization. He warns against the ready tendency to regard all defenses as pathogenic, pointing out that some of the mechanisms (called successful defenses) are also ""indispensable"" to the patient's mental health. Anna Freud's schematic presentation of the contribution of certain defenses to personality organization is an excellent illustration of this well-taken thesis. Concluding with a discussion of technique, Dr. Hoffer finds that indiscriminate interpretation of the defensive aspects of personality may stimulate new, but not necessarily more expeditious, defenses, or cause the patient to adjust to the analytic situation and the technique of the individual analyst. He feels that the best technical management involves acquainting the patient with those mechanisms which he employed in his conflicted childhood and with their associated anxieties. Defenses are not in themselves pathological formations and should be handled as necessary and constructive concomitants of analytic reconstruction.

The promise of this modern technology is dependent on our understanding of cellular complexity to allow us to engineer cells with novel function. In this regard, the fields of computer science and synthetic biology are critical for accelerating both our understanding of biological systems, and our ability to quantitatively engineer cells. Thus, advances in biology and biotechnology are arising at the intersection of computer science and synthetic biology approaches. This review seeks to introduce the field of synthetic biology to the computer science community, and to ignite a curiosity and interest in fostering a unique synergy for possible collaborations between synthetic biologists and computer scientists.","Deans, Tara L",0,10.1145/2667229,63

Research investigating these two aspects of attentional guidance has focused almost exclusively on factors common across individuals. The present study took a different tack, and examined the role played by individual differences in personality. Our findings reveal that trait curiosity is a robust and reliable predictor of an individual's eye movement behavior in scene-viewing. These findings demonstrate that who a person is relates to how they move their eyes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Feger's Drug Use Survey and Imaginal Process Inventory, against 2 discrete criteria-ever used vs never used drugs. Ss were 330 undergraduates, 185 of whom had never used drugs and 145 who reported the use of drugs 1 or more times. Significant differences were found between the 2 groups on all 14 variables. Drug users revealed a greater frequency of daydreaming, frightened reactions to daydreams, visual imagery and thinking about the past in daydreams, curiosity in impersonal-mechanical events, and a greater interest in talking about fantasies. Nondrug users showed fewer of these tendencies, but reported more hostile daydreams and more daydreams dealing with interpersonal events. An analysis of hits and misses obtained by the discriminant equations indicated that 129 (70%) of the nondrug users were correctly predicted as to group membership.

Gifted students are generally individuals that talk with uncertainty because they are always looking for solutions and discoveries for their varied researches in their area of interest. These students need educational practices that develop creativity and enable to incite their complex thinking. These practices require measures that instigate their curiosity and promote activities that represent challenges during classes. Creativity is essential for their education because the development of creativity in teaching can generate possibilities of well-being for it arouses curiosity, excitement and desire to learn from each individual. It is important that teachers are prepared to attend these children and encourage gifted students to have a creative and autonomous spirit and exercise a critical and reflective thinking about the process of teaching and learning.","Piske, Fernanda Hellen Ribeiro and Stoltz, Tania and Gu<c3><a9>rios, Etti<c3><a8>ne and de Freitas, Samarah Perszel",0,,68

Although curiosity is an important factor for learning, textbooks have been static and constant among various learners. The motivation of our work is to develop a digital textbook which displays contents dynamically based on students' interests. As interest is a positive predictor of learning, we hypothesize that students' learning and understanding will improve when they are presented information which is in line with their current cognitive state. As the first step, we investigate students' reading behaviors with an eye tracker, and propose attention and comprehension prediction approaches. These methods were evaluated on a dataset including eight participants' readings on a learning material in Physics. We classified participants' comprehension levels into three classes, novice, intermediate, and expert, indicating significant differences in reading behavior and solving tasks. <c2><a9> Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH 2018.

95,Thoughts on Improving the Teaching Efficiency of Track and Field,"Track and field lesson is an important course to cultivate students' moral will and improve physical and mental quality. But for a long time, this course has not received due attention. Even some parents and students think that this course does not include in the examination, so there is no use learning this lesson. The main reason is that the teaching methods in track and field are too single for a long time, which reflects that teaching in class is indoctrinated, thus students lack of interest in learning, and gradually they are tired of track and field lessons. To this end, changing teaching methods, paying attention to individual differences in students, respecting for the dominant position of students when they learn, stimulating their curiosity and their thirst for knowledge, and cultivating students' interest in learning to make students really learn something are keys to improve the teaching efficiency of track and field lessons.","Bo, Long and Ling, Qiu",0,,71

But is it really more surprising that we should have to learn how to observe consciousness than that we should similarly have to learn to see things in the world about us? During infancy we are first conscious and then we become self-conscious. This process of becoming conscious of the self continues for years. In some of us it finally culminates in the ability to introspect or to observe consciousness with pleasure and profit. In others it leads only to a morbid self-interest or curiosity. Those persons who never discover themselves psychologically are to those who know themselves as thinking arid feeling beings as the blind man is to the normally equipped and trained observer of nature. Clearly the first step toward an appreciation of psychology or toward making a psychologist of one's self is the discovery of consciousness.

Fluid intelligence, openness to experience, and interest","The experience of interest is central to intrinsic motivation for learning, so it is important to understand the nature of interest and its sources. Individual differences in fluid intelligence (Gf) predict finding things more interesting, but it is possible that this effect is merely due to the overlap of Gf with openness to experience, a strong predictor of interest across many domains. The present research measured Gf the Big Five traits, and the interestingness of contemporary poems and visual art. Latent variable models found that Gf predicted interest in both poems and pictures, even when openness and gender were included as predictors. Moreover, Gf and openness did not interact, indicating main effects rather than joint effects. The relationship between Gf and interest thus appears robust. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

101,Building Mashups for the Enterprise with SABRE,"The explosive popularity of mashups has given rise to a plethora of web-based tools for rapidly building mashups with minimal programming effort. In turn, this has spurred interest in using these tools to empower end-users to build situational applications for business. Situational applications based oil Reo (SABRE) is a service composition platform that addresses service heterogeneity as a first-class concern by adopting a mashup's data-centric approach. Built atop the Reo coordination language, SABRE provides tools to combine, filter and transform web services and data, sources like RSS and ATOM feeds. Whereas other mashup platforms intermingle data transformation logic and I/O concerns, we aim to clearly separate them by formalising coordination logic within a mashup. Reo's well-defined compositional semantics opens tip the possibility of constructing a mashup's core logic from a library of prebuilt connectors. Input/output in SABRE is handled by service stubs generated by combining a syntactic service specification such as WSDL with a constraint automaton specifying service behaviour. These stubs insulate services from misbehaving clients while protecting clients against services that do riot conform to their contracts.

102,Teaching Presence and Intellectual Climate in a Structured Online Learning Environment,"Teaching presence and its implications for the intellectual climate of an online classroom cannot be fully understood unless explored from the perspective of the instructors who experience it. Framed in the theoretical perspective of the Community of Inquiry (CoI) model, this collective case study investigated the actions, intentions and perceptions of instructors with the intent of developing an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon of teaching presence as it was established in a structured online learning environment. The experiences of selected successful instructors in this specific online context were explored to gain insight on how pedagogical choices influenced the establishment of an intellectual climate appropriate to the courses taught. Using semi-structured interviews as the main source of data, the study utilized the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) method as an analytical tool to address concerns of rigor in the qualitative interpretation of experiential data. It was the goal of this study to gain an understanding of how teaching presence is established and the decision processes employed in doing so in order to make a contribution to the body of knowledge from a practical pedagogical perspective. Findings of the study provided insight into the following: <e2><80><a2> Practices in Establishing Teaching Presence. <e2><80><a2> Intentions of Instructors. <e2><80><a2> Influence on Intellectual Climate. <e2><80><a2> Nature of Teaching Presence. Overall, the collective case revealed that an active interest and passion for teaching and an understanding of relevance to the student encouraged student engagement, and inspired intellectual curiosity and a shared responsibility for the learning process. The findings show that the common goal of learning shared by instructor and student had its foundations in the creation of authentic relationships between instructor and students that extend beyond stated learning objectives and expected outcomes. The results of this study contribute to knowledge related to the nature of teaching presence and its role in setting an academic climate, addressing the overarching question of the study about how instructors establish teaching presence and inspire intellectual curiosity within the courses they teach. In addition, the experiences of the selected instructors helped provide a vocabulary with which to describe the shared pedagogies of instructors and served to catalog commonalities in actions and intent associated with setting an intellectual climate that met the requirements of academic rigor appropriate to the courses they taught.","Orcutt, Janice M",0,,76
104,Effective teaching of geo-engineering subjects via project-based approach,"The delivery of geo-engineering subjects, as with most other engineering subjects, are often considered as dry and rigid, and worse still, intimidating, by the students. The traditional teaching method of one-way lecture does not particularly stimulate students to think and analyze the subjects in a creative manner, but usually results in students learning the facts and equations by heart for examinations. This could lead to students who fail to relate theories and principles to actual, real-life situations, who eventually find themselves inadequate to face the challenges of a geotechnical engineer upon graduation. In order to cultivate genuine interest and curiosity about the subjects, relevant projects were assigned to groups of students taking the subjects of Geotechnics and Advanced Geotechnics at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia. The projects involved developing sustainable `green' construction materials from soils, formulating suitable mix designs for earth bricks, as well as experimenting with various compacted soil mixtures for the optimum mixes. These projects did not only encourage students to relate lectures with laboratory work and practical problems, but also instilled team-working spirit in them. In addition, the projects promoted a sense of responsibility and accountability towards the environments as modern engineers, who do not just construct and develop, but protect the environment for the future generation too. In a nutshell, end-of-project surveys conducted among the students revealed that the incorporation of project-based learning in geo-engineering subjects can effectively deliver the knowledge and technology, while at the same time help mould the students to become responsible engineers when they leave the university.","Chan, C -M. and Suratkon, A",0,,77

The author has told us only enough to satisfy reasonable curiosity, wisely allowing the interest to center in his account of the public movements in which he took a more or less active share, of his impressions of the notable personalities with whom he came into contact, and of the development of his creed and policy. The author makes it abundantly clear that without the assumption of the reign of law in the evolution of human societies, and without the inspiration and doctrine of the founder of sociological science his life would have lacked its guiding principle. The book reflects the impression that the author's activity has made in the sphere of social conditions. The reader of the book however, fail to note with deep interest the process of the writer's emancipation from conventional orthodoxy, and of his deliberate and confident acceptance of the system of thought and conduct which he has done so much to impose upon current theories of life.

111,"Will our futures look different, now?","Having reached this outlook at the Year 2000, will an interest in the future wane? Will our futures look different? The confluence of two constructs-century and millennium-is happening amidst new curiosity and imaginings about human thinking. The certainties used to make sense of our world are cracking, just as Western geopolitical and economic power arrogantly strives for global monopoly. This new globalism is legitimised by a mindset that prizes hierarchy, market-place competition, conquest and one-way assimilation. Alternative mindsets, valuing collaboration for example, allow a critique and redefinition of persistent problems of power, as well as the invention of cultures of the future. Can explorations from alternative mindsets-feminist, indigenous, ecological, civilisational and others-help reshape the social order? Should we learn to think across multiple mindsets that are more than variations on the dominant worldview? The new-century agenda for futures studies is to experiment with bypassing the 'groupthink' that now sets in when envisioning new futures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

112,Two Oldies but Goodies in Life Span Development,"Review of Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach (6th ed.) by Barbara M. Newman and Philip R. Newman (see record 1995-97107-000) and Lifespan Development (5th ed.) by Jeffrey S. Turner and Donald B. Helms (see record 1995-97105-000). Both titles are old, but their updated editions are still widely used as life span development textbooks. Psychosocial theory serves as the conceptual framework of Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach. Psychosocial theory is based on Erik Erikson's (1950) eight stages of man in which development consists of the successful resolution of eight psychosocial tasks. Newman and Newman deviate from Erikson by developing two additional tasks: group identity versus alienation (12 to 18 years) and immortality versus extinction (75 years to death). Psychosocial theory is the guiding force behind Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach. This is an interesting approach; however, it can result in a one-sided or unconventional view of human development. Despite the interplay between genetic, maturational, societal, and self-directed factors in psychosocial theory, the sixth edition still does not mention the work of Chomsky (1959, 1982) or the maturational theory of language development. Turner and Helms's Lifespan Development is designed to uncover the sequences and patterns of growth that influence the course of human development. Lifespan Development identifies seven themes important to human development, and they reappear throughout all stages of the life cycle. Turner and Helms present current and timely aspects of development across the life span. The most neglected chapter in their book is ""Late Adulthood"" where many important issues such as sexuality, friends, religion, leisure, caregiving, and the distinction between normal and pathological aging are simply left out. Both books are arranged chronologically. However, Turner and Helms provide a flexible table of contents that can be used either topically or chronologically. The Newman and Newman text and the Turner and Helms text differ with respect to the incorporation of pedagogical features to facilitate the student's learning process. Both textbooks include chapter summaries in each chapter and a glossary of key terms, but that is the extent of the pedagogical features for Newman and Newman. Turner and Helms begin each chapter with a series of questions designed to pique curiosity and, to stimulate students' interest, critical thought questions are included in the chapter margins and coded as one of the seven recurring themes.

114,At the forest's edge: A place-based approach to teaching ecosystem services,"When human societies adopt an extractive relationship with nature, the native vegetation and natural contours of the land give way to satisfy the short-term needs of a developing society. As important as economic developments are in meeting the needs of a community, some of their costs are shifted elsewhere, either in space or in time. For a devegeted landscape, these costs may include eroded hillsides where the native forest once held soil in place. Or, these costs may increase stream flow variability in a forest that once regulated the flow of water over and through a landscape. The retention of soil and regulation of water flow are two examples of ecosystem services, defined here as the benefits that humans obtain from ecosystems. Ecosystem services include the provision of raw material (e.g., fish or timber), the regulation of natural processes (e.g., flooding or climate), essential supporting services (e.g., oxygen in the atmosphere due to photosynthesis and the formation of soil), and cultural services (e.g., recreational opportunities or aesthetic gratification) (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2003). Human societies have always altered ecosystems: too often, those changes have been made without an understanding of the consequences. In the past century, ecologists have traced the myriad connections between different ecosystems and the processes essential to human life. As the ability of human societies to alter the earth intensifies, it is increasingly important to understand the services that ecosystems provide as a way to offset or prevent losses that threaten our long-term social and economic prospects. In this chapter, we discuss a placebased approach to introducing students to ecosystem services. Many environmentalists are uneasy about a focus on ecosystem services and attempts to place a value upon them. Placing a more sophisticated price tag on nature suggests a continuing willingness to buy and sell, and a failure to see value in non-economic terms. Despite these concerns, we view the lens of ecosystem services as one useful perspective, a productive addition to historical valuations of ecosystems based on what could be extracted from them. Many Americans may question whether preserving wetlands for their rich biological complexity is worth the cost-but these same individuals will likely agree to wetland preservation if doing so offsets property damage from flooding or fees for building a higher levee. Our focus on the forests of southern Indiana emerges from several concerns. First, ecosystem services in the abstract can become an unappealing litany of complex processes. When teaching environmental literacy, we strive to engage our students with the local landscape, teaching ecological concepts along with (we hope) a love of place. We thus offer our home landscape-Indiana's forests- as a model for how to embody the abstractions of ecosystem services in the history of the natural communities of a particular area. In other places, the native landscapes might be dominated by sagebrush, ponderosa pines, arboreal cacti, or perennial bunchgrasses, and thus our attention would turn to the particulars of these ecosystems. When choosing our focus, we first look for changes that are dramatic, and so readily apparent to students regardless of their formal background in ecology or natural history. Deforestation fits these cause and effect requirements: ancient Greek and Roman writers noted the prompt effects of deforestation with the erosion of soil and the drying of springs. If we were examining the loss of prairies, we would start with the erosion that accompanied the conversion of perennial grasses to annual crops. After capturing student interest, we could then move on to other important consequences of prairie conversion, such as the loss of carbon storage in the soil and its connections to global climate change issues. Finally, our choice of forests reflects a deliberate effort to provide a message of hope. Environmental educators must necessarily increase student consciousness to the grave challenges facing humanity without being seen as the voices of fear and despair. The regeneration of forests in Indiana and elsewhere testifies to the resilience of the natural world, and to the impor tance of understanding the conditions under which ecosystem services can be restored. Elsewhere, we might turn to the rebirth of rivers following the Clean Water Act of 1972, the rapid recovery of riparian areas following fencing from livestock, or the success of prairie restorations. We believe that teaching students to see the changes in their landscape, wherever that might be, is the best place to begin. Curiosity about the ecological consequences of those changes would then be more likely to inform a student's consciousness. <c2><a9> 2010 by Indiana University Press.

115,MODERN TEACHING STRATEGIES USED IN MODERN TEACHING OF THE SUBJECTS OF,"The reforms in education are determinated by the requirements of the socio-economical development adapted to the labour market, the existing possibilities, the economical conditions, the development of education sciences and educational policy and to the managerial skills in the field of education. Teachers need to be appropiate and adapted to the needs of society and to the learners, and to have basic behaviors specific to the learning-educational activity. The course and laboratory activities must have the role of presenting the ways of inciting of interest and curiosity for the studied disciplines and of opening new communication channels. The new didactics of cognitivist type, the didactics of learning specific intellect capabilities or that based on the multiple intelligence theory represent large leaps in the field of teaching. The new content of the learning can no longer be developed within the limits of the traditional learning practice, producing the transformation of the teachers in the designing curriculum specialists. The work presents aspects regarding the active and interactive learning, the interactive teaching-learning methods and their importance in the study of environmental protection disciplines. The modern didactics places the student at the center of the learning process, participating to the own training, and the teacher has the role of design, organize, lead and correct the work itself, in order to develop the intelligence and the learning of the appropiate conduct. The modern methods: the lecture, the teaching demonstration, the problem-solving, the experiment, the brainstorming, the double entry journal, the SINELG, the gallery tour, the cube, the snowball, the mosaic, are considered relevant in making the education reform, to place the student at the center of the learning process. For each method are presented examples in the study of the environmental disciplines.","Popa, Roxana-Gabriela",0,,88

118,A general theory of emotions and social life,"This unique volume presents a general theory linking emotions and rational thought to social relationships. In his innovative new book TenHouten presents an encyclopedic classification of the emotions (describing 54 in total) and offers one of the most original and multi-leveled accounts of the emotions and social life ever developed. This neurocognitive sociology of the emotions shows primary emotions to be adaptive reactions to fundamental problems of life which have evolved into elementary social relationships and which can predict occurrences of the entire spectrum of primary, complex secondary, and tertiary emotions. The scope of this work is comprehensive and includes the development of emotions in childhood, symbolic elaboration of complex emotions, emotions management, violence, and cultural and gender differences. This volume is essential reading for all those with an interest in the emotions across the social and behavioral sciences.

121,Distracting users as per their knowledge: Combining linked open data and word embeddings to enhance history learning,"Organizations that preserve and promote heritage must meet the expectatives of sophisticated visitors who, far from wanting simply to be informed, desire to explore engaging and innovative technology-driven experiences which consider their particular interests and encourage them to discover more. We describe an approach based on quiz games that can be exploited in the deployment of such challenging experiences. The game consists of raising multiple-choice questions about a particular theme which is introduced by a Humanities expert through a brief narrative. Given the input text, a question and its right answer, our strategy provides the expert with a set of wrong alternatives (called distractors). These options are chosen from a (semi)automatically-built tailor-made corpus of documents by considering each player's level of knowledge on the game theme and exploiting Linked Open Data initiatives and natural language processing. On the one hand, automatic selection of distractors assists the Humanities expert to create games about very diverse topics without needing to be a specialist in all of them. On the other one, distractors are related to the right answer of each question in an appealing and meaningful way, which contributes to arouse the visitors' curiosity and their possible interest in exploring similar experiences in future visits. The work has been experimentally validated, achieving better results than a previous distractor identification strategy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

123,Curiosity,"Wanting to know something for its own sake, wanting to do something simply because it is interesting-this is part of human nature. In this chapter, we explored a functional analysis of curiosity. Modem models of motivation and emotion have much to say about the role of interest in learning, adaptation, and development. Fundamentally, curiosity motivates the enormous amount of learning that people need to do. Over time, people develop the skills and knowledge needed to flourish because they enjoy learning and are easily bored. Although some people are more curious than others, and people's quirky interests will vary, all people are essentially curious creatures.

124,In Defense of Today's Struggling Reader: What Policymakers Can Learn from Beth,"Beth attends a New York City K-8, dual-language (Spanish/English) public school where 96% of the students qualify as low-income, based on participation in the federally funded lunch program. Early in Beth's 1st-grade year, she was classified as a struggling reader, based on district-wide assessments that identified academic deficits in such skill areas as phonemic awareness, letter/sound identification, and writing development. In Beth's school, teachers and administrators regularly met to discuss how to help young struggling readers--devising intervention plans, curricular modifications, and test preparation courses. Although the high-stakes assessments labeled Beth as needing help with print-related skills, they did not evaluate her desire to read and write, her curiosity and interest in printed text, and her commitment to becoming a successful student. Despite these positive learning traits, Beth's performance on district assessments told another, less encouraging story. In this article, the author questions the way that teachers and administrators intervene with struggling readers in today's early childhood classrooms and suggests that the current, prescriptive approach blinds them from seeing the ""whole child""--that is, taking into account capabilities that children such as Beth exhibit in learning environments. While many teachers and administrators might react swiftly to a struggling reader with targeted instructional intervention, the author proposes a different approach. She describes Beth's experience as a struggling reader, sharing the story of a young child who viewed herself to be both a capable reader and writer and a contributing member of her classroom community. In fact, Beth demonstrated resilience and potential while learning to read and write within a linguistically rich and complex social world, despite her status as a struggling reader. When a struggling reader's performance in high-stakes assessments is viewed within a social milieu, a different narrative unfolds.","Spencer, Tamara",0,,94
128,Themes and developments of psychoanalytic thought in Italy,"The development of psychoanalysis in Italy has long remained little known to the international scientific community, as Italian is a language spoken in one country only, and until recent years the knowledge of foreign languages has not been a specific competence among Italian psychoanalysts. Indeed, until recently, the humanistic classical culture of Greek and Latin was given first priority at Italian schools. This characteristic has resulted in various phenomena. A number of Italian psychoanalysts have taken an interest in the main currents of international psychoanalytical thought and edited the Italian translations of many foreign texts. They have also traveled to Paris and London for supervisions and seminars stimulated by a passion and curiosity for the new developments in psychoanalysis in which they have found themselves hindered by the language barrier. Psychoanalysis in Italy has not, therefore, taken on prevalent common characteristics, but has developed varying orientations, depending on the personal contacts established and has become a multicultural and multilingual context.

129,Educational research-history of education a curious case?,"The article begins with an exploration of the current state of history of education by drawing on published reviews of history of education, thematic analysis of journal content, and mapping of postgraduate study. It then highlights `moments of insecurity'. These are characterised by a particular discourse that frames the future of the discipline in particular ways to suggest that history of education is dependent on concerted strategic decisions in response to `moments of challenge' resulting from institutional change, and particularly in response to the disappearance of history of education from teacher education. Rather than seeing `moments of insecurity' as stages of disintegration for disciplines the article argues that they can constitute `moments of opportunity' when disciplines reach out to spaces shared with other disciplines to develop interdisciplinary ways of working. The article then discusses `moments of curiosity' that enrich the methodological and substantive development of the history of education. In history of education, `moments of curiosity' have occurred on the basis of intellectual exchange in a dialogic associational way within networks rather than being a direct outcome of strategic responses to `moments of insecurity'. They are resulting in organic growth that is developing the landscape of history of education in several ways. The article ends by pointing to the importance of an historical dimension for bringing contextual understanding to enrich contemporary research and by stressing the need within the discipline for researchers (individually or collectively) to develop an eye for `intelligence' and strategic vision to link their interests with current challenges in order to highlight lacunae in current practice in and for education.","Goodman, Joyce and Grosvenor, Ian",0,10.1080/03054980903216325,96

However, a person's interest in an item is not determined by his/her preference alone. Psychological research has shown that curiosity is a critical motivation relating to a person's interests and driving explorative behaviours. Motivated as above, we aim to model user curiosity in social recommendation context. In this work, we model uncertainty driven curiosity, wherein uncertainty is a well acknowledged factor that stimulates human curiosity. We model user uncertainty based on two well-known theories of uncertainty, i.e., Shannon entropy and Damster-Shafter theory. Then, we rank items by consolidating both user preference and user uncertainty using weighted Borda count. The proposed model is evaluated with two large-scale real world datasets, Douban and Flixster. The experimental results highlight that uncertainty driven curiosity has a positive impact on personalized ranking, by remarkably improving recommendation precision and diversity.","Wu, Qiong and Liu, Siyuan and Miao, Chunyan",0,10.1145/3106426.3106475,100
135,Prescription opioid misuse: Characteristics of earliest and most recent memory of hydromorphone use,"Objectives: Prescription opioid use is highly prevalent and a major physician concern. However, little is known about how individuals initiate into use of these medications or how they use them later in life. Hydromorphone is a medication of particular interest given its subjective similarities to heroin and tendency to be misused by illicit opioid users. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of initial, and more recent, hydromorphone use occasions as remembered by a population of individuals in treatment for their opioid use. Methods: Seventy-eight clients enrolled in low-threshold methadone maintenance treatment were interviewed regarding their earliest and most recent uses of hydromorphone. Results: Hydromorphone was first used after trying many different substances (eg, tobacco, alcohol, hallucinogens, powder cocaine). Two-thirds of the sample reported initially using hydromorphone without a prescription. Participants who initially used hydromorphone without a prescription reported using for different reasons (ie, to get high, curiosity vs manage pain), via different routes of administration (ie, injection vs orally), and were more likely to co-use other substances, than those whose earliest hydromorphone use was prescribed. However, these 2 subgroups did not differ greatly during their most recent use occasion (ie, the majority reported using to avoid withdrawal, via injection; almost 50% reported co-use with other substances). Conclusions: There was considerable variability in characteristics of hydromorphone use initiation among individuals enrolled in low-threshold methadone maintenance treatment. However, later use of hydromorphone was remarkably consistent across individuals and shares many characteristics previously documented for heroin use. Additional investigations into hydromorphone are warranted, particularly given previous findings regarding the prevalence of nonmedical use of this drug and its similarities to heroin.

136,UTILIZATION OF A ROBOT AS AN EDUCATION MATERIAL FOR A PUBLIC JUNIOR HIGH,"The movement of science, technology, engineering, mathematics integrated education (STEM) is being promoted in many countries. Similarly in Japan, in order to promote the originality, intellectual curiosity, research interest in science, technology, mathematics of students, and to foster the next generation of leaders in science and technology, many programs such as SSH(Super Science High Schools), SPP(Science Partnership Project), and so on have been performed. However, over the years, it has been a problem in Japan that students do not actually feel the significance and usefulness of studying science. It's said that substantiality of empirical learning is important in order to let a student recognize the significance of studying science. In order to improve a student's individual skill and volition, teachers have to understand the personality of each student further, and find the time for students to face the teachers while cooperating with an organization outside of the school. However, the school hours for experimental trainings in science and technology will not be increased when it was reviewed from its circumstances of the past courses of study. Furthermore, it is difficult to conduct time-consuming experiments and training in a public junior high school due to extra costs, extra works required more than a regular lesson and teaching. Even though, most teachers have high volition and consciousness about the education in the school. Therefore, effective educational materials are required in science and technology. Junior high school students are fascinated with new technology. A robot is considered to be a motivation to increase a student's interest in science or technology. The aim of this study is to validate the effectiveness and problems of the utilization of a robot as an education material for usual classes in a public junior high school. A collaboration science and technology class was performed in third grade of Kazokita Junior High School in Saitama, Japan, using small mobile robots as teaching materials. The number of students was 39. Ten teaching assistants volunteered. The class lesson was carried out for two hours continuously with a break of 10 minutes in between. A small mobile robot was assembled using electric parts on a bead board as an educational material in the class. The application program used to mobilize the mobile robot was S4A(Scratch for Arduino) and modified specifically for the class. The contents taught are related to the science and technology text book chapter ``Information and communications technology in our life'' and ``Let's know a role and the function of the program''. The questionnaire surveys of the science class showed that students recognized that they made a robot by themselves and most students enjoyed the class and want to do again. As a result, the utilization of the small mobile robot as an educational material with the cooperation between a junior high school and a university was very effective not only in order to achieve the purpose of a science lesson, but also in order to evoke the interest of engineering and science.","Ishihara, Atsushi and Zhang, TianWen and Shen, Brian Teoh Kai and Muraishi, Wataru and Nakahara, Masaya and Ohashi, Atsushi and Kobayashi, Akiyo",0,,102
137,"Cross-sectional associations between psychological traits, and HPV vaccine uptake and intentions in young adults from the United States","Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection worldwide and can lead to the development of genital warts, and cancers throughout the body. Despite the availability of HPV vaccines for over a decade, uptake in the United States among adolescents and young adults remains well below national targets. While most efforts to improve HPV vaccine uptake have rightly focused on adolescents, there is still a tremendous opportunity to improve vaccination among young adults who have not been vaccinated against HPV. To that end, we report an exploratory examination of associations between HPV vaccination status and intentions with psychological traits that may impact HPV vaccine uptake with a national, demographically diverse sample of young adults (N = 1358) who completed an online survey. These psychological traits conceptually mapped onto motivations to: 1) understand health-related information, 2) deliberate, 3) manage uncertainty, and 4) manage threats. We found notable gender differences for the association of these motivations and vaccination status. For women, higher interest in and ability to understand healthrelated information seemed to distinguish those who reported receiving the HPV vaccine from those who did not. For men, less need to deliberate and greater needs to manage threat and uncertainty seemed to be the distinguishing motives for those who reported receiving the HPV vaccine compared to those who did not. Results for vaccination intentions were less consistent, but there was some evidence to indicate that, regardless of gender, greater health-related information interest and understanding and need to manage uncertainty and threats were associated with increased intention to receive the HPV vaccine, while greater need to deliberate was associated with decreased vaccination intentions. These results suggest that there are psychological differences that are associated with HPV vaccination decisions and that these motivations should be considered in efforts to improve HPV vaccine uptake.

140,Jews and Judaism in Goethe's esthetical and reactionary world: A typological study,"In the period spanning the late 19th and the early 20th centuries a huge number of articles and books on ""Goethe and Judaism"" were published in Germany. Their authors were Jews and Germans, their tenor accordingly apologetic or anti (philo)-Semitic. Astonishingly the evidence indicates that the German and Jewish interest in Goethe's views on Jewish traditions and way of life was out of all proportion to what Goethe's interest in Judaism had been in real life. In his numerous works we find only a few remarks on Jewish traditions, literature or personalities. His autobiographical Dichtung und Wahrheit contains a section devoted to the memoirs of a young man walking around the Frankfurter Ghetto. His curiosity, his interest as a poet in Judaism is confined to stereotypical, hackneyed phenomena, most of them taken from (Christian) anti-Jewish polemical literature and loci communi. Also Goethe's often stressed admiration for the ""Old Testament"" cannot obscure the fact that he considered Judaism an early form of Christianity, both of them to be abolished in his own pantheistic form of religion. Goethe's political attitude to Jews and their striving for equal civil rights was a negative one; in his Weimar he was indeed more than conservative, even reactionary. Already by the 1840s a violent controversy about Goethe's supposed attitudes to Judaism was raging, in part because some Jews supported a Jewish opponent of Goethe's, the Frankfurter Ludwig B<c3><b6>rne. By the end of the 19th century the atmosphere in Jewish circles had changed. Ludwig Geiger, son of the well-known Reform rabbi Abraham Geiger, began a close analysis of German ""canonical"" literature (Goethe, Schiller, von Humboldt etc.), searching for German attitudes to ""Judaism."" His openly declared aim was to place Judaism at the core of German life, to have Judaism considered an essential part of German culture. Alas, in vain. By the 1930s the violent struggle to identify the ""true"" German culture was turning into an even more catastrophic confrontation. Anti-Semitic pamphlets (mis)used Goethe to attack Jewish authors who fell back on Goethe's words in defending their own participation in German cultural life. In the Jewish view Goethe was not an anti-Semite. The debate of course ceased with the destruction of German Jewry. In the years following the Shoah very few articles have been devoted to the topic; even in Goethe jubilee years the theme has been virtually passed over in silence. A recent conference on Goethe and Judaism held in Frankfurt invited only German literature specialists, no historians, no Jewish Studies scholars. The question is whether it is, perhaps, too embarrassing to present Goethe in his historical context, beyond the poetic halo of mere aesthetics. Goethe is, even today, a symbol of the German-Jewish relationship, typos of the problem of cultural identity.","Veltri, G",0,10.2143/REJ.162.1.251,105
142,Fostering assessment of student mobility in secondary schools: indicators of intercultural competence,"The present study explores the internationalisation of secondary schools. It focuses on the assessment of the intercultural competence (IC) of returnees who participated in an annual study-abroad programme offered by the Italian educational association Intercultura (a non-profit organisation). The precise aim of this research is to find possible assessment indicators of IC, specific to the context of student mobility in secondary schools. To reach this goal, a qualitative methodology was adopted; 21 semi-structured interviews were conducted with the returnees, their parents, friends, teachers and Intercultura volunteers. The findings suggest that the elements to be considered in assessing the IC of returnees should include, among others, curiosity towards people perceived as having different cultural backgrounds, interest in global issues, self-awareness, new understanding of home context, knowledge of host context, ability to make critical comparisons, adaptability and ethnorelative view. <c2><a9> 2018, <c2><a9> 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Baiutti, M",0,10.1080/14675986.2018.1495318,106

It was at the suggestion of her husband, Bob Rorke, whom she married in 1960, that she pursued a career in neuropathology, as that would combine her longtime interest in mind/ brain and diseases of children. Upon completion of the Fellowship in 1962, she was invited to join the Philadelphia General Hospital (PGH) staff as chief of pediatric pathology and assistant to Dr. Riggs. Her nurturing family, teachers, and friends encouraged her to follow wherever the curiosity led her.

147,"A ""Toolbox Approach"" for Developing Thoughtfully Structured, Creative Art Experiences","Art and creativity are closely linked in the minds of most people. When asked to explain why art should be part of the school curriculum, respondents commonly answer that art provides an opportunity for students to be creative and express themselves. As professionals who have worked with art education for years, the authors suggest a different perspective. In this article they draw on research that shows how difficult it is to teach students to be creative, and how lessons, including art lessons, need to be thoughtfully structured in order to foster creativity. To help teachers facilitate students' creative development, the authors offer a ""toolbox approach"" to teaching creativity. This approach encourages teachers to mine existing research as well as personal experiences to develop strategies that can foster creativity. A teacher's Creativity Toolbox is a set of concepts and techniques that a teacher develops over time to help students think and act creatively. In collaboration with students, teachers may also develop a class toolbox, which includes relevant concepts and techniques that are part of a classroom culture. Finally, students can develop their own toolboxes, which include interests, activities, goals, and habits of mind that spark their curiosity and help them to think creatively. In this article, the authors start by examining ways of defining creativity, as it is a concept that even people immersed in creative work find difficult to describe. They make suggestions for art teachers regarding developing their own Creativity Toolboxes. Finally, they give an example of a classroom in which a teacher puts some of these ideas into practice.

148,``If He Had 40 Cents He'd Buy Matches Instead of Lollies'': Motivational Factors in a Sample of New Zealand Adolescent Firesetters,"Motivation has been proposed as an important factor in both the causality and subsequent treatment of juveniles who deliberately light fires. Thus, a wide range of research has previously been completed, investigating such motives. This research has resulted in the creation of classifications of firesetting motives and behaviours, all of which fit upon a continuum of motivational categories-ranging from curiosity or match play, through to deliberate delinquent acts. This current study aimed to gain insight into how both firesetters and their caregivers perceived firesetting motivation. A total of 18 male youths, who had engaged in deliberate firesetting, and 13 parents were interviewed. Qualitative analysis gathered from interviews with adolescent participants reported personality and individual characteristic themes, the most frequent of these being anger, experimenting, peer pressure, and boredom. Parents on the other hand initially cited family historical factors as being a cause for their son's firesetting. This study showed the difficulties in attempting to classify firesetters. It became clear that there were often multiple motivations involved in adolescent firesetting, meanwhile a variation of motivations were reported by parents and firesetters. The differences between and ambiguities inherent in existing motivational typologies also became evident. The study produced strong evidence for the effectiveness of utilising multiple sources to gain a comprehensive understanding as to why children deliberately light fires.","Walsh, Daniel P and Lambie, Ian",0,10.1177/0306624X11422224,109
149,Teaching History of Architecture--Moving from a Knowledge Transfer to a Multi-Participative Methodology Based on IT Tools,"The changes that the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) framework obliged the School of Architecture of Malaga, University of Malaga. to make to its ""History of Architecture"" course are discussed in this paper. It was taken up as an opportunity to modify the whole course, introducing creative teaching and ""imaginative activities"" to put the students at the centre of the learning experience and giving them part control over the course. IT technologies such as Pinterest were used to create a friendly visual learning environment to offer richer learning experiences and positive effects on the students. Time dedicated to the presentation of theoretical content in the course was reduced by half and the program was redefined from the chronology of the previous program to a reading of the use of the classical orders throughout history. This change generated interest, curiosity and a greater understanding of the relationships between different styles which use the same elements. The implementation of several activities such as problem solving exercises, complementary readings and video helped to focus the course on a student-centred learning environment, was valued positively by the students.","Cimadomo, Guido",0,,110
150,Personality traits in the domestic dog (Canis familiaris),"The domestic dog (Canis familiaris) has been subjected to a huge range of selection pressures during domestication that has resulted in a considerable diversity in morphology and behaviour. This, together with the many uses the dog is put to in our society, makes the dog an interesting model for studies of animal personality. However, only a few attempts have been done to study individual differences in dogs. In this study, behavioural data from 15,329 dogs of 164 different breeds were used to investigate the existence of personality traits in dogs. The data were collected at a personality test that tested the dogs' reactions to strangers, ``fleeing'' prey-like objects, and several potential fear- and aggression-eliciting stimuli. Factor analyses revealed the existence of five narrow traits: ``Playfulness'', ``Curiosity/Fearlessness'', ``Chase-proneness'', ``Sociability'' and ``Aggressiveness''. Higher-order factor analyses showed that all factors except ``Aggressiveness'' were related to each other, creating a broad factor that influences behaviour in a range of situations. Both narrow and broad factors were found in a dataset including data from a large number of breeds, as well as within eight of Federation Cynologique Internationale's (FCI's) 10 breed groups. This indicates that the personality dimensions found in the study are general for the dog as a species. The finding of a major behavioural dimension in different groups of dog breeds, together with comparable results previously found for wolves (Canis lupus), suggests that the dimension is evolutionarily stable and has survived the varied selection pressures encountered during domestication. The broad factor is comparable to the shyness-boldness axis previously found in both humans and animals, and to human ``supertraits'' (a combination of Extraversion and Neuroticism). The results of this study can be used to describe and compare individual dogs, as well as breeds. This, in turn, can be used in applications like selection of service dogs and breeding animals, as well as predicting behaviour problems in pet dogs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

As people who are significant in organising children's environment, how teachers and parents respond to children's exploratory behaviours may promote or hinder the child's desire for further investigation. With reference to Kurt Lewin's concept of 'total situation', various hypothetical scenarios on children's exploratory behaviours in different contexts were designed to solicit teachers' and parents' interpretation of the behaviour, how they might respond in the situation and the rationale behind their response. The findings indicated that the decision of adults in allowing children to explore is influenced by a combination of child, adult and situational factors. <c2><a9> 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Chak, A",0,10.1080/03004430802181965,113
153,The Craft of Writing: A Physician-Writer's Workshop for Resident Physicians,"Introduction: How can residency programs help trainees address conflicting emotions about their professional roles and cultivate a curiosity about their patients' lives beyond their diseases? We drew on the medical humanities to address these challenges by creating an intensive writing workshop for internal medicine residents. Aim: To help participants become better physicians by reflecting on their experiences and on what gives meaning to work and life. This paper describes the workshop and how residents were affected by the focus on the craft of writing. Setting: A group of 15 residents from 3 training programs affiliated with 1 institution. Program Description: We engaged the expertise of physician-writer Abraham Verghese in planning and facilitating the 2 and one-half day workshop. Residents' submissions were discussed with a focus on the effectiveness of the writing. We also conducted a focus group with participants to evaluate the workshop. Program Evaluation: Themes in the writing included dysphoria, impotence of the physician, and the healing power of compassion. Our focus group data suggested that this workshop served as a creative outlet from the rigors of medicine, created a sense of community among participants, enhanced both self-awareness and awareness of their patients' lives, and increased intra-institutional and extra-institutional interest in writing and the residency program. Discussion: Teaching creative writing to residents in an intensive workshop may deepen interactions with peers and patients, improve writing skills, and increase interest in writing and the residency program.

155,Frustration and opportunity: Teaching child and adolescent psychiatry throughout medical education,"If you care about psychiatric education, you probably already know everything we are going to mention in this introduction. If you care about child and adolescent psychiatry, you probably already know this introduction even better. Many of the articles in this issue seem to begin with the same set of data. They make clear their case for more education in child psychiatry throughout every stage of medical teaching by noting the crises facing psychiatrically ill children and adolescents. And yet, as the articles in this issue show, these arguments have not materialized into large-scale changes across medical schools. In addition to accentuating the crises in our field, the articles in this issue also wonderfully celebrate the pleasurable challenges of providing care to psychiatrically ill children and adolescents. This issue shows us data that when we invest ourselves in these educational efforts, we can get results. We can create interest, enthusiasm, intellectual curiosity, and, it is hoped, like-minded clinicians who will choose child psychiatry as their career. Then we can start reading some new, more optimistic statistics at the beginnings of these articles. That would be a welcome change.

156,Modeling and augmenting game entertainment through challenge and curiosity,"This paper presents quantitative measurements/metrics of qualitative entertainment features within computer game environments and proposes artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for optimizing entertainment in such interactive systems. A human-verified metric of interest (i.e. player entertainment in real-time) for predator/prey games and a neuro-evolution on-line learning (i. e. during play) approach have already been reported in the literature to serve this purpose. In this paper, an alternative quantitative approach to entertainment modeling based on psychological studies in the field of computer games is introduced and a comparative study of the two approaches is presented. Feedforward neural networks (NNs) and fuzzy-NNs are used to model player satisfaction (interest) in real-time and investigate quantitatively how the qualitative factors of challenge and curiosity contribute to human entertainment. We demonstrate that appropriate non-extreme levels of challenge and curiosity generate high values of entertainment and we project the extensibility of the approach to other genres of digital entertainment (e.g. mixed-reality interactive playgrounds).","Yannakakis, Georgios N and Hallam, John",0,10.1142/S0218213007003667,117
157,Development of the self-curiosity attitude-interest scale,"Even though introspection, reflection, and mentalization are important processes in clinical practice, no self-report measure has been developed to address the psychological construct of self-curiosity. This paper addresses this disparity, and provides a new self-report measure on this topic and data on its nomological network. Curiosity about self was initially conceptualized as the desire that people have to explore and understand themselves and their psychological functioning beyond what they already know about themselves. The manuscript presents data from three independent samples used to build the Self- Curiosity Attitude-Interest (SCAI) scale. Data show that the SCAI comprises two dimensions: Attitude toward self-curiosity (cognitive propensity toward exploring one's own inner world) and interest in increasing knowledge of self (emotional/motivational pull to understand oneself better). An independent sample shows good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and evidence of construct validity of the SCAI. This paper discusses the utility of the SCAI in clinical practice and research. <c2><a9> 2015 Cises.","Aschieri, F and Durosini, I",0,10.4473/TPM22.3.2,118
158,Why Einstein Became Famous in America,"An attempt is made to explain why Einstein became a celebrity in America in 1919-21. The initial factor was the sudden great interest in the theory of relativity that developed because of the dramatic way it was announced as being confirmed, and because of the phrases that happened to be associated with it. These phrases were particularly suited to generate interest in America, which at that time was especially xenophobic, suspicious of science, fearful of domination, but also greatly concerned with advancement and self-improvement. The fame of the theory naturally led to curiosity about Einstein, the theory's creator. When Einstein came to the United States in 1921 as part of a Zionist delegation, the warm welcome American Jews gave the delegation, and Chaim Weizmann in particular, was mistakenly described by the American press as a hero's welcome for Einstein. This led to a complex series of interactions between the Yiddish and English language press that resulted in Einstein being considered a hero and a secular saint. But the xenophobia and suspicion that had played a part in the theory's fame, also contributed to Einstein's growing personal fame. <c2><a9> 1985, SAGE Publications.

Previously considered to be a rare neurological curiosity, CAA is now recognised as an important cause of spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage and cognitive impairment in the elderly, two fundamental challenges in the field of cerebrovascular disease.

162,Early child care in Britain,"This monograph on early child care in Britain is a comprehensive, honest, and self critical account of the ways in which family and nation share responsibility for the care of the infant and young child. The reader will discover a rather mixed picture of excellent programs in some aspects of child care and for some age ranges, and less exemplary services in others. He will also find a current momentum for reorganization and expansion of services. British health care, comprehensive, personalized, and almost entirely free of direct charge, is presently undergoing significant organizational change designed to integrate every aspect of health care at a local level, with multidisciplinary management teams. The Social Service is likewise being unified and strengthened locally. The British Infant Schools, in which children begin their compulsory public education from age five, have been a model for reform in preschool and primary education in many countries seeking to preserve the spontaneity, activity, and lively curiosity of young children and to individualize the pace of early learning to suit their emerging interests and capabilities. For the under fives, however, preschool places have been scarce. This situation may now be rectified by a 10 year program which would provide free nursery education for half of all 3 year olds and 90% of 4 year olds, with 15% of the places for each age group to be full time. Voluntary recreational educational activities are also of interest because they occupy a very important place alongside the public and private institutions in Great Britain. The reader will find, in addition, information about day care (child minding), parent education, research, and many other facets of early child care.","Kellmer Pringle, M and Naidoo, S",0,,123

Scholarly studies uniformly characterize McDougall's relationship with his New World colleagues as contentious: in the standard view, McDougall's theory of innate drives clashed with the Americans' experimentation into learned habits. This essay argues instead that rising American curiosity about inborn appetites-an interest rooted in earlier pragmatic philosophy and empirically investigated by interwar scientists-explains McDougall's migration to the United States and his growing success there. A review of McDougall's intellectual and professional ties, evolving outside public controversy, highlights persistent American attention to natural agency and complicates arguments voiced by contemporaries in favor of nurture. <c2><a9> 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Rose, A C",0,10.1002/jhbs.21811,124
167,Influence of teacher-directed scientific inquiry on students' primal inquiries in two science classrooms,"Scientific inquiry is widely used but pervasively misunderstood in elementary classrooms. The use of inquiry is often attached to direct instruction models of teaching, or is even passed as textbook readings or worksheets. Previous literature on scientific inquiry suggests a range or continuum beginning with teacher-directed inquiry on one extreme, which involves a question, process, and outcome that are predetermined by the teacher. On the other end of the continuum is an element of inquiry that is extremely personal and derived from innate curiosity without external constraints. This authentic inquiry is defined by the study as primal inquiry. If inquiry instruction is used in the elementary classroom, it is often manifested as teacher-directed inquiry, but previous research suggests the most interesting, motivating, and lasting content is owned by the individual and exists within the individual's own curiosity, questioning and processes. Therefore, the study examined the impact of teacher-directed inquiry in two elementary fourth grade classrooms on climate-related factors including interest, motivation, engagement, and student-generated inquiry involvement. The study took place at two elementary classrooms in Arizona. Both were observed for ten weeks during science instruction over the course of one semester. Field notes were written with regard for the inquiry process and ownership, along with climate indicators. Student journals were examined for evidence of primal inquiry, and twenty-two students were interviewed between the two classrooms for evidence of low climate-related factors and low inquiry involvement. Data from the three sources were triangulated. The results of this qualitative study include evidence for three propositions, which were derived from previous literature. Strong evidence was provided in support of all three propositions, which suggest an overall negative impact on climate-related factors of interest, motivation, and engagement for students working within a teacher-directed scientific inquiry environment. Very little existed in terms of time, materials, or opportunities for students to explore science using their own questions and processes. Furthermore, as students conformed to a teacher-directed inquiry environment, their own primal inquiries were displaced and undervalued. Ownership belonged to the teacher and precluded primal inquiries in both classrooms. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Stone, Brian Andrew",0,,125

Self-efficacy and comprehension are interrelated. If students believe they have a good chance to understand what they are reading, they are likely to be more motivated to engage in reading and to persevere. Vacca discusses the importance of prereading strategies to create a sense of purpose and thus increase students' motivation--strategies that involve arousing curiosity, evoking predictions and creating anticipation, generating problems to be solved, and eliciting student-generated questions. He gives examples of innovative ways that teachers have primed students' personal interest and feeling of purpose before they plunge into assigned readings.","Vacca, Richard T",0,,127

175,Clarifying the dispositional basis of social anxiety: A hierarchical perspective,"There has been substantial interest in the personality correlates of social anxiety, both at the higher order and lower order trait levels. We review this literature, focusing particularly on evidence for associations with neuroticism/negative emotionality (N/NE) and its facets; extraversion/positive emotionality (E/PE) and its facets; and several other specific traits (self-critical perfectionism, evaluation sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity, curiosity) with significant links to these domains. These results are interpreted within the larger context of the personality hierarchy whenever possible, so as to determine whether each trait appears to be (1) specifically associated with social anxiety or (2) non-specifically related to social anxiety due to overlap with other traits. We also discuss the specificity of social anxiety-trait relations vis-a-vis depression and other anxiety disorders. This review revealed that higher order E/PE, sociability, dominance, and the social concerns component of anxiety sensitivity are most specific to social anxiety, whereas other traits are shared with other disorders (primarily depression and GAD). Finally, we consider the subtypes of social anxiety (i.e., generalized and performance) and present some evidence for differential trait associations. We discuss the implications of these results for etiological issues, distinguishing social anxiety from depression and GAD, and future research directions in this area. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

177,Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification,"The classification of strengths presented in this book is intended to reclaim the study of character and virtue as legitimate topics of psychological inquiry and informed societal discourse. By providing ways of talking about character strengths and measuring them across the life span, this classification will start to make possible a science of human strengths that goes beyond armchair philosophy and political rhetoric. The authors believe that good character can be cultivated, but to do so, conceptual and empirical tools to craft and evaluate interventions are needed. This handbook focuses on what is right about people and specifically about the strengths of character that make the good life possible. The authors follow the example of the DSM and ICD and their collateral creations by proposing a classification scheme and by devising assessment strategies for each of its entries. The crucial difference is that the domain of concern is not psychological illness but psychological health. In short, the authors' goal is ""a manual of the sanities"" (Easterbrook, 2001, p. 23). The authors write from the perspective of positive psychology, which means that they are as focused on strength as on weakness, as interested in building the best things in life as in repairing the worst, and as concerned with fulfilling the lives of normal people as with healing the wounds of the distressed (Seligman, 2002).

178,Interesting things and curious people: Exploration and engagement as transient states and enduring strengths,"Curiosity, interest, and intrinsic motivation are critical to the development of competence, knowledge, and expertise. Without a mechanism of intrinsic motivation, people would rarely explore new things, learn for its own sake, or engage with uncertain tasks despite feelings of confusion and anxiety. This article explores two sides of interest: momentary feelings (the emotion of interest) and enduring traits (the character strength of curiosity). Recent theories in emotion psychology can explain why and when people experience feelings of interest; recent research has illuminated the role of curiosity in cultivating knowledge, meaning in life, close relationships, and physical and mental resilience. The problem for future research-and for social and personality psychology more generally-is how to bridge the dynamics of everyday experience with stable, lifespan aspects of personality.

180,Evaluating individual level antecedents and consequences of social media use in Ghana,"Social media use has increased tremendously over the last few years, generating immense interest in the phenomenon in both research and practice. Hence, this study takes a quantitative (survey design) approach to empirically examine the user (consumer) level factors that influence social media use, their consequences, and the moderating effects of consumer demographic variables (age and gender). The findings suggest that while external pressure from a consumer's referent group influence their social media use, the consumer's personal values does not. Moreover, social media use generates bridging social capital and subjective wellbeing among consumers. The empirical analysis also shows that consumer demographic variables (age and gender) do not have any significant differences in their use of social media. We shed light on the relative effects of these antecedents on social media use from a holistic perspective employing the social presence theory. This study also contributes to the augmentation and displacement hypotheses of computer-mediated communication and tends to support the augmentation hypothesis. The results will also be useful for firms by employing techniques that would arouse interest and curiosity to attract the attention of social media users. <c2><a9> 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Karikari, S and Osei-Frimpong, K and Owusu-Frimpong, N",0,10.1016/j.techfore.2017.06.023,134
181,"Emotion: Threat, anxiety, and hostility","Essentially, emotion is a state of generalized excitement that expresses itself in changes in feeling-tone and bodily condition. When we are enraged we feel enraged, and others are made aware of our feelings by our actions. The feeling of rage is accompanied by such bodily changes as increased blood pressure, faster heart beat, increased secretions of the adrenal glands, inhibition of the digestive processes, increased skin moisture, and a dropping or rising of the skin temperature. Similar conditions accompany or constitute the expression of other strong emotions in response to threat (for example, panic), or in response to a desire for need-satisfaction (for example, sexual passion). Some examples of emotions of a milder sort that appear in situations involving threat are feelings of irritation, boredom, annoyance, resentment, and displeasure. Still others are timidity, apprehension, shyness, and hesitancy. Emotions of a milder sort associated with need-satisfaction occur in the form of enjoyment, curiosity, interest, friendship, and acceptance.

A sample of 27 school aged children from five to seven years of age was evaluated using the Knox Preschool Play Scale and Ferland Assessment of Ludic Behavior. Play capacities and Ludic attitude were described and analyzed in relation to intellectual capacities. Children demonstrated good abilities in use of objects and space in both assessments. Furthermore, four out of six elements of the Ludic attitude: curiosity, initiative, pleasure, and spontaneity were present irrespective of IQ level. However, sense of humor and enjoyment of challenge were less present. Interestingly, the Imitation dimension showed relative weakness suggesting that this learning method may not be optimal in the school setting. The results highlight the strengths and limitations in play behaviors of children with intellectual disability.","Messier, Julie and Ferland, Francine and Majnemer, Annette",0,10.1007/s10882-007-9089-x,136
184,Psychology as a science and a profession,"The portrait of man that has emerged in the preceding chapters is one of a perceiving, remembering, thinking, motivated, emotional, acting person. His perceptions, memories, thoughts, motives, emotions, and actions are shaped by his biological make-up, by experience, and by the society in which he lives. These chapters contain some of the material that constitutes the body or corpus of psychology. In this final chapter, we intend to discuss psychology as a scientific and professional enterprise, the diverse activities in which psychologists engage, and the role of psychology in contemporary society. Our age has, correctly or incorrectly, been called the age of psychology. Incorrectly, we think, because this is the age of the atom and outer space. Correctly, we think, because of the great interest that people have taken in psychology--an interest which is motivated in part by the same urge that causes people to go to a zoo, rush to a fire, or watch a bullfight. They want excitement without danger, thrills without participation, and sensationalism without involvement. Much of the interest in psychology comes from curiosity seekers. No one can deny that some aspects of psychology are spectacular, sensational, exciting. It is titillating to learn that a boy wants to sleep with his mother and kill his father although this has been known longer than psychology has been in existence. Diderot, the French encyclopedist, said it back in the eighteenth century. It is exciting to read about sexual perversions, madness, and horrible crimes. Abnormal psychology is an absorbing subject. Many strange dramas are enacted in the theater of sleep. Fiction proves to be but a pallid reflection of the case histories of real people. Certainly, psychology is filled with drama and a large part of the audience is there to be entertained rather than informed. To the psychologist, psychology is a serious matter. It is his calling. The vocation of psychology consists of many and diverse activities. We can classify these activities under four general headings: (1) teaching, (2) research, (3) system building, and (4) application. Teaching is the transmission of knowledge; research is making additions to knowledge. System building attempts to impose order upon knowledge by developing general laws and principles. Application is the use of knowledge for practical purposes. We shall discuss each of these in turn.

I knew that deep in their hearts their curiosity was not scholarly; they were hopeful that it would offer the definitive doping guide for graduate school. These doctoral students have been self-medicating by trial and error for a decade and were longing to apply their newfound grasp of statistics, research methodology, and psychopharmacology to personally relevant aims. Their hope is not misplaced, for the book provides a marvelous overview of the current literature. The data for their doping method are there, although they require a careful reading. The students are also fortunate because the book blends the science with a pragmatic, accessible style. The mechanisms are described; however, they are set in a text that a thoughtful clinician could navigate. The book systematically documents the research on caffeine's effects on attention, mood, memory, sleep, and a broad range of cognitive and physiological measures. Each chapter is written by an eminent research group, each presenting a particular area of interest and perspective on the data. In and among the neurobiological data are hypotheses and findings from social and health psychology, creating a broadly appealing scholarly book.

The reliability and factorial validity of the scale have been adequately demonstrated. Additional validity studies with a total of 2,925 Ss in Grades 3-9 are reported. Higher-order factoring yielded 2 distinct clusters of subscales: The 1st 3 dimensions form 1 factor and are interpreted as more motivational in nature; the remaining 2 are viewed as more cognitive-informational in nature. Developmental data show that across Grades 3-9 there was a shift from intrinsic to extrinsic on the 1st motivational cluster. Conversely, there was a dramatic developmental shift from extrinsic to intrinsic on the cognitive-informational cluster. Interpretations for these developmental differences are advanced, and the educational implications are explored.

A comparison of end-of-study competency and professional habits surveys to baseline data supported a finding that learning did occur as a result of participation in the CoP. Final interviews and final focus group meetings revealed other benefits, motivators, de-motivators, and obstacles to participation. Participants were motivated to participate by the need to satisfy curiosity, interest in fun interactions, such as found in work-related challenges, in meeting personal interests and in finding relevance to current and future needs. De-motivators and obstacles included initial exposure to too much information and too many choices. Participants were de-motivated by information that lacked relevance. Obstacles to participation included conflicting priorities, not knowing participants, and technical problems. An outcome of this study was the emergence of a template of elements and activities for a CoP that could be used as a starting point for a future study of a target audience with similar needs.

196,THE VIRTUAL EXCHANGE PROJECT,"The impact of globalization on the infrastructure of healthcare now requires professional groups to have relevant cultural knowledge and skills in order to be able to deliver effective and efficient programmes of care. Whilst direct experiential healthcare learning in a different country is invaluable, technology is now well placed to blend globalization, cultural awareness and collaboration in learning and teaching. The Virtual Exchange Project is a Web-based learning and teaching application designed to bring study-elsewhere experiences into the student's own setting. Strategically the Virtual Exchange offers opportunities for cross liaison between groups of like-minded academic institutions. This collaboration is between a group of Universities, Nottingham, Queensland and Auckland and their Schools of Nursing. Within higher education the contractual processes for traditional exchange activities have often been located in parallel academic standing and similar curricula processes. Traditional exchanges have focussed on students being in a different environment often abroad, to their usual place of study. The Virtual Exchange does not seek to replace this type of activity. It adds another dimension to studying elsewhere, especially for those students whom for a range of reasons such as family commitments and financial challenges are unable to take up such opportunities. The pedagogical framework for the Virtual Exchange is based on a constructivist approach with a strong collaborative component. Whilst maintaining a balance between collaboration, activity and content, initial activity was facilitated through a light touch using socially mediated enquiry about hobbies and interests with an incremental increase in academic depth of inquiry and curiosity-driven exploration about nursing and other health related issues. Whilst learner guidance and support are imperative for the success of the project, the Virtual Exchange will be student led. A key benefit through this approach is the avoidance of information transfer and associated low motivation and engagement. In addition, the academic team from the participating Institutions have acknowledged the importance of the need for technology to support collaboration in a social environment. WebCT was chosen as its interactive structure offered opportunity for communication, participation and feedback for both staff and students. It is anticipated that evaluation and usability studies will measure the level of success by an assessment of the pedagogical moves to support the students, their encounters with and attitudes towards technology, the cultural context and the related exploratory language and the learning styles used in an online environment.","Todhunter, F and Hallawell, B and Chambers, D and Tuckett, A and Pittaway, D and Baker, H",0,,146
197,Responses to an Unfamiliar Thing: How Learning About a Structural Sculpture Can Make It More Appealing,"A collaboratively conceived and designed engineering teaching sculpture was recently installed at a small teaching-oriented engineering college. What began as an attempt to bring the AISC Steel Connections Teaching Sculpture to campus ultimately resulted in a unique structure that is both a place-based metaphor and a structural concept demonstration piece containing many of the connections from the original, oft-used AISC sculpture. The sculpture provides a poignant centerpiece for the civil engineering department as well as a platform for teaching structural analysis and design concepts throughout the curriculum. On the one hand it is a practical teaching tool: providing a bold introduction to heavy steel construction, serving as an effective visualization tool for teaching three dimensional vectors and forces via the various cable supports, and presenting to the students the various types of steel connections in a highly specialized setting that encourages both the visualization of and interaction with the steel connection elements. On the other hand, it contains a profound metaphor for a bioregion grappling with scarce water resources and declining environmental quality: a visual expression of consensus, of shared responsibility and balanced interests. It is a practical piece of art in a place where water is precariously held both in equilibrium and a constant state of tension. This paper will present a study which aimed to determine whether this unique sculpture could be used to develop in aspiring engineers a combination of social, environmental, and technical curiosity. In addition to its practical and obvious teaching possibilities toward the technical, could the sculpture-which is so striking visually that one cannot help but ask questions such as ``What is it?'', ``Why is it here?'', and ``What is it for?''-also be used to encourage the development of new, non-technical ideas that are social, environmental, or political in nature? To answer this question, the authors conducted a number of surveys to determine observers' views of and attitudes toward the sculpture. Participants included students of varying ranks and backgrounds, technical and otherwise. Students were initially surveyed to determine their attitudes toward the sculpture (ranking it on aesthetics, appropriateness, practical use as a teaching tool, and the possibility of gleaning deeper meaning from it). Students were then provided a short written interpretation describing both the technical teaching merits of the sculpture and the geocentric environmental metaphor. The same survey was conducted after the written interpretation to determine if an understanding of the artist's technical and philosophical vision as well as the practical teaching potential influenced attitudes toward the art. The results of these surveys, along with a detailed explanation of the sculpture's inception, design, construction, and status, are presented in this paper.","Riley, Charles E and St Clair, Sean",0,,147

199,Patients and doctors in dialogue about chronic illness,"A small group of patients with chronic illnesses and primary care doctors participated in a structured, facilitated dialogue about chronic illness. Using a dialogue model adapted from the Public Conversations Project (Becker, Chasin, Chasin, Herzig and Roth, 1995; Herzig, 1998) that emphasizes experience-based knowledge and the sharing of experiences across differences, participating patients and doctors learned about the influence of chronic illness in each other's lives and work. Particular emphasis was placed on areas where improvement is needed in doctor-patient relationships. The study design was based on a participatory action research approach. It employed pre-dialogue interviews to develop a dialogue focus that would address participants' concerns and orient potential participants to the attitudes and values of talking across differences. The interviews also served as a screening tool to assess the ability and willingness of potential participants to engage in a cooperative dialogue process. Through follow-up interviews and questionnaires the participants reported outcomes and assessed the utility of the dialogue as a clinical method. Narrative analysis of the data emphasized the spoken and written words of participants and provided a means to bring their voices into the ongoing national conversation about healthcare. Most topics discussed in the dialogue focused on doctor-patient relationships, including what patient participants find helpful in their relationships with their doctors and what is missing that they wish was available to them. Major issues raised through the dialogue included: differences in what patients need and doctors can provide in chronic as compared to acute illnesses, ways diagnosis functions in doctor-patient relationships in chronic illness, the occurrence of ""depression"" in chronic illness and effects of witnessing illness. Participants were also interested in aspects of chronic illness that appear to be common across various diseases. Some patients noted the caring of the doctor participants and contrasted it with how they understand experiences with their own doctors. Over a two-hour dialogue, the participants moved the tone from one of interest and curiosity to one of deeply felt connection that facilitated learning and generated hope. Implications for patients, doctors and chronic illness care were addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Lockerman, Georgene R",0,,149

203,Forty years of research into the history of education in denmark,"Although the history of formal education in the Nordic countries has relatively long roots, its broader and more systematic study started early in our century then gained momentum during the second half. But the formal educational systems in the Nordic countries vary to a high degree due to geographical, political and economical circumstances, and so do their histories. The three articles in this section survey studies of the history of education in Denmark, Finland and Norway, particularly during the last four decades and they tell rather different stories. The Danish contribution shows how studies have been motivated by higher educational needs for readings about the history of education and by researchers' curiosity to detect causes of occurrences and developments as well as their consequences. The second article outlines the Finnish development by means of a chronological (1940-1960, 1960-1980, 1980-1990) and thematic division. Finland was influenced in this research area by Germany, but this influence lay dormant after the Second World War until the 1970s. Naturally the study of the Finnish history of education has a particular interest because of this nation's turbulent historical past and special current geographical and political position. The Norwegian article starts with a pessimistic confession that Norwegian historical pedagogy today seems to be on the defensive and marginalized, but it finds comfort in the fact that a new generation of researchers have entered the scene. The contrast between the older and the new generation in their views about research topics, trends and thematic orientations is then followed and documented throughout the article. Thus the firm documentation shows that there is a trend within the new generation to study recent history at the sacrifice of the ancient, to prefer the study of history from below instead of history from above, to choose more enthusiastically the study of social powers and structures instead of the history of ideas and persons, and to focus on the study of foreign pedagogic in order to establish a kind of standard to measure Norwegian developmental excellence against, instead of focusing on the study of foreign pedagogic per se. The article ends with viewpoints on the role that theoretical scientific reflections could play in educational history research, and it presents the contemporary scene with it's problems and promises. <c2><a9> 1997 Carfax Publishing Ltd.","Skovgaard-Petersen, V",0,10.1080/0031383970410310,152

205,Deconstructing PTSD: constructing a sociopolitical response to violence against women [dissertation],"This theoretical dissertation uses social constructionism to explore some of the meanings, interpretations, and responses to violence against women in the United States, with a focus on psychology and the mental health field. It raises questions about the consequences of one possible sequela of that violence, a diagnosis of PTSD. Using a feminist standpoint epistemology, this paper examines some of the domains that support violence against women, including patriarchy, sexism, the gender system, and social discourse. Deconstruction uses a political analysis to consider the ways in which a generally accepted meaning can function to support the interests of the dominant group. I deconstruct representations imbedded within the PTSD diagnosis to crystallize awareness about its constructed nature and to evoke curiosity about the relationship between the diagnosis and psychologists' professional response. Using general systems theory as a framework, this paper suggests that there are differential benefits and costs of the diagnosis of PTSD for individual women, for women as a group, and for society in general. The diagnosis may have contributed to the depoliticizing of abuse against women; its current use may have beneficial effects for some individual women, but it has not always served either women as a group or society overall. This paper proposes a sociopolitical response to violence against women that integrates the personal and the political, thus potentially better serving the interests of the individual, the group, and society. Interventions that address each of these levels and some of their benefits and costs are suggested for psychologists to consider. A psychology-politics dialectic is a critical underpinning to interventions that challenge and confront the status quo. Paulo Freire suggested that the struggle for freedom and equality can be considered an act of love that benefits all members of society, those with more and less privilege. Extrapolating from his work, this paper advocates activism on the part of psychologists and other mental health clinicians in the interests of creating a society where women and men can live together in peace.

206,The relationship between curiosity and metacognition within an educational setting,"The paper presents two experiments which aim to clarify existing relationships between knowledge of a specific field, overconfidence and interest in it, within an educational setting. In the first experiment, first and third year students of Compulsory Secondary Education assessed the extent of their own knowledge and interest on the topic of ""nutrition"", before and after taking an exam on the subject. First year students showed greater overconfidence than did those in the third year regarding the extent of their knowledge, even after taking the exam. In both academic years, interest was correlated with perceived knowledge, but not with the real knowledge shown in the test. In the second experiment, the students were given reports with their exam result, though these were randomly handed out and had no relationship with their real scores. Positive reports, informing students that they were knowledgeable on the subject, resulted in an increase of interest on the subject, while negative reports informing them of their lack of knowledge caused a decrease of interest.

207,Hiding in plain sight: Functional neurological disorders in the news,"Objective: Functional movement and seizure disorders are still widely misunderstood and receive little public and academic attention. This is in stark contrast to their high prevalence and levels of associated disability. In an exploratory observational study, the authors examined whether the relative lack of media coverage of functional neurological disorders is in part due to misidentification in ""human interest"" news stories. Methods: Thirteen recent news stories from high-impact English-language media outlets that portrayed patients with complex symptoms either attributed to other diagnoses or presented as medical mysteries were identified using online keyword searches. All selected news stories contained video or still images displaying relevant symptoms. Cases were categorized into movement disorders or seizure disorders and were then independently assessed by 10 respective expert raters. For each category, one story of a patient whose symptoms were due to a well-recognized neurological disease was also included. Both the diagnostic category and the respective confidence level were reported by each rater for each case. The interrater agreement was calculated for each group of disorders. Results: The raters confirmed almost unanimously that all presented news stories except the negative control cases portrayed misidentified functional movement or seizure disorders. The interrater agreement and average diagnostic confidence were high. Conclusions: Functional neurological disorders are often wrongly considered a rare medical curiosity of the past. However, these findings suggest that, while they are largely absent from public discourse, they often appear in the news incognito, hiding in plain sight.

208,"Is the feeling of strangeness necessary? ""Savage mind"" and stranger anxiety in the prism of Trobriand socialization","This paper deals with stranger anxiety of the infant against the backdrop of findings of the author's field research into the society of the Trobriand islanders. The author describes irritating aspects of the ""savage mind"" by means of exploring the mythical Trobriand parthenogenesis. An examination of the extreme stranger anxiety of the Trobriand infant brings to light that this stranger anxiety points to the extent of the infant's dependence on the social structure for maintaining its psychic balance. As such, stranger anxiety can be interpreted as not only as a precursor of both real and signal anxiety, but also as a precondition for curiosity and interest in the unknown. It is one of the unresolvable paradoxes of human existence; coping therewith belongs to the essential tasks of life.

210,Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing,"The concept of ""college readiness"" is increasingly important in discussions about students' preparation for postsecondary education. This Framework describes the rhetorical and twenty-first-century skills as well as habits of mind and experiences that are critical for college success. Based in current research in writing and writing pedagogy, the Framework was written and reviewed by two- and four-year college and high school writing faculty nationwide and is endorsed by the Council of Writing Program Administrators, the National Council of Teachers of English, and the National Writing Project. Habits of mind refers to ways of approaching learning that are both intellectual and practical and that will support students' success in a variety of fields and disciplines. The Framework identifies eight habits of mind essential for success in college writing: (1) Curiosity--the desire to know more about the world; (2) Openness--the willingness to consider new ways of being and thinking in the world; (3) Engagement--a sense of investment and involvement in learning; (4) Creativity--the ability to use novel approaches for generating, investigating, and representing ideas; (5) Persistence--the ability to sustain interest in and attention to short- and long-term projects; (6) Responsibility--the ability to take ownership of one's actions and understand the consequences of those actions for oneself and others; (7) Flexibility--the ability to adapt to situations, expectations, or demands; and (8) Metacognition--the ability to reflect on one's own thinking as well as on the individual and cultural processes used to structure knowledge. The Framework then explains how teachers can foster these habits of mind through writing, reading, and critical analysis experiences. These experiences aim to develop students': (1) Rhetorical knowledge--the ability to analyze and act on understandings of audiences, purposes, and comprehending texts; (2) Critical thinking--the ability to analyze a situation or text and make thoughtful decisions based on that analysis, through writing, reading, and research; (3) Writing processes--multiple strategies to approach and undertake writing and research; (4) Knowledge of conventions--the formal and informal guidelines that define what is considered to be correct and appropriate, or incorrect and inappropriate, in a piece of writing; and (5) Ability to compose in multiple environments--from traditional pen and paper to electronic technologies.

211,Ethic dimension in health research focusing on the qualitative approach,"This article addresses the ethical dimension in health research, relating it more specifically to the qualitative approach, based on contributions of the social sciences and ethnography in particular, as it presupposes building a relationship of trust and respect between researchers and researched subjects that is gradually configured. The ethical aspects permeate qualitative research from the choice of the subject matter, the methodological outlines, analysis of the results, to the commitment of providing a feedback for the researched subjects regarding the obtained information. The ethical aspects presuppose the value of an interpersonal relationship in which the different interests, values and worldviews stand as a possibility or not of a joint construction of knowledge. The choice of a subject or object of study is related to a particular life trajectory in which the researcher should ask himself, at all times, how to conciliate the constitution of an ethical attitude in relation to the researched subjects with his own desires, dreams, curiosities and expectations. The article aims to discuss such dilemmas experienced by the researcher, highlighting the importance of ethics for his personal, professional and socio-political growth, and emphasizing the desire for knowledge autonomy, solidarity with social groups and with people involved in the research. Based on the report of a research process, the article intends to contribute to the understanding of how ethical aspects are inextricably linked to research, and also to the researcher, bringing elements to the conduction of qualitative research especially in public health.","e Silva, C R C and Mendes, R and Nakamura, E",0,,159

214,Early childhood teacher candidates' qualifications in science teaching,"In recent years, researchers and educators have been paying more attention to science education in early ages of children. Children's innate curiosity and interest in science, as well as the development and learning benefits of early childhood science instruction, are encouraging researchers and educators to study how to raise the quality of science education in early childhood education centers. Since the `teacher' is one of the factors that either increases or decreases the quality of education, educators and researchers are looking for the ways to support early childhood teachers in science content and science education. To accomplish that, it is essential to determine the strengths and weaknesses of teachers in science teaching. The study is conducted to see if teacher candidates are qualified enough to teach science. In other words, the current study is interested in understanding early childhood education teacher candidates' qualifications in teaching young children science content and helping them develop science process skills. The results of the study are stated in the paper.","Alisinanoglu, Fatma and Inan, Hatice Zeynep and Ozbey, Saide and Usak, Muhammed",0,,161

221,FLEX: A Foreign Language Experience,"An exploratory course was designed to give secondary school students exposure to all languages in the foreign language curriculum, in sequence, so they may decide which, if any, to enroll in. This course was begun in 1979 to counter an elitist image of foreign language courses. Course topics encouraged students to explore the languages fully by: being activity-oriented; facilitating adaptation to new sound and grammatical systems; dealing with major cultural concepts; including intriguing sounds, expressions, and gestures of the target languages; addressing the relationship of geography to occupations, food, clothing, and so on; dealing with the language's history and contributions to American culture; attempting to elicit interest in the target countries; being addressed, when possible, in a single class period; encouraging values clarification; and promoting career awareness. The languages (French, German, Latin, and Spanish) each were responsible for 20-22 class meetings during the semester. Each of the four language teachers involved developed activities from the standard unit topics provided. The course has been well received by teachers, students, parents, and administrators. Appended materials include: lists of specific activities for each language, a 1982-83 course schedule, results of teacher and student surveys regarding the course, student grade statistics for 1981-82, and the district's total foreign language enrollments for the fall semesters of 1975 through 1982.

229,Professional fulfillment and parenting work-life balance in female physicians in Basic Sciences and medical research: A nationwide cross-sectional survey of all 80 medical schools in Japan,"Background: In Japan, the field of Basic Sciences encompasses clinical, academic, and translational research, as well as the teaching of medical sciences, with both an MD and PhD typically required. In this study, it was hypothesized that the characteristics of a Basic Sciences career path could offer the professional advancement and personal fulfillment that many female medical doctors would find advantageous. Moreover, encouraging interest in Basic Sciences could help stem shortages that Japan is experiencing in medical fields, as noted in the three principal contributing factors: premature resignation of female clinicians, an imbalance of female physicians engaged in research, and a shortage of medical doctors in the Basic Sciences. This study examines the professional and personal fulfillment expressed by Japanese female medical doctors who hold positions in Basic Sciences. Topics include career advancement, interest in medical research, and greater flexibility for parenting. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was distributed at all 80 medical schools in Japan, directed to 228 female medical doctors whose academic rank was assistant professor or higher in departments of Basic Sciences in 2012. Chi-square tests and the binary logistic regression model were used to investigate the impact of parenthood on career satisfaction, academic rank, salary, etc. Results: The survey response rate of female physicians in Basic Sciences was 54.0%. Regardless of parental status, one in three respondents cited research interest as their rationale for entering Basic Sciences, well over twice other motivations. A majority had clinical experience, with clinical duties maintained part-time by about half of respondents and particularly parents. Only one third expressed afterthoughts about relinquishing full-time clinical practice, with physicians who were parents expressing stronger regrets. Parental status had little effect on academic rank and income within the Basic Sciences, Conclusion: Scientific curiosity and a desire to improve community health are hallmarks of those choosing a challenging career in medicine. Therefore, it is unsurprising that interest in research is the primary motivation for a female medical doctor to choose a career in Basic Sciences. Additionally, as with many young professionals with families, female doctors seek balance in professional and private lives. Although many expressed afterthoughts relinquishing a full-time clinical practice, mothers generally benefited from greater job flexibility, with little significant effect on career development and income as Basic Scientists. <c2><a9> 2017 The Author(s).","Yamazaki, Y and Uka, T and Marui, E",0,10.1186/s12960-017-0241-0,170
230,Curiosity has comprehensive benefits in the workplace: Developing and validating a multidimensional workplace curiosity scale in United States and German employees,"Curiosity is a fundamental human motive that is beginning to garner closer attention by researchers and practitioners interested in workplace functioning. Recent work suggests that rather than designating someone as possessing curiosity or not, there is benefit in detailing the various elements of curiosity. To date, there is no research on how multiple dimensions of curiosity operate in the workplace. Across four samples, we developed and validated the M-Workplace Curiosity Scale. Participants were American and German employees from a range of industries. We found evidence for four workplace curiosity dimensions: Joyous Exploration, Deprivation Sensitivity, Stress Tolerance, and Openness to Peoples Ideas. These workplace curiosity dimensions predicted a substantial amount of variance in adaptive outcomes including job satisfaction, work engagement, job crafting, healthy work relationships, and innovation; as a test of construct specificity, workplace curiosity outperformed trait mindfulness in predicting each of these workplace outcomes. Results offer support for a comprehensive model of curiosity that identifies high performing, satisfied individuals in the workplace. These findings underscore the importance of understanding, assessing, leveraging, and developing curiosity in teams and organizations.","Kashdan, Todd B and Goodman, Fallon R and Disabato, David J and McKnight, Patrick E and Kelso, Kerry and Naughton, Carl",0,10.1016/j.paid.2019.109717,171
231,"Language arts: Explore, create, discover through inquiry","Inquiry's many different shapes reflect diverse students' interests and intellects. As an act of language, inquiry is born in dialogue. And the dialogue of real discussion supports the reading, writing, thinking, listening, and speaking that meet the National Standards for the English Language Arts (National Council of Teachers of English & International Reading Association [NCTE/IRA], 1996). Opportunities for such dialogue cross the curriculum, but they come to special fruition in talk about literary characters' plights and possibilities. When students are collectively engaged in imaginative wonderings about issues of compelling human interest, the resulting dialogue supports their intellectual and social development in powerful ways. What opportunities, then, do students have to express and explore their inquiries in a language arts class? Authentic classroom discussions where students engage actively and ask substantive questions of personal interest are possible, and talk about literature seems to offer a particularly inviting context for such wondering (Almasi, O'Flahavan, & Arya, 2001; Hadjioannou, 2003; Townsend, 1998).

232,Positive professional leaders: Aspects to consider in leadership development,"Purpose: The purpose of this article is to make explicit a number of positive views that professionals have about assuming formal leadership positions and relating those aspects to leadership development. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 17 leaders in the pharmaceutical industry were interviewed about their perceptions of leadership. A challenging interview technique was developed in order to elicit reflections on leadership. The interviews were analysed with regard to content. Findings: The oxymoronic nature of professionals as leaders was confirmed but a more comprehensive picture was obtained. Positive aspects of the leadership role were identified: reward for good scientific work, increased influence over scientific processes, and tutoring and developing colleagues. Interest, curiosity and the ability to discuss and learn more about leadership were displayed. By drawing on the devotion to science, those positive aspects should be used in leadership development, e.g. relating scientific tutoring to leadership skills and clarifying the importance of leadership for successful scientific work. The activities should have a challenging approach. Research limitations/implications: The result might have been different if leaders from additional organisational levels, or from a less successful R&D site, had been interviewed. Practical implications: The increased merging of professional and leadership roles makes the findings important. Results are actionable in that human resource departments can take advantage of the findings when training and preparing scientists for leadership positions. Originality/value: This paper offers an alternative view of professionals in the leadership role to the view traditionally put forth in the literature.

Instructors tend to focus on presentation of learning materials based on overall learning goals in a course rather than personalizing the presentation for each student. The ultimate goal of Pique is to provide learners with content that will encourage their curiosity to learn more by presenting sequences of papers with increasingly more novel content. We piloted Pique with students in a course and report on their responses to the recommended sequences.

234,The learning process from the standpoint of behaviorism,"In the preceding chapters we have traced the process by which the development of physiological psychology led into behaviorism. It is to be expected that a development of this kind would have an extensive influence on educational theory. This influence became evident long before the development had culminated in the behavioristic psychology of the present day. How this came about is easily pointed out. The study of the body in its relation to the facts of psychology naturally emphasized such matters as instincts, tendencies, and impulses. In earlier times these things were mainly disregarded. Thus the disposition of the child to play, to draw and paint and construct things, was usually treated as more or less of a nuisance, since it interfered with the high purpose of making the child learn the things which were in the book and which he would need for the affairs of adult life. At best this disposition was regarded as due to frivolity and irresponsibility; very often it was classed as evidence of inherent depravity. The business of education was not to exploit this disposition so as to make it contribute to mental development, but to ignore and perhaps even to suppress it. When we deal with childhood from the point of view of physiological psychology, however, the matter tends to assume a very different aspect. We have learned to think of the child as an organism full of explosive energy, which is set off by the solicitations of the environment in somewhat the same way that a firecracker is set off by a match. The infant comes into the world with the capacity or tendency to react in various typical ways, which we call by such names as fear, rage, curiosity, vocalization, reaching, grasping, and the like. One of the characteristic traits of modern education is the insistence that teaching must take its point of departure from these native tendencies, or capacities, of childhood. In terms of the Herbartian Five Steps, the teacher must first arouse or revive certain of the pupil's earlier experiences (the step of Preparation), and then must add certain new material (the step of Presentation). The remaining steps then necessarily follow in their appointed order. No matter how much the Herbartians may talk about self-activity, the starting point is a condition of passivity, because the pupil is supposed to operate with a certain material called sensations or impressions. Teaching then becomes a matter of following a certain fixed order of steps, more or less as a cook follows a recipe. Consequently the advantage of recognizing interest and the need of psychological organization was largely lost. In brief, then, the trouble with Herbartianism is that the doctrine of mental states resulted in a fundamental misconception of the learning process. This chapter discusses the effect of behaviorism on the understanding of the learning process.

238,AT STUDENTS' SERVICE - TUTORING AND COACHING AS INNOVATIVE METHODS OF,"A proposed paper presents academic Tutoring and Coaching as innovative methods of personalized teaching and learning, aimed at maintaining/preserving and developing high quality education at the contemporary university. Both methods constitute a didactic offer which apparently seems contradictory with the assumptions of Higher Education (HE) reforms, conducted recently in Poland and in Europe and directed at marketisation and commodification of education. This impression might be caused by the fact that Tutoring and Coaching refer back to the rooted in the Anglo-Saxon tradition of individualized teaching by a Tutor or Coach, who cares for a complex intellectual, cognitive and psycho-social (i. e. also emotional) development of his/her student. The idea of re-introducing elements of personalized education in the formula of Tutoring, Coaching and even Mentoring occur in progressive academic milieus as an alternative to purely pragmatic and depersonalized relationship between students and teachers. They evoke curiosity among academic researchers, as they assume unique, slightly forgotten in the contemporary practice of mass education ties between Master and Pupil, being per se a primary form of reciprocal stimulation of passion, interests and exchange of knowledge between two Subjects. As both discussed methods are directed at raising the efficacy of a teaching/learning process, they shall also be analyzed in the context of restructuring educational systems and changing requirements as for human/intellectual capital, driven by the processes of Europeanization and globalization of university/tertiary education. When professionally applied, Tutoring and Coaching stand a chance to become the best, if not the only tools to preserve the elite level of HE for those individuals (both teachers and students) who are ready to face an intellectual challenge, and who want to continue their personal development instead of only getting a diploma to fit the labor market. In this approach, Tutoring and Coaching turn into the measurable/institutionalized instruments to raise the quality of HE, and their application can be viewed as a factor which decides about the Institution's competitiveness. In the proposed article, general features of Tutoring as an academic method shall be enlisted alongside the assumptions of Coaching, the objective of which is, as it shall be argued, deepening of personalized teaching efficiency. The purpose of this juxtaposition shall be highlighting the points at which both approaches complement each other in order to provide a student with optimal conditions not only to widen his declarative or pragmatic knowledge, but also to develop his/her cognitive and emotional attitudes. The latter constitute the basis for successful learning and knowledge processing (re.: S. Krashen's Emotional Filter Hypothesis). Thus, Coaching shall be presented as an effective way of drawing students to their highest cognitive potentials by means of awakening their self-reflection over own goals, aptitudes and weaknesses meaningful to their learning process. Reaching this level of reflectivity is indispensable to successively build their knowledge capital, which in turn takes place in the personalized didactic dialogue with a Tutor: a leader, a coordinator and a source of professional knowledge in one. The authors also assume that combining Tutoring and Coaching as methods of teaching constitutes a highly competitive offer for HE pushed into the frames of European Qualification Framework. The objective will be to insert a postulated didactic approach in the administrative triple division of educational goals and effects formulated as knowledge, skills and attitudes (social skills). Accordingly, it shall be argued that personalized education may go in line with administrative rules of democratic education, and simultaneously serve the individual, autonomous student.","Karpinska-Musial, Beata and Dziedziczak-Foltyn, Agnieszka",0,,177
241,Children's university at Budapest University of technology and economics,"The very first edition of the Children's University summer camp intended to primary school students was organized in 2015 at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME). Since then, we held the summer camp every year. The concept of the Children's University was similar to that of several foreign initiatives but the camp was unique in its form and content. Our aims were i) to show the 8-14 year old students -through colorful and diverting activities- the amazing richness of scientific fields covered by BME and ii) to stimulate their curiosity for natural sciences and technology. Our one week program consisted in lectures and seminars and was closed by a symbolic graduation ceremony. In addition, during the week children worked on projects in teams so that they could improve their cooperative skills. At the end of the week a satisfaction survey was given to the parents and students to get their feedback on the camp. We summarize the results of the surveys taken in 2018.

244,Can't See the Wood for the Trees? What Forest School Can Do for Science,"Originating in Scandinavia, Forest School is a form of child-centred outdoor education with an ethos of promoting children's independence and raising children's self-esteem. It also allows children to pursue their own interests and fosters curiosity in the natural world. The emphasis on child-led learning within a framework of tight boundaries and expectations allows the children to have the confidence to learn new skills and try things out for themselves. In this article, Jenny Hayward, who has been involved in delivering Forest School sessions for almost five years, explores the impact Forest School can have for learners. Forest School, which has strong cross-curricular links, should be regarded as something that is uniquely positioned to support the development of enquiring minds and positive learning attitudes. Such attributes are key components in the effective development of children's scientific education.","Hayward, Jenny",0,,180
245,The Use of Technology in Educational Teaching,"Today, Information and communication technology has become a way of life in which children are drawn. Today's children are beginning to use digital tools at a very young age, so that the school should respond to the needs of students. Also today it is impossible for any profession performs without the help of information technology. The computer and the Internet gives us endless possibilities and resources in improving the quality of work. Even in education, computer skills and additional equipment are needed, because they create great opportunities for teachers and inspire curiosity, imagination and interest of students.Teachers should not oppose change, but they should use new technology for better quality teaching and make it more interesting. The use of technology will positively improve results faculty and students. Teachers must carefully plan the use and integration of technology in teaching. How to integrate technology into teaching mainly depends on how many computers has at its disposal.","Murati, Rabije and Ceka, Ardita",0,,181
246,Treatment and management of child pornography use,"The current article focuses on the treatment and management of child pornography use. Individuals who genuinely accessed child pornography out of curiosity or as part of nonsexual thrill seeking are unlikely to have a paraphilic disorder. However, many individuals will claim accidental access or curiosity as a motivation, and the credibility of these explanations requires a comprehensive sexological assessment. Individuals who access child pornography as part of a pattern of hypersexual or compulsive behavior share treatment needs with those who access child pornography because it reflects their sexual interest in children. Namely, both groups of individuals are likely to require treatment emphasizing increased self-regulation skills in the sexual domain delivered in the form of cognitive-behavioral therapy and possibly with the aid of sex drive-reducing medications. Sexual self-regulation deficits are the one domain where child pornography offenders have been found to score higher than contact sex offenders. Research is beginning to emerge on the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of online child pornography offenders. There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the different trajectories individuals might follow to child pornography use, beginning with broad distinctions between paraphilic motivations (such as pedophilia or hebephilia), hypersexuality, and less overtly sexual motivations, such as thrill seeking or curiosity.

247,"Philosophy of conduct: A treatise of the facts, principles, and ideals of ethics","The number of voluminous works dealing with man's moral life and moral development which have recently appeared has been by no means inconsiderable. Among these some have been especially noteworthy, both for the array of phenomena which they have marshalled, and also for the scientific spirit and method which have characterized their treatment of these phenomena. It is difficult to say how much this fact discloses as to the revival of a more profound and vital interest in the study of morality--properly so-called. Doubtless the history of the evolution of the race on the side of manners and morals arouses in many minds only the same kind of curiosity as that to which the sciences of biology and anthropology are so vigorously ministering, all over the scientific world, at the present time. But such interest is by no means necessarily the equivalent of that which is demanded by the kind of inquiry upon which I have entered in this volume. For this inquiry proposes at least to raise, even if it cannot completely answer, the more ultimate problems of conduct as our experience forces them upon the reflective thinking of mankind. I have, therefore, called this treatise of human moral life and moral development a ""Philosophy of Conduct."" In Part First, the nature of the Moral Self, or of man as equipped for the life of conduct, has been described as this nature appears in the light of psychological science, both individual and ethnic. In Part Second, which treats of the Virtuous Life, it has been my aim to show how, in spite of the bewildering variety of opinions and practices which has always existed, there is still, and, so far as can be discovered, always has been, a very substantial agreement touching the characteristic traits and habitual practices of the ""good man."" And, finally, in Part Third I have discussed the Nature of the Right. It is, of course, this Part in which the method of philosophy is most prominently and unmistakably employed.

250,Building knowledge about quality of life for urban planning,"The comprehensive notion of community quality of life holds important opportunities for planning. Popular interest in the subject, both as a curiosity and as a goal of many interest groups, may assist with the public relations of planning and may provide a basis for negotiating consensus in planning goals. To date, planners have focused largely on individual elements of quality of life, such as transportation or housing; they have not defined and measured systematically the comprehensive community quality of life. This article describes a research method suitable for planning and contrasts it with alternative social science approaches that yield different results. The community-trend method stresses the role of quality of life within a system of ongoing development processes. The method also seeks greater policy relevance by grounding the measurements in local political reality. <c2><a9> 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Myers, D",0,10.1080/01944368808976495,186

He was unique in his ability to bring together innovative technology, solid engineering, and academic research credentials while maintaining interest in both peripheral and electroencephalography (EEG) biofeedback. In short, he was the perfect person to represent the best science for these emerging fields. Whereas most researchers at that time used existing equipment and focused on raw signals from single muscle fibers, Tom took a much different route, a route that helped broaden the audience for a new clinical specialty, biofeedback. He also co-engineered a novel surface electromyography (EMG) biofeedback device. Using this device, he discovered that if a person learns to sustain very low levels of forehead muscle tension a more generalized relaxation effect occurs involving the autonomic nervous system. Twilight Learning grew out of his curiosity about finding simpler ways to help people relax or sleep. Tom explored other potential solutions to avoid awake, critical screening. He remained interested in brain lateralization experiments. His passion for science was contagious; his work ethic extraordinary. His continuous inquiry persisted well beyond his retirement.

255,The status quo of China's contemporary college students' affective diathesis and its influencing factors,"A large-scale research on the affective diathesis of college students in China is a significant though challenging endeavor. Based upon the theory of affective diathesis and thoughts of developmental affection with classified thoughts, current study developed an original investigative tool with solid reliability and validity-""Questionnaire on College Students' Affective Diathesis"". This instrument dealt with the complexities in affect measurement and is of great theoretical and practical significance. The questionnaire was used to investigate college students' affect development on thirty-three different kinds of affects, including patriotism, responsibility, integrity, credibility, dedication, fairness, public benefit; curiosity, exploration, self-confidence, achievements, learning happiness, major interest; intimacy, cooperation, forgiveness, emotionally appealing, gratefulness, care; self-improvement, self-reliance, self-esteem, cherish, happiness, optimism; aesthetic for nature, aesthetic for humanity, aesthetic for science, aesthetic for deportment; emotional understanding ability, emotional expression ability, emotional control of oneself, emotional control of others. They belong to six categories (moral affection, rational affection, interpersonal affection, life affection, aesthetic affection and emotional intelligence) evolving from the identity layer of affection and the operational layer of affection. The questionnaire was administered to 11982 college students, including vocational college students and university students. The geological regions encompassed well-developed, developing and less-developed regions in China involving 100 colleges and universities of 14 major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Changchun, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Wuhan, Xining, Lanzhou, Guiyang, Nanning, Haikou, and Kunming). The results showed: (1) The questionnaire meets the criteria of an effective measurement tool and serves as an original investigative tool for affective diathesis of college students. (2) The college students' affective diathesis has a multilevel structure. On the whole, the affective diathesis of college students in China is positive. The developmental level of moral affection and life affection is relatively higher, and the developmental level of interpersonal affection, aesthetic affection, rational affection and emotional intelligence were relatively lower. Affections of integrity, public benefit, dedication, exploration, learning happiness, self-confidence, forgiveness, intimacy, emotionally appealing, aesthetic for humanity, aesthetic for science and ability of emotional expression were still in urgent need of improvement. (3) A structural difference mainly existed between males and females. Females scored higher in intimacy, emotionally appealing and self-esteem, but males performed better on integrity, curiosity, exploration, self-confidence, aesthetic for science and emotional expression. (4) Those who received awards, reported achieving higher academic performance, or experienced no negative life events showed higher level of affective diathesis, especially reflected in self-confidence, achievements, learning happiness, self-improvement, happiness etc. (5) The factors affecting the affective diathesis development of the college students mainly derived from four aspects: individuals, families, schools and society. Strong interpersonal relationship, more public awareness, sound moral values, high self-expectations, democratic family education style et al. all had positive effects on college students' affective diathesis. This investigation equips educators with abundant first-hand information on how to improve the affective diathesis of college students as well as for academics on the theoretical implications for affective diathesis research.

256,Science for Living- 5 Science Topics of Common Interest to Religion and Society,"In Gobekli Tepe' near Urfa, an ancient city in southeastern Turkey, stand 11,000 year old concentric rings of old massive T shaped pillars. The carvings by prehistoric, pre-agricultural people emphasize predators, and vultures in particular are even more prominent. Archaeologists and anthropologists believe that the vultures represented the aspiration of humans to reach high into the heavens. If the scientific thought and technological output is a measure, science has been in the same pursuit along with religion or perhaps before it, even in Gobekli Tepe. While scientific topics remain at the core of human curiosity and spirituality even today, modern science has advanced tremendously, particularly over the last two centuries, leaving the general public unconnected with science. While, the public have benefited increasingly from the technological fruits of science and science has become an integral part of their life, they have been increasingly unaware that science provides real and accessible answers to personal and societal questions. In some circles, this has bred distrust of science and its process, where personal questions are concerned. To those involved closely with science, the scientific knowledge and effort are inspirational and the scientific understanding of Nature creates a sense of awe. This book attempts to give a sense of this scientific knowledge in basic science topics while providing a social and religious context. It demonstrates to the readers that science progresses with integrity in methodology and arrives at conclusions that are robust and yet open to modification. By familiarizing the readers on the science discoveries in major areas, the book is intended to persuade the reader that science takes the high road to finding knowledge and therefore is to be trusted in its conclusions, when one is confronted by apparent contradictions or denials from personal, cultural and religious perspectives. Even for the section of people who are very religious, it is shown that, in most areas, religions are not against science and do not deny scientific conclusions. With a unique approach of describing the development, the methods and the content in each topic and then following it up with religious or social perspectives on the science, the book is a guide to understand the importance of science in one's personal life and how integral it is to that life. This way, the book attempts to achieve parity of science with religion and spirituality which, in many societies, have a tremendous influence in daily life. In the introductory chapter of this book, the history of sciences and the past and current social perspectives are presented. The main body of the book takes the reader through five science topics of common interest to science, society and religion: Evolution, Medicine and Healing, Order and Disorder, Space and Time and Cosmology. Each chapter presents the historical background and introduces the fundamental scientific concepts involved on one topic, with details to get a correct understanding of the science of that topic. The subject is presented in such a way that average readers would appreciate the science, and more complicated details are given separately for readers who interested in such details. The book differs from usual popular science books in not oversimplifying concepts so that these are not misunderstood. With each topic, the conflict and agreement with Christianity, Hindu and Islamic viewpoints and an assessment of society's response are presented. The book notes or summarizes scholarly discussions and presents the simpler public discourse influenced by religious belief and scholarly debates. The final chapter discusses why science needs to be integrated in daily life by everyone and how this can be done. It advocates adoption of the scientific attitude in individual, public and corporate matters, since this leads to the way of conducting one's life with integrity and respect. <c2><a9> 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

260,Socially responsible engineering education through assistive robotics projects: The RoboWaiter competition,"This paper proposes an approach to promote students' social awareness as part of challenging projects in robot design. A new robot contest was developed to motivate and focus these projects: RoboWaiter, the first international robot competition in the rapidly growing area of assistive robotics. RoboWaiter has been held since 2009 in Hartford, Connecticut in conjunction with the annual international Trinity College Fire-Fighting Home Robot Contest. We describe how dialogue among the authors and members of the Connecticut Council on Developmental Disabilities (CTCDD) directed development of RoboWaiter and led the CTCDD actively to participate in the organization and execution of the contest. We discuss the assignment and rules of the competition as well as the engineering challenges associated with designing robots for RoboWaiter. We also present responses of contest participants, both engineering students and people with disabilities. These reflections indicate that the challenge of creating a fetch-and-carry robot raised curiosity among engineering students and increased their interest in participating in the project. Moreover, the RoboWaiter project helped students to recognize the social challenge of assistive robotics and to understand that engineering work has importance beyond pure technical achievement. Participation of people with disabilities in the robot contest was motivated by the wish to draw public attention to the need for new assistive technologies and to inspire socially responsible education in universities and schools.

It establishes steps to build a workshop for teachers and day care providers, sharing tips and advice and displaying books and materials which parents can use in their homes. After discussing parent involvement in young children's motivation and education, the paper focuses on inciting curiosity while developing reading readiness skills through everyday fun activities; cultivating curiosity through preparation of the environment with parents as educated preparers and observers; reading aloud to promote curiosity; sharing books with all children; supporting curiosity by encouraging young children's participation in work around the house; and promoting curiosity by knowing how children learn (keeping activities simple and age appropriate). The paper describes the workshop, which is from 1 1/2-2 hours long. It explains ways that teachers and caregivers can help parents create curiosity (e.g., talk, play, sing, and dance; make time to read; make reading relevant; and use technology). It explains how children, families, teachers, daycare providers, the community, and the world benefit from encouraging curiosity in children. Relevant books, magazines, and audiotapes are listed.

266,Teaching with Twitter: Not for the Faint of Heart,"Asking 250 students to post questions on Twitter during a class doesn't risk life or limb. But it can cause ego damage if students get disorderly online. Opening up a Twitter-powered channel in class--which professors at other universities are experimenting with as well--alters classroom power dynamics and signals to students that they're in control. Fans of the approach applaud technology that promises to change professors' role from ""sage on the stage"" to ""guide on the side."" Those phrases are familiar to education reformers, who have long argued that education must be more interactive to hold the interest of today's students. The unanswered question, though, is whether that theory can work in practice. That uncertainty actually excites daredevil professors attempting this teaching trick. Many colleagues are watching such experiments with a mix of curiosity and disbelief to see how the professors land. The experiments went pretty well (no real disasters), but setting up a back channel is not for every professor, or every course. Students seem to love the chance to make their voices heard in class without having to actually speak. Instructors in the classroom, however, really have to teach toward their personalities because some say this would make them uncomfortable.","Young, Jeffrey R",0,,196

A total of 376 undergraduates completed anonymous questionnaires about their responses to news coverage of the events of September 11. The study examined the extent to which individual differences in empathy gave rise to news viewing motives (surveillance, reassurance, curiosity), and how these variables, as well as negative emotional responses (anger, sadness, fear), were related to news interest and exposure. Both empathy and emotional responses were associated in predictable ways with interest in news coverage and selective exposure to specific types of news stories (e.g., casualty news, positive news). The results demonstrate that considering affective motivations can enrich our understanding of how and why people use news media.

There were many similarities across the two samples with regard to demographic characteristics, criminal history and explanations. Many offenders in both samples admitted possession of child pornography, a majority admitted they deliberately accessed child pornography, and substantial minorities acknowledged their sexual interest in child pornography and/or children. Similar proportions claimed curiosity or accidental access. Relatively few offenders reported internet addiction, child pornography as a substitute for contact offending or indiscriminate sexual interests. There was evidence to suggest that the recently arrested offenders were more sexually deviant, as they were more likely to have images of boys, larger collections, images depicting sexual violence or other paraphilic content and more involvement in online trading and communication.

The occurrence is of interest not alone because of the papers of the three learned contributors, but, still more, because of the indication it showed of how far neurologists have traveled from home during the past decade. The most interesting thing is that an association of American neurologists wanted, or even listened to such a symposium at all. As to the papers, all three captured the attention-one might say, captivated the 'group-mind' of the meeting.

Over the past 15-20 years, findings from the fields of neuroscience have attracted attention from leadership and management development scholars as we seek confirmation, deeper understandings, and new insights. This fascination has accelerated as management scholars enter into topics that have been studied in the past with neuroscience, such as mindfulness and perception. At the same time, traditional subjects in leadership and development research, such as decision making and empathy, have attracted the attention and curiosity of neuroscience researchers.

271,Improving the Preschooler's Science Knowledge and Skills through Hands-on Activities,"A practicum project designed a preschool science curriculum and requisite environment to improve students' enjoyment and interest in science. Based on teacher- and parent-questionnaire results, it was determined that student science attitudes were not positive; that students seldom had opportunities to explore, discover, and solve problems; and that the students' curiosity was inhibited by preconceived ideas about insects and rodents. Lack of parent participation and teachers' insecurity with teaching science concepts added to the problem. The solution strategy included developing science concepts as an integral part of each classroom learning center, using a multidisciplinary approach; planning extensive field trips; producing three plays; encouraging parent involvement; and organizing a science fair as part of a city-wide conference for parents, teachers, and the community. Evaluation results indicated that students can and do show an enthusiasm for science activities, that hands-on experiences do increase science vocabulary, that students willingly contribute to science activities, and that they can explain their science activities to others. Much of the success of the practicum was attributed to the outdoor experiences that students had at the park and on field trips to farms, nature centers, and museums.

272,Relationship between motivation for learning EFL and intrinsic motivation for learning in general among Japanese elementary school students,"This study investigated children's motivation for learning English as a foreign language (EFL) and intrinsic motivation for learning in general. The participants were 268 third-sixth graders in a public school in Japan. Data were collected using two questionnaires, one measuring motivation for learning EFL and the other investigating intrinsic motivation for studying in general. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) indicated that intrinsic motivation for studying in general as well as motivation for learning EFL of the participating students generally decline from third through sixth grades. The results of a multiple-regression analysis indicate that curiosity is a predictor of intrinsic motivation for learning EFL, interest in foreign countries, and instrumental motivation; enjoyment is a positive predictor of intrinsic motivation for learning EFL and interest in foreign countries; endogenous attribution is a negative predictor of instrumental motivation,; and internal causality is a positive predictor of instrumental motivation. It can be suggested that a developmental decline in intrinsic motivation for studying in general might influence English lessons. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

It includes fictional stories and quotations about teaching, reminiscences by former pupils about their teachers, etc. The title of the book is what caught my eye, since this is how I like to view the role teachers ought to play in people's lives.I truly believe that teachers constitute the cornerstone of any successful implementation of a program of study, on any level. Moreover, I think that beyond the mastery of the actual professional material they plan to teach, good teachers should also have deep and broad knowledge of the entire subject of which that material is part, and they must have the ability to convey the material to others correctly and reliably, to provide perspective, and to infuse the students with interest, curiosity, and enthusiasm. All this requires an educator to be more of an intellectual, at least in what concerns the relevant field at large.In the talk I'll try to elaborate on the teachers' role, and to discuss the principles that should underlie a good study program, while emphasizing high school computer science curricula. Thus, I will touch upon what I think should be the core issues for computer science education research. I will also share some anecdotes from my own life, which at the time motivated me to get involved in teaching and educating, in designing computer science study programs and in their implementation, and paved the way to my doing research on teaching the fundamentals of computer science.","Gal-Ezer, J",0,10.1145/1227310.1227312,203
274,Deterministic models for opinion formation through communication: A survey,"A fundamental question in modeling opinion dynamics is to know how can opinion be formed and evolved in a social network? This is an thorny subject which has attracted a hulk of attitudes and whetted the curiosity of researchers from various disciplines. One of the major points of view rests on the fact that opinion can be formed and revised through a process called social influence. This latter lies at the heart of the opinion modeling process and it has two types: Informational social influence, where a user forms his opinion according to information he obtained from a certain number of agents in his friendship and neighborhood. normative social influence is the second type of social influence and it lead to conformity. A very few empirical studies indicate that, it is also important to consider the normative influence in the opinion modeling process. In contrary, informational Influence is one of the main underlying premises used by many well-known theoretical models of opinion dynamics In the literature two main approaches have been adopted on how each individual updates her opinion: deterministic and probabilistic. Here, we focus only with deterministic models. We present various forms of modeling opinion dynamics in social networks and we show how opinions change following to social influence. Within the course of analysis, we point out both the strengths and weakness of many approaches. We aim to provide theoretical insight which may serve as guidelines for scientists, practitioners, researchers, consultants and developers who intend to design new methods in this area of interest. <c2><a9> 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Abid, O and Jamoussi, S and Ayed, Y B",0,10.1016/j.osnem.2018.02.002,204

280,Interest-taking and carry-over effects of incidental rejection emotions,"A study examined the role of interest-taking in regulating emotions and reducing the influence of incidental emotions when making judgments. To this end, 142 students participated in a single laboratory session. Participants were first led to believe that a peer had rejected them. They were then asked to write for seven minutes. The content of the writing depended on assignment to one of three conditions. In a suppression condition, they were asked to suppress their feelings and instead focus their attention to neutral events that had occurred earlier in the day. In a second expression condition participants were asked to express thoughts and feelings, but were given no more instructions on how to do so. A final interest-taking condition asked that participants not only express, but also take an interest or curiosity in their emotional experiences while doing so. Affect (specifically, anger, prosocial affect, and internalization of rejection) was measured immediately after the writing and at the end of the study. Additionally, participants rated audiotaped speeches in which the individual who rejected them, and an unrelated individual, engaged in moderate levels of self-disclosure. Results showed that self-reported interest differentiated the interested-expression condition from the other two; openness differentiated the two expression conditions from suppression, and private self-consciousness was similar in all conditions. Analyses predicting self-reported affect showed no effects of condition immediately following the writing procedure, although individuals in the interest condition showed lower implicit aggression immediately after writing. However, at the end of the study, interest-taking individuals reported less anger, more prosocial affect, and less internalization of rejection as compared to the other groups. Expressing participants reported similar affect to those who suppressed, except in the case of reporting higher prosocial affect. Results on judgment showed that individuals in all conditions judged the rejecting target similarly; but interested individuals were kinder to unrelated targets. This indicated that, for participants in the interest group, emotions were not carried over to the new target. Mediation analyses showed that expected rejection and implicit aggression were responsible for the effects of condition on judgment. Moderation analyses failed to show an effect with trait autonomy, although individuals who were insecurely attached benefited more from taking an interest. Implications for psychotherapy and more broadly for decision-making are discussed, and future directions are suggested.

281,"Anesthetize, smash, stop caring. The quiet work of destroying living meaning","It seems to make sense to restrict the term psychotic mechanisms to that part of the defence, which cuts off the connection to the inner and outer reality. From this one can separate another part, which secondarily serves to restore the relation to object and reality. Psychotic mechanisms are therefore characterised by the use of thoughts in the sense of archaic phantasies, misrepresenting the inner and the outer world: 1. as a defining hypothesis, 2. as fixation of this hypothesis, although there exists a knowledge, that this hypothesis is wrong, 3. for projective identification with its potential to induce enactment in the analyst and to equalize him with the actual archaic phantasies. Psychotic mechanisms therefore are active restrictions and alterations of ego-functions: consciousness, attention, memory, curiosity to get to know more precisely, and the ability to judge and differentiate between inside and outside, damaging and fostering. After this theoretical part which wants to give a definition of the term, a detailed clinical illustration follows in order to show, how the patient 1. projects the interest in analysis into the analyst, 2. significantly forgets the link between thoughts, 3. remembers insignificant parts of those links and 4. luxuriates in stupefaction, when oscillating between too much doubt and too much certainty. With the help of a detailed description of an analytical session the author shows, how the long lasting state of lifelessness, produced by the evacuation of meaning, gives way to a break-through of a direct and open aggressive attack. This is assessed to be a development, preceding the integration of that part of the personality, which was so long projected.

282,An action research on the scientist image of 4th grade students,"Many scientist image studies have been conducted with the participation of many students from various grades and from various age groups. In these studies, stereotyped images were determined and activities were designed to change the existing ones. However, there are still missing points in Turkey in terms of investigating the scientist image of the children at primary school age and changing this image through action study. Based on this point, the aim of the present study is to change the scientist image of the primary school children living in low socioeconomic conditions through telling scientific stories and direct reflecting activities. The study was conducted on 12 fourth grade students who were studying at a primary schools located in a village in Tokat in Turkey. In the context of the study, stories were read about the scientists who conducted studies in the field of science and social sciences and who achieved great success stories in their cultural environments and in international field, and activities based on direct reflection were conducted. The study was conducted throughout 9 weeks between September 2017- November 2017. At the end of the study process, it was observed that there were changes in the scientist images of the students; and it was concluded that the interests and curiosities of the students could be sustained with visits from scientists in the classrooms of the students together with supportive activities. <c2><a9> 2018 EdUHK APFSLT.","Alkis Kucukaydin, Mensure and Alki<c5><9f> K<c3><bc><c3><a7><c3><bc>kaydin, M",0,,208
283,Students' Reactions to the Use of Animals as Instructional Tools for Science,"Teaching science to students with special needs requires different approaches. A program at the study site supplemented packaged science kits with animal-assisted instruction, but such an approach was never evaluated. The purpose of this study was to provide a formative program evaluation documenting students' reactions to the use of animals as instructional tools for science. Conceptually this research project was framed in the constructivist paradigm based on the work of Dewey and Darling-Hammond. This evaluation involved a qualitative case-study approach to explore how 5th grade students with learning disabilities reacted toward science when animals were used to facilitate instruction. The research question was addressed based on the collection of data through focus group interviews, observations, and student journals. Data were analyzed as they emerged using inductive analysis in combination with typological analysis, to deconstruct the data into themes and patterns. Findings revealed students' reactions to the use of animals were positive, resulting from the engagement of students in the lesson activities and connections to the animals. Students' verbal and nonverbal engagements were noted, as well as feelings of curiosity, anxiety, and self-efficacy. The project for this study was an evaluation report for stakeholders that contained recommendations for enhancing science instruction with animals as instructional tools, acknowledging students' interests, and providing students with authentic, hands-on experiences. Implications for positive social change were that students with disabilities may be provided affirmation of their abilities to actively learn, experience, and understand science through the use of animals in such a way as to recognize their interests and develop their strengths.

284,"Competent Children at 10: Families, Early Education, and Schools","This report is the fourth from the Competent Children project that is following a sample of children in the Wellington region of New Zealand from their early education experience into adulthood. The main aim of the project is to chart the contributions to children's progress made by family resources, early childhood education, school experiences, children's interests and activities in the home or outside school, and peer relationships. This report describes the children's progress and lives at the age of 10 years in 10 areas of knowledge, skill, and dispositions: (1) literacy; (2) mathematics; (3) communication; (4) perseverance; (5) social skills with peers; (6) social skills with adults; (7) individual responsibility; (8) logical problem solving; (9) curiosity; and (10) fine motor skills. Among the main findings were that most children were comfortable in their school environment, were good at making and keeping friends, needed adult intervention to work with other children over a period of time, and had progressed in reading and problem solving. Children starting school with low competency were more likely to improve if their parents were highly educated or if their family had a high income, while high-achieving students maintained their achievement level. Other factors considered as possible contributions to children's performance were early childhood education experience, school experiences (school and class characteristics, teacher perspectives, school attitudes, communication with parents about school, school attendance and mobility), gender, having English as a first language, family resources/characteristics (family type and stability, income source, parental employment, ethnicity, family income, parent education), and children's interests and activities (academic-related, leisure). The report's conclusion notes that adult responsiveness to children, warmth, fairness, and the inclusion of some cognitive content in the interaction ensured supportive interactions between children and the adults in their lives. The report's five appendices include descriptions of data analysis and results as well as a discussion of the selection of a statistical model for the study. (Contains 51 references.)

285,"""Is it really worth it to get tested?"": Primary care patients' impressions of predictive SNP testing for colon cancer","Despite significant progress in genomics research over the past decade, we remain years away from the integration of genomics into routine clinical care. As an initial step toward the implementation of genomic-based medicine, we explored primary care patients' ideas about genomic testing for common complex diseases to help develop future patient education materials and interventions to communicate genomic risk information. We conducted a mixed-methods study with participants from a large primary care clinic. Within four focus groups, we used a semi-structured discussion guide and administered brief pre- and post- discussion quantitative surveys to assess participants' interest, attitudes, and preferences related to testing and receipt of test results. Prior to the discussion, moderators presented a plain-language explanation of DNA and genetics, defined ""SNP"", and highlighted what is known and unknown about the risks associated with testing for SNPs related to colorectal cancer risk. We used the NVIVO 8 software package to analyze the transcripts from the focus group discussions. The majority of participants (75 %) were ""very"" or ""somewhat interested"" in receiving information from a colon cancer SNP test, even after learning about and discussing the small and still clinically uncertain change in risk conferred by SNPs. Reported interest in testing was related to degree of risk conferred, personal risk factors, family history, possible implications for managing health /disease prevention and curiosity about genetic results. Most people (85 %) preferred that genetic information be delivered in person by a healthcare or genetics professional rather than through print materials or a computer. These findings suggest that patients may look to genetic counselors, physicians or other healthcare professionals as gatekeepers of predictive genomic risk information.

290,"The ""orient"" in Florence (19th Century). from Oriental Studies to the Collection of Islamic Art, from a Reconstruction of the ""orient"" to the Exotic Dream of the Rising Middle Class","The second half of the 19th Century was in Florence a period of extraordinary and fruitful interest in the oriental world when the philological and oriental studies were promoted. Thanks to the fervour of these studies, in 1878 Florence was designated to host the 4th Congress of the Orientalists. The ""Orient"" excited curiosity and collecting passion to such an extent that we could argue that the legacy of the magnificent Medicean collecting was inherited by the private middle-classes. Moreover, the new cultural context contributed to transforming the taste, it gave rise to new styles in architecture as well as in decoration and generally in the applied arts. After examining these topics, we will focus our attention on a little known fact that we could describe as the rebuilt ""Orient"" for entertainment, that is to say the Florentine Carnival in 1886, an event of the ""disquieting"" exoticism by which Europe represented the Islamic world. <c2><a9> 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Stasolla, M G",0,10.1163/22138617-12340002,214
291,Why People Use Chatbots,"There is a growing interest in chatbots, which are machine agents serving as natural language user interfaces for data and service providers. However, no studies have empirically investigated people's motivations for using chatbots. In this study, an online questionnaire asked chatbot users (N = 146, aged 16-55 years) from the US to report their reasons for using chatbots. The study identifies key motivational factors driving chatbot use. The most frequently reported motivational factor is ``productivity''; chatbots help users to obtain timely and efficient assistance or information. Chatbot users also reported motivations pertaining to entertainment, social and relational factors, and curiosity about what they view as a novel phenomenon. The findings are discussed in terms of the uses and gratifications theory, and they provide insight into why people choose to interact with automated agents online. The findings can help developers facilitate better human-chatbot interaction experiences in the future. Possible design guidelines are suggested, reflecting different chatbot user motivations.","Brandtzaeg, Petter Bae and Folstad, Asbjorn",0,10.1007/978-3-319-70284-1_30,215
292,Teaching German with TPRS (Total Physical Response Storytelling),"Total Physical Response Storytelling (TPRS) has enjoyed a tremendous increase of interest in recent years because so many teachers in high schools and colleges are finding that it reinvigorates their German programs. Some even claim that it has saved them. TPRS actually consists of two complementary pedagogical methods: (1) Total Physical Response and (2) Storytelling. Total Physical Response was developed in the 1960s and '70s by James Asher, a professor of psychology at San Jose State University, California, while Storytelling was created in the 1980s and '90s by Blaine Ray, a language teacher from Bakersfield, California. Ray used storytelling to supplement TPR and carry it into more advanced stages of language learning. The author hopes to contribute both to a better understanding of the method and to foster its wider use in German classes since there is so much promise and initial curiosity about TPRS.

293,THE MASTER IN PHYSICS STUDENT PROFILE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BUCHAREST,"There is a paradox: the people are interested in Science especially at the huge natural catastrophes (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunami waves, nuclear accidents). Other problems are related to the fact that the young people chose mainly carriers outside the scientific fields. Therefore, it is interesting to analyze the profile of the student at the Sciences faculties, in particular, at the faculties of Physics. In this work we present the profile of the student at the second Bologna cycle', master studies, at the Faculty of Physics from the University of Bucharest, Romania. In agreement with the Bologna system, master studies have two academic years duration, and they are in deep connection with the seven specializations at the Doctoral School in Physics. It is important to stress that the Doctoral School in Physics has a special direction for Education in Physics. Who is the master student at the faculty of Physics? First of all he/she is a graduate of one of the faculties of Physics from Romania or abroad, interested in a good education in selected field, as well a performing institution, recognize at the national and international level. A few of them are graduates of the Applied Sciences, Electronics and Computers, Material Sciences, Space Sciences etc from the technical universities, as Mathematics and Informatics, Chemistry, Geography, Geology and Biology from the ``classical'' universities. Some time, graduates from ``exotic fields'' like Law, Economics and Administration, Theology, etc. Why they selected master studies in Physics? Almost 70% from these mentioned passion for Science and/or scientific interests. 15%, mainly those coming from other field mentioned the requests of the labor market. Others mentioned the enlargement of the knowledge areas, scientific curiosity and academic interest. The ages of the applicants are, in a large majority, between 22 and 30 years, only a few having over 30 years. Initial tests - at the beginning of the first academic year, as well as a final test - at the end of the second academic year prove the performance. Such studies can help in the evaluation of the attractive degree of the master study programs and in the enlargement of the basis of specialists in different fields.","Covlea, V and Calin, M and Jipa, A and Butoi, B and Bita, B and Berlic, C and Barna, E",0,,217
294,Learner Acceptance of a Multimedia-Based Learning System,"The present study applied the technology acceptance model to examine the determinants leading to learners' behavioral intention to use a multimedia-based learning system. Four exogenous constructsmultimedia self-efficacy, perceived richness of multimedia presentation, perceived learner control, and perceived system responsivenesswere externally added to the framework to improve its predictive power for the specific behavioral context. In addition, the second-order construct of cognitive engagement was created based upon the dimensions of curiosity, attention focus, and interest and was subsequently incorporated into the framework. The hypothesized conceptual framework was validated using sample data collected from 286 respondents who completed an online survey instrument. Results from structural equation analysis revealed that (a) behavioral intention was jointly determined by attitude and perceived usefulness; (b) attitude was jointly determined by perceived usefulness and cognitive engagement; (c) multimedia self-efficacy, perceived richness of multimedia presentation, and cognitive engagement were immediate antecedents to perceived usefulness; and (d) cognitive engagement was a key intervening variable linking the four exogenous constructs with perceived usefulness.","Lee, Doo Young and Ryu, Hokyoung",0,10.1080/10447318.2012.715278,218
295,Teaching Chemistry with Civic Engagement: Non-Science Majors Enjoy Chemistry When They Learn by Doing Research that Provides Benefits to the Local Community,"This chapter describes a chemistry instructor's evolution in the use of five different teaching methods in an effort to improve student motivation, engagement, and learning in chemistry courses designed for non-majors: 1) integrating ``big questions'' about timely topics as the driving focus for learning the fundamental concepts of chemistry; 2) following how human curiosity about common phenomena of nature drove the history of chemistry, science and medicine; 3) allowing students to select their own topics of interest and requiring them to write reports about those by analyzing and synthesizing evidence from science and medical research reports observing rigorous criteria for evaluating the quality and validity of evidence; 4) conducting hands-on experimentation; and finally, 5) embedding learning in a research project that students conduct to provide real benefits to the local community. Of these methods, the last produced the most improvement in student attitudes, interest in science, commitment of effort to the learning process, and ability to articulate their understanding of science concepts. This was true in a general education course for first-year non-science majors who were in the course primarily because it was required. Results include instructor assessment of student motivation, engagement, and learning. But the most powerful data are the students' words written in reflections about how they perceived their experience in the course, and what they found most worthwhile about it. Virtually every student in the course over a period of seven semesters and five years indicated they enjoyed the course and found it worthwhile. Nearly everyone reported that what they found most worthwhile about the course was the opportunity to learn while doing something that benefited others in our area. Finding that student motivation, effort invested in learning, and success in learning was best achieved when students were learning by doing research that benefited the community, and that students consistently appreciated the opportunity to learn by doing something that provided benefit to others, suggests that civic engagement may be a powerful way to achieve a markedly higher level of the outcomes that we all desire for our students, especially for those students who do not already have an inherent interest in chemistry and science.","Midden, W Robert",0,,219
296,Trust in social dilemmas,"Social dilemmas pose a key challenge to human society. Conflicts between self-interest and collective interests are inherently complex. Global warming and depletion of natural resources, such as rainforest, fish, or threatened species all share important social dilemma features. Likewise, how can we make most or all people feel committed to contribute to important public goods, such as going beyond the call of duty at the workplace to realize important goals or simply paying tickets when enjoying public transportation. Besides their obvious societal relevance, social dilemma constitute an important scientific topic as it relates to the study of human cooperation. Social dilemmas bring to the forefront motives such as selfishness, egalitarianism, and retaliation or emotions such as empathy, guilt, or shame. It is a ""rich"" situation that has, predictably, drawn the scientific curiosity of many scientists worrying in various disciplines, such as anthropology, biology, economics, management science, political science, psychology, and sociology.

297,"Eastern mathematics, western mathematics: Shall the twain ever meet?","A popular view among historians of mathematics is: mathematics outside the sphere of Greek influence, such as Indian or Chinese mathematical traditions, was algebraic in inclination and empirical in practice, a marked contrast to Greek mathematics which was geometric and anti-empirical. The beginnings of Greek mathematics are often traced to the founding of the Pythagorean School with its peculiar mixture of mysticism and scientific curiosity. In experiments with strings of different lengths, the Pythagoreans arrived at a definition of musical notes in terms of the ratios of these strings. The chapter summarizes the distinctive feature of Greek mathematics which explains both its strengths and limitations. Throughout the history of China, the practical art of calculation played a central role in the process of conceptualization in mathematics. Interest in calculation was matched by the invention of a positional number system which lent itself easily to calculation. <c2><a9> 2015 Jobin M.

Teachers are provided with material on each topic of discussion and are introduced to references that will help satisfy their own curiosity. The first chapter refers to some studies in split-brain research that show how our brains are organized for problem solving and demonstrates how drawing skills can be used to tap creative resources. The remaining chapters provide opportunities for students and teachers to explore four large areas of natural history: size, scale, and the world of the very small; predator-prey relationships among animals; animal communication; and the ecology of living communities, including their human members.

301,Curiosity and spontaneous alternation,"A review of literature indicated that either reactive inhibition or curiosity may explain the phenomenon of spontaneous alternation. A set of experiments was conducted to identify the relationship between these two drives. Six experimentally naive rhesus monkeys were used for this study. In one exepriment, if the monkeys pushed against and opened the door of a modified WGTA, they were permitted 10sec to look into the surroundings of a pink board settled behind the door. The E initiated each experimental period of 15min a day by raising the opaque screen and exposing the doors to the animals. Number of trials of looking into-behavior was recorded. In another experiment, after all the animals became not to show the curiosity of looking-into, a food reward, instead of a visual exploration incentive, was used for the test of spontaneous alternation in the same apparatus so arranged that only reactive inhibition did work. The six animals were given fifty-one trials a day for nine days. The results were: 1. Curiosity in the rhesus monkeys disappeared in a relatively short term (Table 3), but it recovered in about 23 hours. Curiosity was maintained for about eight days (Table 1). Marked individual differences of curiosity were found in the monkeys (Table 2). 2. The percentage of spontaneous alternation appeared relatively low in monkeys (Fig. 1). No statistically significant differences were obtained both between the nine days and between the five sessions of ten trials each. Individual differences in alternation were found (Table 5). 3. Of greatest interest, however, was a significant positive correlation coefficientt between spontaneous alternation and curiosity. In addition, a factor analysis by the T technique showed that two typical factors were responsible for both of the two behaviors, although their loadings and variances were different from each other (Table 6). One factor was concave in the configuration of the loadings for the nine days, and another was convex (Fig. 2). The former was interpreted as the adaptation-to-situation factor, the latter as the investigation/or curiosity factor. No single factor represented by the concept of inhibition was found. Inhibition was supposed to affect the two factor loadings. It was also suggested that inhibition would increase as a result of the repetition of the investigatory reflex. <c2><a9> 1964, The Japanese Psychological Association.

302,Evaluation for the allocation of university research project funding: Can rules improve the peer review?,"Evaluation for the allocation of project-funding schemes devoted to sustain academic research often undergoes changes of the rules for the ex-ante selection, which are supposed to improve the capability of peer review to select the best proposals. How modifications of the rules realize a more accountable evaluation result? Do the changes suggest an improved alignment with the program's intended objectives? The article addresses these questions investigating Research Project of National Interest, an Italian collaborative project-funding scheme for academic curiosity-driven research through a case study design that provides a description of how the changes of the ex-ante evaluation process were implemented in practice. The results show that when government tries to steer the peer-review process by imposing an increasing number of rules to structure the debate among peers and make it more accountable, the peer-review practices remain largely impervious to the change. <c2><a9> The Author 2017.

306,Assessing affective and conative factors in reading,"The experience of reading problems by students in content area classrooms is often a reflection of low interest. To the extent that teachers can inspire a commitment or emotional stake in students toward text materials, they increase the likelihood that students will succeed in reading to learn. The author discusses assessment ideas related to the affective domain and conative factors that can help teachers ignite student interest and motivation.

307,TRADITIONAL MUSIC IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS: GOOD PRACTICES OF A CULTURALLY,"In this paper we present the case of a teacher of a public High School Music sited in a village near Valencia city who, by means of traditional music and instruments, not only proposes that the awareness of musical heritage is a necessary cultural activity but also he uses this heritage as the axis to build his methodology in order to teach a basic musical language. The career of this teacher goes from a musical training as a wind player - he was an amateur musician in a local band - up to his training as a graduated educator due to his teaching vocation, at the same time that he was part of a pop - rock group as a self-taught guitarist during his training process. Initially he worked for some years in an adult school, however labor conditions were not good so he prepared and approved the public examinations for the High School in the specialty of music. It was then when he decided to deep into his musical training by studying piano during two years and also harmony and percussion. Teaching in secondary changed his conception of musical education as it required further formation to obtain a wealth of experiences and resources to motivate his teenager students. His musical curiosity made him to explore and to investigate different traditional music, an educational resource taken from the inherited sense of our ancestors who transmitted old traditions and their knowledge in a ludic way while respecting their customs. Hence his interest in bringing the traditional music to his classroom, as it is a good example of interculturality which gathers all the knowledge that has passed through our land. However he works not only with the ``Valencian'' folklore but also with other Spanish traditional songs and even with music from European and non-European countries because he affirms that music is a cultural fusion and cannot be understood in a pure state. In this paper we present the data obtained through a qualitative research, specifically a deep case study about how a teacher implemented the music curriculum in the High School classrooms by an ethnographic observation, in-depth interviews and the analysis of documentary evidence, made with the support of the Vice President of ``Research and Science Politic'' of the University of Valencia, in order to point out the good practices of the High School music teachers who develop working paths which are recognized by the community of teachers as the best practices that must be documented and implemented as models in various areas of the High School Master in the Art of Music.","Hurtado, Julio and Perez, Manuel",0,,229
308,New Directions for High School Career and Technical Education in Wyoming: A Strategic Plan,"This report offers a plan for improving career and technical education (CTE) in Wyoming, but it is about more than just technical education. Realizing the potential of CTE to contribute to students' mastery of both academic and technical knowledge depends not only on strengthening the CTE curriculum, but also on embedding CTE in a larger program combining core academics with applied learning. It is a plan focused on preparing students for postsecondary education ""and"" career, both options and not just one or the other. This plan calls for breaking down the rigid separation between academic and technical instruction in high school to capitalize on students' curiosity about the workings of the modern world. And it builds on this interest to deepen their understanding of core concepts in mathematics, science, English, and social studies. This report is organized into four major chapters. Chapter 1 examines the current state of CTE in Wyoming. Recent court-ordered changes to the delivery system have provided a solid footing on which to build challenging new options for high school students, and this section briefly summarizes student participation in the system, existing state standards and assessments, program financing, and other features of the current system. Chapter 2 briefly summarizes what a system of integrated academics and CTE might look like in Wyoming, and lays out the guiding principles and core components of the pathways model. Chapter 3 outlines and analyzes the essential policy considerations for strengthening CTE in high schools and embedding it in comprehensive programs of academic and technical study. It addresses such issues as the need for more fully developed programs of study, content standards and assessment, curriculum design and integration, support of innovative delivery systems, teacher preparation and professional development, articulation with postsecondary education, and implications for school finance, including adequate funding for vocational supplies, equipment, and capital outlay. Chapter 4 offers some concluding observations and suggested next steps to guide state policymakers and educators in implementing plan recommendations. Appended are: (1) Interviews Completed; (2) Site Visits Conducted; and (3) Bibliography.

310,DESIGN OF AN E-LEARNING PLATFORM BASED ON THE SEMANTIC WEB AND THE,"This search paper comes after a critical and analytical study of a group of research and articles that put an interest on E-Learning, which most of them are focused on computerization and management of educational content at the expense of the educational process. Thus, each system based on this principle gives learners fixed contents and predefined learning paths which do not agree with the requirements of most users. For this reason, we have proposed directing our research towards the design model for E-Learning that learners can have access to, especially to educational services responsive to their needs and keep pace with their scientific curiosity. This model also keeps pace with their rhythms to learn and satisfy to their private desires. From this standpoint, we adopted the pedagogy of objectives as a frame of reference for a technological approach. This last took the semantic web, the ontological engineering and the multi-agents systems as a basis to provide our e-learning system reasoning capabilities, which enable it to offer appropriate pedagogical services and create personalized paths betting on the quality of performance and the generation of new rhythms of learning by taking into account the profile of the learner (level of knowledge, preferences, competences, centers of interest, style of learning, etc.).","Ghailani, Mohamed and El Bouhdidi, Jaber and Fennan, Abdelhadi",0,,232
311,How safe are service robots in urban environments? Bullying a Robot,"This paper describes and discusses the preliminary results of a behavioural study on robot social acceptability, which was carried out during a public demonstration in South Korea. Data was collected by means of direct observation of people behaviour during interaction with robots. The most interesting result to emerge is that of young people: they tended to react to the robots presence with extreme curiosity and, quite often, to treat them aggressively. In this paper, the word bullying is used to describe any kind of improper and violent behaviour, intended to cause damages or impede the robot operation. It is the authors' opinion that if not tackled appropriately, abuses towards robots may become a serious hindrance to their future deployment, and safety. Hence, the necessity to tackle this issue with dedicated solutions during the early phases of design.","Salvini, P and Ciaravella, G and Yu, W and Ferri, G and Manzi A. and and Mazzolai, B and Laschi, C and Oh, S R and Dario, P",0,,233
313,Enquiry-based science in the infant classroom: â€˜letting goâ€™,"ABSTRACT: Enquiry-based science in primary classrooms is key to encouraging children's interest and curiosity about the world around them and as a result helps to stimulate their understanding and enjoyment of science. Yet many primary teachers lack the confidence to implement enquiry-based approaches effectively. The reasons are myriad and often result in the teacher controlling and orchestrating the lesson leaving little room for children's exploration and autonomy. This paper explores how one infant school teacher was willing to relinquish control and <e2><80><98>let go<e2><80><99> and expand her pedagogical repertoire to manage the many obstacles to including enquiry-based science in her classroom. The autonomy the children were given resulted in genuine enquiry-based science with the consequential benefit to their learning. Furthermore the teacher's confidence and self-efficacy seem to have been raised ensuring that that she would continue to include enquiry-based science as part of her practice in the future. As a model for other primary teachers this approach could help them overcome their reticence to engage with enquiry-based science. <c2><a9> 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Byrne, J and Rietdijk, W and Cheek, S",0,10.1080/09669760.2015.1135105,234
318,Following Giacometti: Copying as a Basis for Studio-Based Research,"The debate over copying in the art classroom is a longstanding and contentious one. In the past, the discussion has been erroneously characterized as a two-sided argument between those who view copying as the vilest of crimes to be perpetrated in an art classroom and those who see in it a useful and even essential tool for learning. In the last decade, a new emphasis has been placed in academic circles, and especially within art education, on the potential for studio practice as a site for the creation of knowledge. The research presented in this paper stems from work done in an artist's studio. This research is part of a larger ongoing project that stems from the author's personal interest in the Swiss sculptor and painter Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966). Some time ago, his curiosity concerning Giacometti's working methods led him to several initial creative experiments which in turn have led him to thinking about questions concerning how artistic research in general and research into artists in particular is approached. Focussing principally on Giacometti's paintings, the author explores the practical question of how Giacometti worked in his studio through a physical recreation using practical working methods rather than from a purely conceptual basis.

319,Why Do Children Learn the Words They Do?,"Most children can produce a few words by the end of their first year and rapidly acquire almost 30 times as many words in the following year. Although this general pattern remains the same for children learning different languages, the words individual children know are considerably different. In this article, we consider the possibility that children are an important source of variability in early vocabulary acquisition in the context of curiosity-driven approaches to language learning. In particular, we review research that supports two interrelated claims: that what children know and what children are interested in interact in shaping what children learn. We suggest that this, as well as the possibility that children are motivated intrinsically to learn language, sets the stage for early vocabulary learning.","Mani, Nivedita and Ackermann, Lena",0,10.1111/cdep.12295,236

322,Review of Navigating art therapy: A theraist's companion,"Reviews the book, Navigating Art Therapy: A Theraist's Companion compiled by Chris Wood (see record 2011-00248-000). Navigation is an apt metaphor employed by British art therapist Chris Wood in Navigating Art Therapy: A Therapist's Companion. Wood offers us an art therapy reference book that is filled with a vast array of information and cross-referencing, which ""help with navigation through the ideas, although this is not always in a straight line"". From the beginning, Wood is clear that her passion for dictionaries and anthologies informed the creation and structure of this book. With 73 contributors are seasoned art therapists mostly from Great Britain), Wood is to be acknowledged for successfully undertaking an enormous organizational task. The reference book format accomplishes that which Wood finds most helpful about dictionaries and anthologies: the indirect exploration of ""associated ideas"". As an art therapist, I found Wood's book to be refreshing and entertaining to peruse. It is neither pedantic nor tedious as some reference books can be and there are many unfamiliar topics to explore. Finally, it is possible that Navigating Art Therapy: A Therapist's Companion will hold particular interest to persons outside the profession who have a fascination for ideas, a love of the arts, and curiosity about the human condition, as they traverse into the world of art therapy.

323,NATURE STUDIES AND TECHNOLOGIES COMPETENCE AND CRITERIA OF ITS,"Today increasingly greater attention is being paid to the development of nature studies and technologies. It is in the subjects of nature studies that pupils learn to observe nature and natural phenomena objectively, analyse and understand them, make assumptions and experiment, and draw conclusions. Nature studies give pupils everything needed to form and gradually broaden their understanding of the surrounding world. It facilitates pupil curiosity and critical views; they reflect on the link between human beings and nature. The qualitative process of learning nature studies at school enables pupils to acquire basic knowledge and skills in the field of science and develop nature studies and technologies competences, facilitating pupils' transformation into technically proficient representatives of society and encouraging them to further advance in the field of nature studies and technologies. School should create interest in nature studies and facilitate acquisition of knowledge with the understanding that there should be applied pedagogical approaches enabling transition from memorization of scientific facts to construction of knowledge in ways understandable and meaningful to pupils. One of the opportunities is to involve pupils in the exploration of problems of natural sciences in real-life contexts in the learning process. This means that the development of nature studies and technologies competences should be facilitated in the context-oriented learning process. In Latvia, issues on the understanding of the concept of context and implementation of context oriented learning in physics in the field of nature studies didactics are not sufficiently studied. Therefore, the research reflected in this article includes analysis of scientific literature on the essence of nature studies and technologies competences and criteria for evaluating these competences. Analytical judgments are based on prior theoretical and empirical research, as well as on our personal pedagogical experiences.","Poplavskis, Janis and Dzerviniks, Janis",0,,240

326,"Emerging health order, values and the law: Conflicts and resolution","The realm of contemporary healthcare is pluralistic and complex. It is a blend of scientific promise, moral values, socio-economic constrains, cultural sensitivities, religious beliefs, political imperatives and commercial interests. Institutionalization of health care, with growing governmental control and the desire towards resource optimization, has widened the rift between individual and community perspectives. The quest for longer life-span, the urge to have 'perfect' babies, the curiosity to know our past and future, and many more expectations, have added new dimensions to human health and healthcare. In several areas ethical concepts are not clear and, at times, right and wrong contemplate redefinition posing serious challenge to the cultivators of law. The issue of biotechnological achievements and their social assimilation contemplates a much deeper dialogue than what is being done in contemporary ethical discussions.

331,The Murky Distinction Between Curiosity and Interest: State of the Art and Future Prospects,"Curiosity and interest are at the core of human inquiry. However, controversies remain about how best to conceptualize these constructs. I propose to derive definitions by attending to the common core of typical usages of the two terms. Using this approach, curiosity can be defined as a psychological state that includes three components: recognition of an information gap, anticipation that it may be possible to close it, and an intrinsically motivated desire to do so. Interest can be more broadly defined as intrinsically motivated engagement with any specific object, content, or activity. The two definitions imply that curiosity is a special case of interest. Furthermore, I propose to use the state-trait distinction to distinguish between momentary and enduring forms of both curiosity and interest, which makes it possible to treat state versus trait curiosity and interest in conceptually parallel ways. To make further progress in understanding the two constructs, research is needed that investigates their affective dynamics and their generalizability across age-related and socio-cultural contexts.","Pekrun, Reinhard",0,10.1007/s10648-019-09512-1,246
332,Bridging the Gap between the Science Curriculum and Students' Questions: Comparing Linear vs. Hypermedia Online Learning Environments,"While interest is central to learning, considerable disparities have been reported between students' science interests and the science curriculum. This study explores how 5th grade students' (n = 72) competence, relatedness and interest levels changed as a consequence of using two online learning environments, which bridged the students' anonymous curiosity questions and the required science curriculum on the topic of ""Natural Resources."" One environment provided answers to the students' questions (a ""linear"" environment), whereas the other provided relevant links and sent the students to find the answer by themselves (a ""hypermedia"" environment). Each student experienced both of the environments, and their competence, relatedness and interest levels were examined using a closed pre/posttest questionnaire. Interest level increased only after experiencing learning with the linear environment, whereas competence level increased only after using the hypermedia environment. These findings point to the potential of using online learning environments to narrow the gap between the curriculum and students' interests, while emphasizing the pedagogical need for diverse online environments for different learners and learning goals.","Swirski, Hani and Baram-Tsabari, Ayelet",0,,247

334,A Selective Meta-Analysis on the Relative Incidence of Discrete Affective States During Learning With Technology,"The last decade has witnessed considerable interest in the investigation of the affective dimensions of learning and in the development of advanced learning technologies that automatically detect and respond to student affect. Identifying the affective states that students experience in technology-enhanced learning contexts is a fundamental question in this area. This article provides an initial attempt to answer this question with a selective meta-analysis of 24 studies that utilized a mixture of methodologies (online self-reports, online observations, emote-aloud protocols, cued recall) and affect judges (students themselves, untrained peers, trained judges) for fine-grained monitoring of 14 discrete affective states of 1,740 middle school, high school, college, and adult students in 5 countries. Affective states occurred over the course of interactions with a range of learning technologies, including intelligent tutoring systems, serious games, simulation environments, and simple computer interfaces. Standardized effect sizes of relative frequency, computed by comparing the proportional occurrence of each affective state to the other states in each study, were modeled with random-effects models. Engagement/flow was consistently found to be relatively frequent (d(+) = 2.5), and contempt, anger, disgust, sadness, anxiety, delight, fear, and surprise were consistently infrequent, with d(+) ranging from -6.5 to -0.78. Effects for boredom (d(+) = 0.19), confusion (d(+) = 0.12), curiosity (d(+) = -0.10), happiness (d(+) = -0.13), and frustration (d(+) = -2.5) varied substantially across studies. Mixed-effects models indicated that the source of the affect judgments (self vs. observers) and the authenticity of the learning contexts (classroom vs. laboratory) accounted for greater heterogeneity than the use of advanced learning technologies and training time. Theoretical and applied implications of the findings are discussed.","D'Mello, Sidney",0,10.1037/a0032674,249
335,Bringing Marketing Research to Life via Secret Shopping,"A key challenge in marketing courses is to stimulate student curiosity and interest in marketing research. Depending on how the material is presented, student perceptions are often favorably or unfavorably polarized on this subject. That is, research can be perceived as either intriguing and intellectually stimulating or uninteresting and uninspiring. Understanding and appreciating marketing research is an essential part of learning about consumer behavior, service quality, market segmentation, targeting, and positioning, marketing strategy, and other important marketing concepts. Many of today's marketing managers appreciate the inherent value of quality research in making better decisions. Students also need to understand the critical role that marketing research plays in the decision-making process. To help students gain a greater understanding and appreciation of marketing research methods, the author has effectively utilized students as secret shoppers in numerous client-based, class projects. This observational research method is a great way to involve students in the subject matter. It also ensures a high level of student participation throughout the course. An online survey was conducted among 102 students who participated in secret shopping research in two different marketing courses. Key results reveal that the secret shopping method increased students' interest in marketing research. The students found the research to be fun and relatively easy to conduct. Most importantly, using this observational research technique increased students' understanding of marketing research.","Geissler, Gary L",0,,250

Central in that when present, purpose is a predominant theme of a person's identity. Self-organizing in that it provides a framework for systematic behavior patterns in everyday life. As a life aim, a purpose generates continual goals and targets for efforts to be devoted. A purpose provides a bedrock foundation that allows a person to be more resilient to obstacles, stress, and strain. In this paper, we outline a theoretical model of purpose development. Besides outlining various essential ingredients to creating a purpose in life, we describe three broad pathways. The first process is proactive involving effort over time and only resulting in a purpose after gradual refinement and clarification. The second process is reactive involving a transformative life event where a purpose arises and adds clarity to the person's life. The third process is social learning - involving the formation of purpose through observation, imitation, and modeling. Our aim is to stimulate more research on this higher-level construct in the architecture of personality.","Kashdan, T B and McKnight, P E",0,,253

344,From Magic Show to Meaningful Science,"As science teachers, they understand the importance of gaining student interest to promote learning. They know how challenging it is to spark the curiosity to truly engage students in the processes of ""doing science."" One often-used method of motivation is the demonstration of science in action. Demonstrations such as ""discrepant events"". They are ""discrepant"" because something occurs that is unexpected. A discrepancy causes students to wonder ""How did ""that"" happen?"" and to want those questions answered. Although discrepant events are one way of bringing students to this place of ""wanting to know"", the drawback of using them occurs when they are not taken beyond the ""magic show"" to meaningful inquiry and the scientific principles behind the event. The guided inquiry model of instruction enriches science learning and capitalizes on the questions generated by discrepant event demonstrations. With a guided inquiry approach students are taken through one step at a time in a series of tasks and feedback sessions. The Mysterious Multiplying Water Bottle lesson models a guided inquiry approach adapted from Suchman's ""Inquiry Training Model"" (1992). This model assists students in asking questions that move from observation to the development of predictions. Most often students in classrooms are expected to ""answer"" the questions, not to ""ask"" them. Yet, asking questions is what propels learning.

345,Wanting and Liking: Components of Situated Motivation Constructs?,"Brain studies have revealed that 2 neurological systems, one for ``wanting'' and one for ``liking,'' are responsible for many instances of motivated behavior. If wanting and liking are fundamental elements of motivation, then we should also expect to see them represented in educational models of motivation for learning. However, it has not yet been established whether this is the case. Situated instances of motivation, such as when a student feels motivated to immediately engage in learning, can potentially be informed by education constructs such as curiosity, situational interest, intrinsic motivation, achievement emotions, and flow. The purpose of this article is to investigate whether the two elements, wanting and liking, can be identified in each of these constructs. The analysis revealed that the education constructs could be inferred to include wanting and liking. It is proposed that a focus on these fundamental elements might aid our understanding of motivation in educational settings.","Palmer, David",0,10.1111/mbe.12141,257

Literature points out that scientific education must start at pre-school in order to empower students' full citizenship. In fact, the development of scientific literacy (SL) should be undertaken in various dimensions and independently of the contexts were students live and are raised. The Guarda District is characterised by a high degree isolated schools, where students face a general feeble educational stimulation and, particularly, in SC a rather low input. We need to develop educational projects based on inclusion for promoting equality regarding students' access to scientific culture. Our previous study (Reis, 2010) shows that pre and primary teachers (PPT) present a positive perception about the existence of an overall inclusive culture, which is essential for personal, professional and social sucess. The purpose of this research is to analyse Guarda Disctric PPT attitudes and practices, concerning science teaching. Research Methods: We analyzed PPT' perceptions, regarding two dimensions: a) SL b) science attitudes and practices (SAP). To analysed SL we used an adjustment of Eurobarometer 340. For SAP we adapted the Protocol's Attitudes towards Science. In the SL instrument we collected the most and less valuable questions and the most and less important aspects referred. For the SAP instrument we collected the most and less valuable questions regarding general attitudes and practices. PPT inputs were, then, summed up, averaged and gathered in five categories (themes of interest, information from media, involvement with S&T degree of agreement with scientists and with science) for the first instrument and in two categories for the second one (general attitudes and practices). Findings and Conclusions: Concerning the SL: the most and the less valuable themes of interest were ambiental questions (81%) and political news (4%); 89% agree that science should be allowed to use animals in experiments and 15% considers that S&T can solve any problems. Concerning the SAP: about general attitudes, 90% agrees that curiosity is essential in science; about practices, 95% indicates search for information as a most used aspect and 60% indicates Magalhaes (R) computer (computer introduced for primary students 5 years ago) as a less used aspect. This study shows that there is a gap between what PPT think and what PPT do at school regarding S&T. The need to develop and improve SAP in Guarda District schools is fundamental to get better prepared students to face the complexities of our times society. PPT have the means but, mostly, they are not being assertive in doing what they believe. This project will continue with the development of a set of science activities in the context of the classroom that seek to increase assertiveness of teachers in science teaching.

347,A Preliminary Model of Motivation for Pornography Consumption Among Men Participating in Zoophilic Virtual Environments,"Although zoophilic blogs and websites attract the attention of zoophiles and others who are curious about this sexual activity, the motivations for consuming this type of pornography are not clear. This study aimed to confirm the factorial validity of the Pornography Consumption Inventory in an online sample of men with sexual interest in animals, and to construct an association model between motivations for pornography consumption and the following psychological variables: depression, sexual impulsiveness, and strength of sexual interest in animals. In this cross-sectional study, we located a website that catered to a network of people with a sexual interest in animals. Subsequently, a questionnaire was made available online to members of this network. Results support the 4-factor model of the Pornography Consumption Inventory. Depression and strength of sexual interest in animals were negatively and positively correlated with the sexual curiosity factor, respectively. Sexual impulsiveness was positively associated with the emotional avoidance, excitement seeking, and sexual pleasure factors. Depression and sexual impulsiveness were positively correlated. Psychological factors can differently motivate the consumption of pornography among men who visit zoophilic blogs and websites. With these preliminary data, we can identify some characteristics of this population.","de Souza Aranha e Silva, Renata Almeida and Baltieri, Danilo Antonio",0,10.1080/0092623X.2014.996930,259
348,From control to ownership: China's managerial revolution,"Over the past decade, the ownership and control of China's corporate sector has finally begun to depart fundamentally from patterns typical in the socialist past. Students of corporate governance have watched these changes with an intense curiosity about their impact on firm performance. Students of comparative economic institutions have examined them for hints of a new variety of Asian capitalism and have sought to anticipate China's international competitiveness and impact. But these changes potentially will create a new corporate elite with greater compensation, personal wealth, and independence from government agencies than ever before. This transformation of China's political economy may eventually alter the Chinese state itself, although the extent and nature of this change are still far from clear. The key questions of interest are the social origins of the new elite, the scale of the economic assets they control, and especially their continuing relationships with party and government agencies. The answers will vary decisively by sector, four of which are described here: a state-owned sector, a privatized sector, a transactional sector, and an entrepreneurial sector. The evolving mix of these sectors will determine the future contours of the Chinese corporate economy.

349,Curiosity and well-being,"Recent conceptualizations of curiosity have identified two underlying factors that together represent trait curiosity: exploration (the disposition to seek out novel/challenging situations) and absorption (the disposition to become fully engaged in these interesting situations) (Kashdan, Rose, & Fincham, 2004). These factors have been proposed to broaden the thought-action repertoire by promoting interest in novel/challenging situations and to incrementally build knowledge and well-being in a manner consistent with the Broaden-and-Build Theory (Fredrickson, B. L., 1998). This article reports findings from a study which examined associations between the exploration and absorption components of curiosity and continuous and categorical indices of well-being. Replicating and extending previous findings, the exploration (more so than absorption) component of curiosity exhibited moderate positive associations with measures of well-being.

350,DECOY: Documenting experiences with cigarettes and other tobacco in young adults,"Objectives: We examined psychographic characteristics associated with tobacco use among Project DECOY participants. Methods: Project DECOY is a 2-year longitudinal mixed-methods study examining risk for tobacco use among 3418 young adults across 7 Georgia colleges/universities. Baseline measures included sociodemographics, tobacco use, and psychographics using the Values, Attitudes, and Lifestyle Scale. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were conducted to identify correlates of tobacco use. Results: Past 30-day use prevalence was: 13.3% cigarettes; 11.3% little cigars/cigarillos (LCCs); 3.6% smokeless tobacco; 10.9% e-cigarettes; and 12.2% hookah. Controlling for sociodemographics, correlates of cigarette use included greater novelty seeking (p <.001) and intellectual curiosity (p =.010) and less interest in tangible creation (p =.002) and social conservatism (p <.001). Correlates of LCC use included greater novelty seeking (p <.001) and greater fashion orientation (p =.007). Correlates of smokeless tobacco use included greater novelty seeking (p =.006) and less intellectual curiosity (p <.001). Correlates of e-cigarette use included greater novelty seeking (p <.001) and less social conservatism (p =.002). Correlates of hookah use included greater novelty seeking (p <.001), fashion orientation (p =.044), and self-focused thinking (p =.002), and less social conservatism (p <.001).

351,"Promoting secure multiracial identity development: A qualitative study investigating level of knowledge, awareness, and concern among parents of multiracial children","It has been widely supported through research that secure racial identity is positively correlated with overall psychological well-being and that parents are often considered the most important figures in the development and expression of racial identity. Previous research suggests that parents of multiracial individuals overwhelmingly neglect to address racial and ethnic issues both within and outside of the family home. This study reviewed current research and attempted to highlight the special role that parents play in multiracial identity development. Through phenomenological inquiry, the participants' experiences of parenting a child that is racially different from themselves and their partners were explored. Further examined were the quality and quantity of discussions that occurred between parents and their children in which the focus was on their child's racial identity. Overall, parents reported a high level of comfort and interest in discussing racial issues with their children, coupled with limited knowledge and understanding of multiracial identity and issues. Several other themes emerged including parents' emphasis on their child's physical appearance, the positive and negative aspects of integrating two or more cultures within the family, and curiosity about the racial and/or ethnic background of their child's future romantic partner. Implications of the findings for future research and practice are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Arteaga, Kelly Grace",0,,263
352,Requests for Specific Language Input: Differences between Older and Younger Adult Language Learners,"A study of the kinds of requests for foreign language information made by adult students of Spanish, and a comparison of the kinds of inquiries made by students aged 19 to 23 and those over 55 years, are reported. The objective was to learn more about what language learning processes are contributing to the difference in success of the two groups. The subjects, part of a larger study, were training as missionaries for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The older missionaries, although highly motivated, have historically had more difficulty with language training. The students kept journals about their language learning, and their topics were analyzed according to the amount of requests for ""input,"" or specific requests for more information. The results showed the younger students talked about input more than four times as much as the older students. Older adults' requests for changes in instructional elements accounted for over ten times as much journal content. Analysis of classroom inquiry showed the younger learners asked more about vocabulary and the older learners requested complete phrase repetition more often. It is suggested that: (1) older learners do not focus on input in language learning as much as younger learners do; (2) while younger learners are more concerned with what they are responsible for learning, older learners focus on its presentation; (3) there may not be a significant difference in individual requests per class; and (4) younger learners are more specific in their requests for input.

353,Fostering STEM education considering female participation gap,"Despite the technological development, the digital era, and the fact that Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) permeates all the modern world, the number of students choosing to pursue a career in STEM areas is very small in comparison to other careers. In particular, considering the gender, the gap increases even more. In this work, we present an industry-university program designed to stimulate STEM education and fostering the female interest and development in these areas. Considering our female undergrad students, the proposal was to engage them in the process, as the main agents. Our students prepared and gave lectures in schools about STEM areas. Together with some faculty members, they also developed and applied workshops based on hands-on and minds-on learning activities to spark young girls<e2><80><99> curiosity in STEM areas.

354,Some tentative suggestions respecting the data and method of political science as affording a setting for the technique of attribute-cluster-bloc identification and analysis,"In the preceding chapter reference was made to some suggestions for the more significant application of the technique of attribute-cluster-bloc identification and analysis which could not be presented in a few paragraphs. They are suggestions that do have a vital relation to one or more of all the standard fields of political inquiry there mentioned; but they are also suggestions that can best be appreciated when shown in relation collectively to a most unstandardized series of set-ups for investigation, a series which might be referred to, for want of a better title, as public opinion and behavior in governance, something of a newcomer among the subjects claiming the curiosity and interest of students of political science. Presented in such relation, it is thought, their significance may be seen to be greater than would be the case were they left as isolated suggestions touching here and there, and appearing, possibly, as strained effort to find wide application for the new technique. In reality, the technique is thought to have significance for a rather connected series of tentative suggestions for the reconsideration of current professional conceptions respecting the data and methodology of political science. None of the suggestions is entirely new, but they remain for the most part unrecognized by the bulk of students of government and politics. Further reason for the presentation of these suggestions is that they are reflections that have arisen out of actual work in the development of this technique and probing as to its possible application. Limited to such a basis, and restrained from too great extension to armchair dissertation, they might not be considered an unnecessary addition to the writings that have recently appeared relating to the scope and method of political science.

360,The Ernest Becker reader,"Ernest Becker (1924-74) was an astute observer of society and human behavior during America's turbulent 1960s and 1970s. Trained in social anthropology and driven by a transcending curiosity about human motivations, Becker doggedly pursued his basic research question, ""What makes people act the way they do?"" Dissatisfied with what he saw as narrowly fragmented methods in the contemporary social sciences and impelled by a belief that humankind more than ever needed a disciplined, rational, and empirically based understanding of itself, Becker slowly created a powerful interdisciplinary vision of the human sciences, one in which each discipline is rooted in a basic truth about the human condition. That truth became an integral part of Becker's emerging social science. Almost inadvertently, he outlined a perspective on human motivations that is perhaps the most broadly interdisciplinary to date. His perspective traverses not only the biological, psychological, and social sciences but also educational, political, humanities, and religious studies. Although Ernest Becker's life and career were cut short, his major writings have remained continually in print and have captured the interest of subsequent generations of readers. The Ernest Becker Reader (2005) makes available for the first time in one volume much of Becker's early work and thus places his later work in proper context. It is a major contribution to the ongoing interest in Becker's ideas. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Liechty, Daniel [Ed]",0,,268

Some environmental and personal factors can favor burnout onset and its serious consequences as dropping out, sleep disorders, depression, and suicide. The motivation for choosing medicine is a personal aspect that can modulate the distress with academic demands. Methods: We applied self-administered questionnaires in 277 medical students to investigate the predictive role of career choice motivations on burnout dimensions. Specifically, we studied the influence of the main reasons for choosing medicine on emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic efficacy. Results: Intellectual curiosity, professional autonomy, altruism, and interest in human relationships were the most common reasons for choosing medicine. However, the medical students motivated by personal illness or family member's illness or death revealed a significant greater emotional exhaustion when compared with the students with other motivations. Conclusion: The students who apply for medical school motivated by illness/death experiences are at a great risk for burnout. We suggest that students who are at risk for emotional exhaustion can be identified at the admission of medical school. Primary prevention strategies for burnout should consider this risk group.","Pagnin, Daniel and De Queiroz, Valeria and De Oliveira Filho, Marcio and Amaral and Anomal Gonzalez, Naira Vanessa and Teofilo Salgado, Ana and Emilia and Oliveira, Bernardo Cordeiro E and Lodi, Caio Silva and Da and Silva Melo, Raquel Muniz",0,10.3109/0142159X.2013.769673,270
363,Teaching Self-Disclosure through an Activity Exploring Disclosure Research and Online Dating Sites,"Most interpersonal communication course textbooks include a section or chapter on the topic of self-disclosure. Students are normally introduced to elements of self-disclosure, such as a definition, functions, or reasons for self-disclosure, risks of self-disclosure, and the role of self-disclosure in relationships. Historically, research on self-disclosure has focused on face-to-face interactions. Currently, however, technology is playing a pivotal role in relationship building, which ultimately affects the process and our understanding of self-disclosure (Gibbs, Ellison, & Lai, 2011). Published academic research lags behind technological innovations. Lagging yet further behind is textbook coverage of that research. For most undergraduates, technology and computer-mediated communication (CMC) play a prominent role in their social lives and, as a result, students express a natural curiosity about and interest in the role of technology in their relationships. Furthermore, issues of dating and attraction are highly relevant and appealing facets of interpersonal communication for undergraduates. Bridging issues of self-disclosure, CMC, and attraction provides a relevant context through which students can better understand disclosure processes. Like face-to-face disclosures, computer-mediated disclosures present privacy considerations, prompting the following questions: With whom should I share this information? What should I share? How much should I share? In particular, online dating sites are popular arenas for self-disclosure. People form relationships with individuals they do not know in the offline context (Gibbs et al., 2011). On these sites, self-disclosure is used as a strategy to reduce uncertainty about who the person behind the screen is and to develop a relationship. The goal of the activity described here is for students to understand self-disclosure theory through the practical application of online dating; to promote increased awareness of interpersonal communication processes in mediated contexts; and to enhance information fluency regarding the academic literature on interpersonal communication.","Baker, Nicole Marie and Hastings, Sally O",0,,271
364,How Is Young Children's Intellectual Culture of Understanding Nature Different from Adults?,"This paper explores the development of the ""ecological human brain"" in children, children's intellectual culture of ""naturalist intelligence,"" and developmentally and culturally congruent curricula for young children. In early cognitive development, nature-given perception conducts thought. In contrast, for adults, intellectual culture as a way of knowing is mostly based on perception obeying thought. Primary perceptions of children as ""bonding"" to the earth may tend to disappear if there is no social emotionally-responsive or intellectually-congruent input during the early childhood period. Naturalist intelligence is an example of an intelligence with a critical period in early childhood. Neglecting young children's interests in nature or hindering their curiosity and limiting their exploration throughout childhood can impair cognitive abilities as well as social-emotional development. The biophobic attitudes of adults may teach children to feel fear or to keep their distance from nature. Children's way of knowing nature and constructing knowledge about it should be recognized, validated, and matched with a congruent approach to teaching based on children's curiosity-centered intellectual culture.

365,Parental reflective functioning is associated with tolerance of infant distress but not general distress: Evidence for a specific relationship using a simulated baby paradigm,"Parental reflective functioning represents the capacity of a parent to think about their own and their child's mental states and how these mental states may influence behavior. Here we examined whether this capacity as measured by the Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire relates to tolerance of infant distress by asking mothers (N = 21) to soothe a life-like baby simulator (BSIM) that was inconsolable, crying for a fixed time period unless the mother chose to stop the interaction. Increasing maternal interest and curiosity in their child's mental states, a key feature of parental reflective functioning, was associated with longer persistence times with the BSIM. Importantly, on a non-parent distress tolerance task, parental reflective functioning was not related to persistence times. These findings suggest that parental reflective functioning may be related to tolerance of infant distress, but not distress tolerance more generally, and thus may reflect specificity to persistence behaviors in parenting contexts.

366,Cognitive curiosity and third age lifelong learning,"This research undertook to determine what motivates adults to continue learning while other less cognitively strenuous, and admittedly more hedonistic, choices exist. Many older adults desire to seek out and integrate knowledge about their environment, thus improving or stimulating intellectual functioning. Comparative analysis was used to determine if curiosity was a factor in older adults' desire for lifelong learning. Research subquestions were also analyzed to determine if a correlation existed between gender and curiosity in older adults. Lastly, differences between the amount of prior education experiences and curiosity and age of retirement and level of curiosity were studied. Responses from individuals 55 years and older were analyzed using Slater's (2009) Cognitive Curiosity Index (CCI). Slater specifically designed the CCI to better measure and identify cognitive curiosity. He developed and validated a survey that classified curiosity's subcategories of specific-epistemic, diversive-epistemic, specific-perceptual, and diversive-perceptual factors. The instrument was developed from research that identified the four subcategories as a specific type of cognitive curiosity. For example, the CCI identified interest in genealogy as specific epistemic or idle time interest in foods as diversive-perceptual. The survey revealed an overwhelming number (72.23%) self-diagnosed as still involved in formal or informal learning and felt they were extremely curious (96.30%). Slater's CCI corroborated respondents' self-assessment of being curious with high reliability (Cronbach's a = 0.905). Although males scored slightly higher than females in curiosity, the variance was not significant. The influences of prior education and retirement age were not statistically influenced by curiosity. Third age lifelong learners, as the largest growing age group must be able to adapt, adjust, and overcome technological and image challenges. Curiosity is a critical component in overcoming these challenges for third age adults. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

367,"Curiosity and Commercialization: Faculty Perspectives on Sponsored Research, Academic Science and Research Agendas","Given the need to compete for sponsored research funding, do university faculty believe they retain the freedom to research what is of most interest to them? The higher education literature frequently asserts that faculty research agendas are being subjugated to the demands of sponsors. An alternate perspective, from the science studies literature, posits that academic science itself is changing as some research faculty adapt to a transformed environment for knowledge production that involves new working relationships with sponsors. However, this transformation produces an altered conception of academic science that moves away from traditional normative systems such as those proposed by Robert Merton. The literature shows that academic scientists can deviate from traditional norms of research practice, but it is not known to what value systems they are gravitating. This question requires conceptualizing academic science as a social activity, understanding that faculty adaptation involves the construction of new organizing frameworks for science as they integrate conflicting values and experience ambivalence regarding their research demands. Based on an original survey collecting data from more than 1200 faculty at doctoral/research universities, the study has two areas of foci concerning academic science. The primary question addresses concerns that, owing to the need to locate extramural sponsorship for research, university faculty are losing the ability to determine their own research agendas. Following analysis of multiple conceptions, levels of perceived control in different contexts reveal complex patterns of adaptation and negotiation in relation to external circumstances. A more nuanced understanding of control emerges. The second question examines the value systems present in academic science--such as those proposed by Merton's norms--in relation to alternate views to determine whether faculty would view different academic values as legitimate or even necessary to perform research. The findings reject the notion of conventional values being predominant, and discrete types within the typology being tested were not supported. The findings indicate that faculty move among multiple value systems when conducting academic science. [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

368,Examining the use of online storytelling as a motivation for young learners to practice narrative skills,"The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the use of online storytelling as a motivation for young learners to practice narrative skills, measured through active choice, persistence and mental effort (Pintrich & Schunk, 2002). Web analytics was used to track 24 home schooled participants of an online application to teach a 21st century skill driven curriculum consisting of character driven plot story construction in a social learning environment. Additional quantitative data was collected by assignment submissions, a survey, and email exchanges with the participants. The results showed that 79.2 percent choose to engage with the application as an indicator of active choice. However, only 20.8 percent of users completed the full curriculum as an indicator of persistence by submitting a final story video. Indicator Mental Effort revealed that one fifth of the total study participants completed the scaffolded curriculum by submitting a final assignment video. Additional data suggested that curiosity may have an influence on active choice. Indicator Persistence infers that technology problems may have hampered persistence, though one outlier exhibited flow by completing the curriculum twice. As suggested by the literature, the results of this study revealed that interest was related to intrinsic motivation and engagement with the media. Additionally, instructor led feedback videos may play a role in helping learners to develop self-efficacy. This exploratory study demonstrates how meaningful measures of motivation may be used in online learning environments.

In this paper, I argue that postsettlement relations with the Goulburn River, one of the largest rivers in south-east Australia, likewise attest to the centrality of curiosity in early European engagements with Australian landscape. In mapping several relational ontologies of the Goulburn River, I attend to the socio-material practices in which this river has been performed as different and as normal. My interest is in a specific form of difference, that of antipodean difference: the river as topsy-turvy, backwards, unusual, or inverted in relation to some presumed norm, whether that norm be rooted in memories and experiences of European rivers or imaginings of an original state of nature. This is a story of how an extraordinary river became ordinary, and of how we might understand antipodean difference as curious in deed (i.e. as performed), rather than as curious indeed (i.e. as an innate quality of Australian nature). <c2><a9> 2011 Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc.","Lavau, S",0,10.1080/00049182.2011.595671,277

Treisman's interest in binocular vision was sparked by her discovery of a handheld stereoscope in one of the laboratories at the Institute of Experimental Psychology at Oxford (perhaps among the many other magical objects populating Richard Gregory's lab). Intrigued by the device and the opportunity it afforded to stimulate the two eyes independently, Anne decided to have some fun creating stereo pictures. She freely admits that this foray into binocular vision was motivated by amateur curiosity unconstrained by knowledge of the literature. The results from her exploration testify to the possibilities available to an inquiring mind relatively uncontaminated by preconceptions. The 1962 paper was organized around several related questions, and the following sections summarize those questions and Treisman's answers to them. Also included are commentaries on subsequent research whose roots can be traced back to Treisman's 1962 paper.

377,The enlightening problem,"The legends and folklore of antiquity are filled with riddles and puzzles which served as stimuli to thinking as well as provision for amusement. The constructive as well as the erroneous thinking of man has been the result of speculation and wondering. It has long been recognized that problems kindle speculation and provide a motivation for thinking. Specific applications to the processes of formal learning, however, of this truth, like that of other truths that are more or less obvious, waited long because its fundamental value was unrecognized. Yet in one form or another the problem has been used more in schoolwork than any other means of grouping facts or any other organization of subject matter. There is a real significance in the use of the problem in school learning that is justified by what is known of how children learn. As was stated in the first chapter, the basis for all learning consists in the instinctive tendencies with which a person is equipped at birth. One of these tendencies that is recognized under different names is frequently called curiosity. Like other instinctive tendencies instinctive curiosity varies in strength among people. Some people are more inclined to wonder and speculate than others; some people are more inclined to acceptance of what goes on about them than others. Both tendencies are early influenced by learning, and by the time a child reaches school, great modifications have occurred. One of the more noticeable characteristics of children even then, however, is their curiosity respecting all manner of life about them and the world in which they live. When a child is placed in an unusual situation, such as being taken to a circus, the barrage of questioning is well nigh overwhelming to a more complacent adult. In addition to this justification for the use of problems, which is due to an instinctive trait of curiosity, there is a further justification due to the results of experience. As was shown in an earlier chapter,^ the learned basis of interest lies in the meaningfulness of experience. The meaningfulness gives rise to interest, the feeling that draws the learner to the learning, and leads the learner to desire to connect something unknown with something that he knows. The problem, in this case, is merely the connective link between the known and the unknown.

378,Developing Creativity of Schoolchildren through the Course ``Developmental Mathematics'',"The relevance of the present study is due to the importance of developing creativity which can be achieved through a variety of school subjects including mathematics. In the article the potential of extended (supplementary) mathematical education (in primary and secondary schools) is highlighted. The main objective of this study is to examine and evaluate the contents, practices and methods that are currently employed in extended education. The main empirical method of this study is modeling of the modular system of lessons (the course) that offers a variety of assignments including non-standard tasks, puzzles and problems; tasks and topics from academic Olympiads and other mathematical competitions; creative tasks, practical assignments and experiments with mathematical materials (''empirical'' mathematics); team and individual competitions and organization of home readings on a specific subject. The article describes the author's methodology. The main feature of the developed course is the inclusion of various organizational forms and diverse materials aimed at sustaining schoolchildren's interest towards mathematics, enabling them to deal with advanced level mathematical problems and developing their curiosity and creativity. The course ``Developmental Mathematics'' that is presented in this article has been empirically tested since 2008.","Gorev, Pavel M and Masalimova, Alfiya R and Mukhametzyanova, Farida and Sh. and Makarova, Elena V",0,10.12973/eurasia.2017.00698a,283
379,Personality and boredom proneness in the prediction of creativity and curiosity,"The present study investigated the contributions of an overall personality taxonomy (HEX-ACO) and boredom proneness to creativity and curiosity. Past research has indicated that creativity and curiosity are related processes that are informed by personality variables. Prior, largely theoretical, work also suggests that the tendency to experience boredom may be linked to creativity and curiosity. In the present study, hierarchical multiple regressions were used to evaluate the role of personality and boredom proneness in the prediction of creativity and curiosity. The results confirmed the importance of personality (especially Openness to Experience) as an important predictor of creativity and curiosity. Furthermore, we found that boredom proneness was a positive predictor of curiosity in several forms once its shared variance with overall personality structure was partialled out. In addition, while the literature has found that boredom as a state triggers creativity, the results of this study indicate that boredom as a personality trait is not predictive of creativity. These findings suggest several interesting possibilities. Of note, if its inhibited qualities could be overcome, boredom proneness might be able to play a positive role in curiosity.

Curiosity, psychological mindedness, and regression in the service of the ego are discussed. Curiosity is considered as (a) constant hunger for new sensory experience, (b) outwardly directed, and (c) active in nature. Psychological mindedness includes (a) sensitivity to symbolic meanings; (b) intense interest, sensitivity, and empathy for people and particularly for their affective experiences; and (c) interest and curiosity about behavior and the motives that underlie it. Recommendations are made for the nurturance of creativity in the research scientist.

381,Creative Little Scientists: exploring pedagogical synergies between inquiry-based and creative approaches in Early Years science,"In the light of the European Union's interest in creativity and innovation, this paper, drawing on data from the EU project Creative Little Scientists (2011<e2><80><93>2014), explores the teaching and learning of science and creativity in Early Years education. The project's conceptual framework, developed from detailed analysis of relevant literatures, highlighted the potential existence of a number of pedagogical synergies between inquiry-based science and creativity-based approaches in Early Years education. The science and creativity literature reviews were thus re-examined to identify synergistic features of teaching and learning in the Early Years. These were seen to include: play and exploration, motivation and affect, dialogue and collaboration, problem-solving and agency, questioning and curiosity, reflection and reasoning, and teacher scaffolding and involvement. Field work undertaken over a 4-month-period in 48 sites across the 9 partner countries provided the opportunity to examine the existence of these synergies in Early Years settings and primary classrooms with learners aged 3<e2><80><93>8<e2><80><85>years. Qualitative in nature, the fieldwork was framed by a case study strategy encompassing multiple methods of data collection: sequential digital images capturing interactions; observations supplemented by audio recording; timelines; and interviews with teachers and groups of children. The data set comprised 71 cases in early science (and mathematics), with 3 episodes of activity per case encapsulating creativity in these domains, resulting in 218 episodes for analysis. A deductive<e2><80><93>inductive analytical approach was undertaken in two phases with cross-case analysis both within and between countries. The paper exemplifies the pedagogical synergies innovatively identified in the conceptual framework and documented in the fieldwork, and highlights the potential for creativity in exploratory science contexts. Additionally, it highlights differences between practice observed in preschool and primary settings and advances a new conceptual definition of creativity within Early Years science education. <c2><a9> 2015, <c2><a9> 2015 ASPE.","Cremin, T and Glauert, E and Craft, A and Compton, A and Stylianidou, F",0,10.1080/03004279.2015.1020655,286
382,Civilization and war,"Civilization and war were born around the same time in roughly the same place - they have effectively grown up together. This challenges the belief that the more civilized we become, the less likely the resort to war in order to resolve differences and disputes. The related assumption that civilized societies are more likely to abide by the rules of war is also in dispute. Where does terrorism fit into debates about civilized and savage war? What are we to make of talk about an impending <e2><80><98>clash of civilizations<e2><80><99>? In a succinct yet wide ranging survey of history and of ideas that calls in to question a number of conventional wisdoms, Civilization and War explores these issues and more whilst outlining the two-way relationship between civilization and war. Providing an alternative perspective to conventional thinking, this book will appeal to a wide interdisciplinary audience across all regions of the globe. The material is both original and highly topical and is written in a sharp, snappy style that makes it accessible to a wide readership, including upper-level undergraduates, postgraduates, academic specialists and informed general readers. Civilization and War makes important contributions to the fields of international relations, peace and conflict studies, political theory and the history of ideas, and will be of interest to people with a curiosity about world history and current affairs. <c2><a9> Brett Bowden 2013.

384,Narrative inquiry into possible shifts in sense of self in seasoned yoga practitioners,"The psychology literature in the United States (U.S.) is largely silent on the experiences of seasoned, relatively healthy adult yoga practitioners, yet these experiences may be of interest to healthcare providers, policymakers, and future researchers. The purpose of the study was to explore possible shifts in sense of self in seasoned U.S. yoga practitioners as described by them in their own words. Western psychology researchers have not focused on this topic and population (Kramer, 2008). Indian psychology researchers focused on self-transformation narratives by esteemed Indian yogis, but these might or might not relate to the experiences of seasoned U.S. yoga practitioners (Rao & Paranjpe, 2008). To help address the silence in the literature, the researcher gathered narratives from 4 women and 2 men between ages 30 and 65 who practiced yoga at least 4 hours a week for 7 years or more. Participants answered open-ended interview questions to describe themselves, their yoga practices, and how yoga might or might not have impacted their thoughts and feelings about themselves. When analyzed using holistic content analysis (Mazur, 2012), the 6 participants' narratives revealed experiences of shifts in sense of self over time with consistent yoga practice. These included shifts in physical sense of self, shifts from physical awareness to mental and emotional awareness, shifts in breath as a bridge to other shifts, shifts to more positive feelings, centering shifts, increased freedom and choice, and shifts in connecting with others. Supplemental themes included proof through practice and continued evolution of practice as well as complex descriptions of themselves which involved others, curiosity, and physical attributes. Themes shared by these 6 participants paralleled themes in the research literature such as increased volitional control and transformation. However, the narratives also extended the literature to include seasoned, healthy adult U.S. yoga practitioners' experiences in their own frameworks and words. They raised questions ripe for additional inquiry such as whether similar themes might emerge in a larger sample. The narratives also suggested considerations relevant to international psychology approaches to yoga research. These findings may be of interest to healthcare providers, policymakers, and future researchers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Grace, Lily",0,,288
385,Curiosity and meaning of life leading towards personal growth: The role of emotional intelligence,"Curiosity is innate character strength of an individual motivating oneself to investigate and learn about the subject matter of interest leading towards the personal and professional satisfaction in life. Meaning in life charts the way of regulating and directing attention to continuously evaluate one's personal values and life goals. Emotional intelligence influences an individual's physical and mental health as well as career aspirations and achievements in changing environmental situations. All these three factors may possibly influence an individual's present and past experiences to forecast one's potential areas for growth and development in the form of personal growth initiative. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to assess the influence of curiosity and meaning of life on one's personal growth, moderated with emotional intelligence. The empirical study has been carried out with the professional students of a premier technical institution in India. Results have revealed that personal growth initiative is positively associated with curiosity and meaningful life. Findings have indicated that both the constructs are significantly moderated by emotional intelligence for predicting personal growth. <c2><a9> Journal of the Indian Academy of Applied Psychology.","Mohanty, A and Pradhan, R K and Jena, L K",0,,289
387,Rethinking the absence of post-Western International Relations theory in India: â€˜Advaitic monismâ€™ as an alternative epistemological resource,"The transformation of the Eurocentric epistemological base of International Relations, without inadvertently generating a <e2><80><98>derivative discourse<e2><80><99> of Western International Relations, requires an intellectual flight over rigid boundaries of Western scientism, thereby reorienting the discipline of International Relations itself towards a post-Western epoch. As such, post-Western International Relations theory can be largely viewed as an offspring of scholastic explorations aimed at breaking epistemological imperialism in International Relations. Not surprisingly, the non-Western <e2><80><98>rising powers<e2><80><99> in global politics are taking particular interest in designing a post-Western International Relations theory. While the notion of <e2><80><98>Tianxia<e2><80><99> has emerged as a Chinese conceptual response to the budding intellectual curiosity surrounding post-Western International Relations, the Indian scholarly scepticism towards formulating <e2><80><98>systemic<e2><80><99> theories projects a hazy image of the status of post-Western International Relations theory in India. This article aims at reconsidering the absence of post-Western International Relations theory in India by evaluating the fundamental Indian scriptures as a potential epistemological guide to theorise International Relations. In order to do that, the article awakens the concept of <e2><80><98>Advaita<e2><80><99> as an untapped epistemological resource. The article is divided into four sections. The first section traces the academic space for post-Western International Relations theorisation in India. The second section evokes the notion of <e2><80><98>Advaita<e2><80><99> as an epistemological-methodological tool to craft post-Western International Relations theory.

391,Assessing the Development of Preschoolers,"To assess whether or not a child's development is going well, preschool teachers might ask the following questions: Does the child fall asleep easily and wake rested? Does the child eat with appetite? On the average, over a period of 3 or 4 weeks, does the child have bowel and bladder control? Does the child exhibit a range of emotions? Does the child's play vary over a period of time? Does the child occasionally exhibit curiosity, adventure, and even mischief? Does the child usually accept adult authority? Can the child initiate, maintain, and enjoy a relationship with one or more children? Is the child capable of sustained involvement, absorption, and interest in something outside of himself or herself? Does the child express spontaneous affection for one or more adults? Is the child capable of enjoying the potentially ""good things of life,"" such as going on picnics and exploring new places or materials? The first three questions are particularly sensitive indicators of the child's development. The remaining questions, representing preschool teachers' most important goals for their pupils, can be easily inquired about or observed directly. Observation of a child's functioning on these criteria over a period of 3 weeks provides data usually sufficient for assessment purposes.

392,The exploration of complexity and the complexity of exploration,"Considers the contribution of the work of W. N. Dember and his colleagues both in preparing the field of psychology to incorporate nonhomeostatic motives into psychological theory and to develop the importance of Dember's work in light of current research on exploratory activity. The 1st section focuses on the work of Dember and others in identifying the connection between stimulus complexity and an actor's interest in exploring the stimulus pattern. This work helps inject the study of curiosity and exploration into psychology and set the stage for a recent series of experiments that stresses the essential role of actor's exploratory activities for revealing information for guiding goal-directed action. The 2nd part of the chapter argues that the outcome of this research, to date, highlights the importance of the problem on which Dember and his colleagues were working. Topics discussed include: the exploration of complexity, the complexity of exploratory activity, information about the layout of surfaces, and information about the perceiver's action capabilities.

393,Online information encountering: modeling the process and influencing factors,"Purpose - Information encountering is the serendipitous acquisition of information that requires low or no involvement and expectation of users. The purpose of this paper is to model the explicit process and the implicit factors of online information encountering, i.e. how and why it occurs. Design/methodology/approach - The critical incident technique was adopted to collect qualitative data from 16 interview participants. They contributed 27 true incidents of online information encountering which were used to identify the key phases of the encountering process. They also commented on the factors that they thought had an influence on the chance of the occurrence of encountering. Findings - The macro-process of information encountering is composed of three phases. First, browsing, searching, or social interaction provides the context for encountering; second, the encountering occurrence consists of three steps - noticing the stimuli, examining the content, and acquiring interesting or useful content; and third, the information encountered will be explored further, saved, used, or shared. The 14 influencing factors of information encountering obtained divide into three clusters. User-related factors include sensitivity, emotions, expertise, attitudes, intentionality, curiosity, activity diversity; information-related factors include type, relevance, quality, visibility, and sources; and environment-related factors include time limits and interface usability. Originality/value - This study engenders useful implications for designing information encountering experience. The changeable nature of some influencing factors suggests that encountering can be elicited through the purposive design of encountering support features or even encountering systems, and the macro- process depicts the natural occurring mechanisms of encountering for the design to follow.","Jiang, Tingting and Liu, Fang and Chi, Yu",0,10.1108/JD-07-2014-0100,295
394,The audiologist's handbook of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring,"This book serves as a basic introduction and provides information about some aspects of neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring. The contents of this book will be instructive and that the book will engender sufficient interest and curiosity so that the reader will endeavor to seek additional information about this interesting and clinically effective field. The book represents author's attempt to share some of his experience with audiology colleagues and other health care providers who are interested in or have already ventured into the operating room. It focuses on cranial nerve monitoring, and the author tried to make it as practical and straightforward as possible. The digital companion version also has some videos illustrating neurophysiologic events occurring during surgical procedures. The book is organised into 14 chapters. The initial chapters of the book focuses on some basic tenets of electromyography and evoked potential recording and some neuroanatomy. The last two chapters focus on considerations for establishing a neuromonitoring program and specific protocols. Chapter 14 also includes five specific protocols set up in a table format that could be used step-by-step in the operating room to set up and conduct a neuromonitoring protocol for a specific surgical procedure. While the primary purpose of this book is to describe cranial nerve intraoperative monitoring most commonly encountered by audiologists. Chapter 11 also includes information about somatosensory evoked potentials that need to be used along with cranial nerve monitoring in lower skull base tumor surgery. Additionally, one of the specific protocols that follows Chapter 14 is for somatosensory evoked potentials. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)","Kileny, Paul R",0,,296
395,Parenting and child socialization in contemporary China,"The ostensible peculiarities, as well as similarities, of parenting and child socialization in China vis-a-vis Western countries such as the United States have been capturing intellectual curiosity and creating debate among investigators in the past few decades. Drawing on relatively recent empirical research in three major Chinese societies (mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), we attempt in this chapter to depict a state-of-the-art picture of parenting and child socialization in contemporary China. Particular attention will be paid to the growing body of research conducted with only children in urban areas of mainland China, given that they constitute a substantial proportion of the youth population in contemporary Chinese societies. In reviewing the extant literature, we search for answers to three questions that have been of enduring or burgeoning interest to investigators. First, how do Western frameworks characterizing parenting and child socialization apply in China, a culture commonly believed to be interdependence-oriented, in contrast to many Western cultures, such as the United States, commonly believed to be independence-oriented? Second, what are the notions of parenting and child socialization indigenous to Chinese culture that may be absent or under-examined in the existing Western frameworks? Third, how does the portrait of typical Chinese parenting as hierarchical, authoritarian, and gender-unequal hold, given the drastic economic, societal, and cultural changes that have been rapidly taking place in contemporary Chinese societies, particularly in mainland China? We conclude with our insights into these issues and discuss emerging and future directions for research on Chinese parenting and child socialization.

396,Art integration: Exploring a transdisciplinary practice in rural art education,"The kindergarten through twelfth-grade curriculum often separates academic disciplines, student interests, and the local culture and geography. This division of information can discourage students from connecting overarching concepts to the relationship of lived experiences. Therefore, bridging these ideas together helps provide educational significance and personal meaning while encouraging learners to develop a sense of place. My dissertation explores how rural students make these connections through the research and artmaking process. In a semester-long ethnographically informed investigation, I collaborated with an art instructor to research within her high school class, Art Experiences. We used an art integrative place-based framework to guide our inquiry. To ground our research in a classroom setting, we modeled the curriculum after art educator and theorist Julia Marshall's (2014a) art integrative transdisciplinary approach---Art Research Integration (ARI). ARI positions students as artist-researchers who independently explore topics of interest through thematic investigation. This process encourages learners to connect overarching concepts with their lives outside of school. Following Marshall's model, students in our study embraced the artist-researcher role. To support lived experiences from a cultural and geographic perspective, we intertwined ARI with place-based inquiry. Its inclusion aimed to foster learners' curiosity about the surrounding rural area. Through investigation of an individualized locally-themed question, each student followed a unique research trail. Learners documented their research in sketchbooks which provided them a space to brainstorm ideas, create concept maps, and archive resources. Students drew sketches to express what they had learned from their exploration. Using their sketches as inspiration, students created works of art to complement their research findings. During my inquiry, I examined how students explored diverse academic subjects, their interests, and the local area using an art integrative place-based approach. I focused on explicating how and in what ways learners wove together academic disciplinary knowledge, how ARI facilitated a transdisciplinary process of learning, and the ways using a place-based rural perspective helped to understand learner decision making better. Answering these questions provided insight into the ways learners became artist-researchers, understood content interconnectivity, and linked lived experience with place to enhance personal meaning.

402,Initiative and Purpose in the Motoric Explorations of 10- to 24-Month-Old Children: An Educator's Interpretation of a Geneva Study,"This document, the first in a four-part series, presents a synopsis of a Geneva research report delivered at Cornell University (New York). It describes a study in which 10-month-old infants were given intermittent free-play opportunities to manipulate 18 objects. Regularly presented in disarray were 6 balls, 6 sticks, and 6 open cubes; each set was graduated in size. Repeated viewings of videotaped behaviors revealed a consistent pattern and succession of organizing practices which were implemented spontaneously and universally over the course of 14 months. Also spontaneous and universal was the abrupt cessation of the organizing behaviors following a final, perfect, continuous review of all the organizing patterns which had previously been practiced. It is argued that the contrived setup used in the study, which regularly presented the same three sets of objects in disarray, stimulated the children's curiosity and motivated the acts of initiative which occurred. Properties of the objects and the disarray induced purposeful explorations, enhanced and sustained constructive interest, and prompted the repetitive displays of relation among the objects. It is thought that the abrupt cessation of the organizing practices marked the time when the relations were no longer held in question by the young children, but rather were known by them (i.e., internalized as schemes). The internalization accounts for the reappearance of the practiced schemes later when the children were faced with new problems. (RH)","Bentley, Prudence A",0,,302
403,The differences in pleasing value and learning performance among different groups using mobile augmented reality system for cultural environment learning,"Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) has becomes more widely used and provides the great context of an immersive virtual learning environment. However, sometimes the learning effect is influenced by the pleasing value, which is always subjective and learning driven. In order to ensure a successful launch of the MAR cultural interactive learning tool, it is extremely important to predict the pleasing value of design alternatives based on the common language understood by students. For learners, in the learning process, the value of pleasure comes from the improvement of external emotional interest as well as internal cognitive interest that learners already have. This research will examine if students have problems with operating the MAR, and to understand whether they have pleasing value and a learning performance. Thus, this research has proposed a difference of visual perception and a construction for the evaluation of pleasing value as well as the culture of learning performance between media students and students in other majors. The research team has chosen different cultural temples in Shi-lin and Tam-sui in Taiwan using the MAR systems to evaluate the correctness and speed of the reaction in between the two groups represented as: the experimental group and the control group.

404,An analytical interpretation of New Testament parables,"In the last century psychological researchers devoted much attention to the impact, both positive and negative, of religion on human behavior and individuals<e2><80><99> mental health. Analytical psychology, a branch of depth psychology, has displayed a keen interest in religion. Carl Jung, the architect of analytical psychology, wrote extensively about religion, and some of the practitioners and researchers who followed Jung also had much to say about the impact of religion on human behavior. This author, in the tradition of analytical psychology, examines five parables from the New Testament Gospel of Luke. How the author arrived at this topic is chronicled in the first section. The positives and negatives of church life did much to create a curiosity about how religion affects mental health. Next, a review of the literature related to myth, Biblical myth, Jung<e2><80><99>s writings related to religion, and the work of Jung<e2><80><99>s predecessors related to religion is reviewed. A thorough discussion of the history of depth psychology leads to an examination of Jung<e2><80><99>s theory. In order to make a thorough, contextual examination of these parables, the author utilizes two modes of interpretation. First, in order to place the parables in their context, the parables are interpreted using the historical-critical method of Biblical interpretation. Once the contexts of the parables were clarified, an analytical interpretation was performed, in a fashion similar to interpreting a dream. The interpretation of a dream requires a dreamer to amplify the symbols in a dream, and the historical-critical interpretation was used to amplify the symbols in the parables. These parables displayed the importance of the equitable distribution of energy in the psyche. The story-lines in these parables exhibited the symbolic use and misuse of wealth and power. When wealth was used to make a situation better, psychically, we had a better distribution of psychic energy. When wealth was used to maintain social convention, psychically, we had a destructive situation. The misuse of power either clinically or analytically proves to be detrimental to mental health.","Covert  II, William H and Covert, William H",0,,304
405,Resistance to monolingualism: Reviving our languages,"When the first Europeans arrived in Oregon, it appears that the most common Native response was curiosity and an interest in the new trade goods that the Europeans brought with them. As the numbers of newcomers increased, however, and they began imposing their way of life on the people and natural environment of the state, Native Americans began to resist the encroachment. They resisted by not allowing themselves to be completely assimilated into the new culture and by practicing their own ways of life and speaking their own languages. This chapter focuses on Native Americans in Oregon who are involved in the revitalization of their languages as teachers and learners. Today there are efforts to revitalize ten of these languages (Cayuse- Nez Perce, Chinuk Wawa, Klamath, Northern Paiute, Tolowa, Tututni, Umatilla, Walla Walla, Warm Springs, and Wasco).1 Some language programs have been established for several years and others are just beginning. Three of the language programs encompass several of the languages spoken on the reservation. The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs teach Warm Springs Wasco and Northern Paiute. The language program of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla encompasses Cayuse-Nez Perce, Umatilla, and Walla Walla. The Klamath Tribes have recently begun supporting a Northern Paiute teacher in addition to their work on Klamath. This complicates their mission at the same time that it respects the multilingual pattern of traditional Native American life in this area. There are also individuals who have put a lot of work into learning a language of their ancestors without the benefit of a language program. Our focus here is on individuals within programs that have some level of institutional support. Though the level of support from tribal councils and from public schools varies greatly from one program to the next and funding fluctuates from year to year, all the programs have teachers who struggle with curriculum and at least a few students who are eager to learn. During 2004 and 2005, we interviewed fifty- Two Oregon Natives who are administrators of tribal language programs, Native language teachers, and students. Similar themes emerged from these interviews that I will address in this chapter. First, I examine the generational linkages through which indigenous languages were maintained in some families, then the way people temporarily ""lost"" their language. Most teachers of Oregon languages today did not continuously speak their native language. Some of them spoke the language when they were young and then went through a period of several years when they didn't speak it. Others didn't speak it or spoke very little when they were young, but put great effort into learning it as young adults. Both groups went through a process of ""discovering"" their ancestral language. The first group went through a process of remembering the language while the second had to learn it anew. The final part of the chapter focuses on their experiences of breathing new life into Oregon Native languages. I hope that reading the words of Native Oregonians will give the reader an enriched understanding of what it means to be an indigenous person with a heritage language. <c2><a9> 2007 by The Oregon State University Press.

407,Further developmental stages of the interest in money,"Interviewed 18 suburban children (aged 2-18 yrs) to informally test further human developmental stages of the interest in money beyond that traced by S. Ferenczi (1950). The youngest children related money to the love of their parents and grandparents. Further stages that are discussed include curiosity about money as a belonging of the parents in oedipal-stage grasp of family politics; money as a reward and exchange in latency trading; and money as a measure of status and class and as an indication of group identity in adolescence. There are various levels of the appreciation of money as a system of universal agreement, as a translatable, fungible form of information to register relative value, and as capital, an ingredient of productivity. Ultimately money is fully separated from the self in acts of riddance and gifting.

408,"Visiting Open Dialogue: 'What it is, what it looks like and how it is experienced.'","Comments on an article by Judith M. Brown (see record 2013-03505-002). Open Dialogue Approach as evolved in Western Lapland, Finland, has evoked interest in many foreign therapists. There has been a growing curiosity to come and see how it works in practice. But how can you show your work to a foreigner, who doesn't understand the Finnish language? Our work is talking, having conversations. Does a foreigner get an idea of what we are doing without understanding words? That has been a question we have asked ourselves. Now we have got an answer. I read with enthusiasm the pieces of Judith's reflective journal. In those passages she describes nicely what I see happening in open meetings with our patients. Open Dialogue for me is more than an approach. Having been involved in it since the 1980s, I believe it has changed me as a human being. If Open Dialogue is taken only as a method, it will not work. If team members have reflecting conversations methodologically, they become a play. You move to exercising power and trying to feed your own 'truth' to other people. Reflecting conversations should always arise from genuine interest, curiosity and a willingness to understand more. The article describes many important aspects of our work, practices and theoretical ideas. Yet for me it is especially valuable to read how it was 'experienced'.

409,Children's experiences of visiting a seriously ill/injured relative on an adult intensive care unit,"Aim: This paper is a report of a study of children's experiences of visiting a seriously ill/injured relative in an intensive care unit. Background: Little attention has been paid to children's experiences and needs when visiting a relative being cared for at a high technological adult intensive care unit. Instead, the focus has been on adult's experiences and needs. Method: In 2004, 28 children (14 girls, 14 boys) aged 4-17 years who had visited an adult relative were interviewed 3 months after the visit. A hermeneutic approach was used when interpreting and analysing the text. Findings: Four themes were generated from the data: It meant waiting, It was strange, It was white and It was good. Waiting was experienced as difficult, increasing the feeling of uncertainty, exclusion and separation, which in turn led to tension and concern. 'It was strange' was perceived as unfamiliar but also with interest and curiosity. The experience of the intensive care unit was that it was white. Everything in the patient's room was experienced as white and gloomy. It lacked joy. 'It was good' was stated about the outcome of the visit because through this they were given the opportunity to meet and see the relative by themselves. This evoked feelings of relief and joy. The visit did not seem to frighten the child; instead it generated feelings of release and relief. Conclusion: Children's experiences of visiting an adult intensive care unit seem to support theories that emphasize the involvement and participation of children in family matters.

Gliding locomotion utilizes the difference between two orthogonal reaction forces to propel. Since this locomotion principle is very interesting and difficult to intuitively understand, its way of locomotion effectively evokes intellectual curiosity of students. One actuated degree of freedom (DOF) fish-like educational robot and its lecture program are developed for primary, junior high and high school students. And a snake-like educational robot which can connect arbitrary number of units, and its lecture program are developed for university students. We carried out these programs through several lectures.

412,Geology and environment between Canossa and Quattro Castella: An innovative geological map for the general public,"A basic geological knowledge is a powerful tool for increasing public awareness of the need for a balanced relationship between citizens and the environment, but often geology does not attract the interest of the general public because it seems to be dealing with something too distant, in time and space, from our everyday life. The aim of this kind of `innovative geological cartography' is to bring geology to the general public, by stimulating the innate curiosity that is harboured by every human being. This initiative, realised by the Emilia-Romagna Region, falls within the category that can be defined, in a broad sense, as `geological tourism'. In this new frontier the mission of cartography is to transform geological maps into something comprehensible by not only geologists but also the general public. In this map (the Italian version is furnished with a booklet where several topics are investigated thoroughly), the Matilde di Canossa myth and the `living' landscape are used as tools to arouse the attention of the casual reader, demonstrating a fundamental principle-that Lyell's `Actualism': geology is a science that wants to prepare the future through the study of the past.","Bertolini, G and Centineo, M C and Pignone, R and Segadelli, S",0,,311
413,In the absence of Meaningâ‹¯,"There are many diagnoses of the bad state of U.S. mathematics education, ranging from incoherent curricula to low-quality teaching. In this chapter I will address a foundational reason for the many manifestations of failure - a systemic, cultural inattention to mathematical meaning and coherence. The result is teachers' inability to teach for understanding and students' inability to develop personal mathematical meanings that support interest, curiosity, and future learning. In developing this argument I discuss the subtle ways in which actual meanings with which teachers currently teach and actual meanings students currently develop in interaction with instruction contribute to dysfunctional mathematics education. I end by proposing a long-term strategy to address this situation. <c2><a9> 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York. All rights are reserved.","Thompson, P W",0,10.1007/978-1-4614-6977-3-4,312

The book amply satisfies the stated hope that the variation in stimulation experienced by the reader ""contribute to his interest and enjoyment, especially as he notes the common elements and themes underlying the diversity"". There is great variability in the adequacy with which the authors' conceptual scheme is able to comprehend the numerous phenomena considered.

Instead, it is the expanded and perhaps unwieldly outcome of my own curiosity as to what others have learned regarding the effects of endocrine secretion upon the behavior of animals, including man."" The book is organized in terms of general categories of behavior such as courtship and mating; reversal or bisexuality of mating behaviorism; emotion; the role of nervous stimulation; homeostasis, metabolism, metamorphosis and moulting, etc. Although at first glance the book would seem to be beyond the interest of most psychiatrists and other psychiatric workers, it reads with surprising ease and holds the attention remarkably.

419,The Learning Helix,"This paper discusses a mental model of learning based on the processes of attention, perception, processing, and application. The learning process starts with attention, such as curiosity, excitement, expectation, or fear; in pedagogy this is called motivation. New impressions are dependent on and interpreted against the background of previous experience and learning, or ""frame of reference."" One of the main reasons for using pictures in magazines, newspapers, and books is to draw attention to the material; in the case of moving images, the visual material and presentation must constantly redraw the attention to hold the viewer's interest. The concept ""perception"" is a collective designation for the processes in which an individual obtains information on the outside world. The""laws"" of perception include: figure/ground contrast; similarity; proximity; continuity; closure; common fate; objective set; contrast; and previous experience. Information processing and storage is referred to as memory. Memory functions include sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory; forgetting is the process through which information in memory becomes inaccessible. Results from several experiments show that when contents are the same in visual, audio, and print channels, learning is maximized. After the attention, perception, and processing of information, new knowledge can be applied and tested in different applications. Four figures depict these processes, including the combination of all processes in the learning helix model. (Contains 51 references.) (AEF)","Pettersson, Rune",0,,317

426,An aesthetic approach to the teaching of science,"The role of aesthetic curiosity in the manipulation of materials is often ignored or considered irrelevant in most science curricula. Contemporary practice in curriculum design emphasizes an approach that views science and art as separate types of explorations. Some historians of technology and science suggest that basic discoveries arise out of an aesthetic curiosity fostered by play with materials or ideas. Experience with certain familiar materials of aesthetic interest suggest that children will sustain play for long periods and easily mix metaphors of art and science in developing an understanding of the phenomena that are a part of the experience. Several examples are given of how this might be accomplished. Copyright <c2><a9> 1982 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company","Zubrowski, B",0,10.1002/tea.3660190509,320

While most computer program in a variety of games has been designed to be a competitive opponent, it had derailed from one of the crucial aspects of games: fosters learning. This paper proposes a paradigm shift, from the foregoing methods of optimal play to sophisticated game design in the context of learning. A new theory, called ``Momentum-in-Mind'' ((p) over right arrow) was proposed and its relationship to the Game Refinement (GR) theory was conducted where the preliminary understanding of game sophistication in the context of curiosity, uncertainty and its application to game design were identified. We applied it to two distinct game genres (fun and educational) to identify its sophisticated zone and potential learning curves. It was found that curiosity and uncertainty decrease in most educational games where a good balance between the values of GR and p is important in order to maintain players interest and their learning growth rate. As such, the findings of this study presents as a paradigm shift in game research, where the focus has shifted towards a sophisticated environment which optimally designed for learning and enjoyment.","Agarwal, Sakshi and Khalid, Mohd Nor Akmal and Iida, Hiroyuki",0,10.1016/j.entcom.2019.100314,321

When users investigate unfamiliar fields, they may want to learn more about a particular subject area to increase their knowledge rather than solve a specific problem. This work proposes a topic-oriented exploratory search method that provides browse guidance to users. It allows them to discover new associations and knowledge, and helps them find their interested information and knowledge. Since an exploratory search needs to judge the ability to discover new knowledge, the existing commonly used metrics fail to capture it. This paper thus defines a new set of criteria containing clarity, relevance, novelty, and diversity to analyze the effectiveness of an exploratory search. Experiments are designed to compare results from the proposed method and Google's ``search related to ...'' The results show that the proposed one is more suitable for learning new associations and discovering new knowledge with highly likely relevance to a query. This work concludes that it is more suitable than Google for an exploratory search.","Sun, HaiChun and Jiang, ChangJun and Ding, ZhiJun and Wang, PengWei and Zhou, MengChu",0,10.1109/TSMC.2015.2421484,322

435,Stanislaw Estreicher: The forgotten master of Bronislaw Malinowski,"The quest for scientific inspiration has, apart from satisfying the curiosity of the kind of <e2><80><9c>where did he take it from?"", at least two more values. Above all, it allows for a better understanding of a given scientific work, not only of its assumptions but also of its final solutions. Additionally, it enables a proper assessment of the originality of the thought, as well as the evaluation of the contribution into the existing state of knowledge made by a scientist. In the case of Bronislaw Malinowski, there can be distinguished another specific reason for the search of his scientific roots-the reason resulting from his complex biography. Usually, it proves relatively easy to identify both persons, as well as works that exerted a significant influence on the manner of conducting research work and results obtained by a scientist. The answer to the question about his intellectual-and, possibly, personal-master usually does not pose a problem for historians. Bronislaw Malinowski, however, <e2><80><9c>appeared<e2><80><9d> on the scene of the world science from <e2><80><9c>out of nowhere<e2><80><9d>, from the remote intellectual corners of then <e2><80><9c>eastern Europe<e2><80><9d>, barely known in the West. He came from the society whose great past had already been-willingly and partly intentionally-long forgotten and which was not able to present its scientific achievements on the international scene of knowledge as a politically independent state. It was in such specific historical conditions of the early twentieth century that Bronislaw Malinowski embarked on his scientific career, entering the circles of the British social science, which, although still leading in many fields, was forced to face the growing <e2><80><9c>global<e2><80><9d> competition from the United States. In the years 1910-1913, Malinowski was still merely one of many <e2><80><9c>exotic<e2><80><9d> students of the London School of Economics. Already at that time, however, his opinions frequently met with interest from the narrow circle of his peers. It was only after 1927, upon his appointment to the Chair of Anthropology as a professor of the London University, that he entered the pedestal of the <e2><80><9c>world<e2><80><9d> science. A significant part of his further scientific achievements was made under the brand of this excellent <e2><80><9c>company<e2><80><9d>: as a British professor, the author of the <e2><80><9c>British ethnology of culture<e2><80><9d> or <e2><80><9c>British field researcher<e2><80><9d>, etc. Years later, while being introduced to the honoris causa degree at the Harvard University (1936), he was thus titled in the laudation, whereas his <e2><80><9c>Polish roots<e2><80><9d> were mentioned merely out of politeness. However, on his arrival to London, the young Malinowski had already boasted the excellent PhD thesis on philosophy, titled On the Economy of Thinking, defended at the Jagiellonian University. Moreover, for many years he had been an active participant in the intellectual discourse in one of the finest scientific, artistic and political circles, whose representatives received their education at the universities of Vienna, Paris, Berlin, Heidelberg and Saint Petersburg, and also, by participating in research and lectures, exerted a significant <e2><80><9c>return<e2><80><9d> influence on the shape of knowledge offered by those centers. <c2><a9> Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","PaÅ‚ecki, K",0,10.1007/978-3-319-42025-7_2,326
436,REFLECTIVE BASES OF STUDENTS' COGNITIVE STATES,"The article shows the necessity of studying the reflective bases of cognitive states, shows the significant role of reflection in the regulation of cognitive mental states of students in the course of educational activity. The aim of the study is to identify the role of reflective processes in the mental regulation of students' cognitive states. The study involved 98 people; all of them are students of the Kazan University of different areas of study. The average age of students is 21. In the article used both domestic and foreign techniques, as well as the original author's methodology for diagnosing reflective processes. Among them, the list of 24 cognitive mental states was used. Students had to choose cognitive states that they most often experience in the process of learning activity. Correlation and frequency analysis, as well as analysis of variances method were used. The authors found that most often in the course of educational activity students experience states of interest, concentration, curiosity and inspiration. The development of reflective processes of recognition, awareness and identification, as well as self-reflection, improves the cognitive components of states and contributes to the increase of adequacy, controllability and purposefulness of behaviour in the course of students' learning activities.

438,BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY WORKS ABOUT NOBEL PRIZES AT CATALAN,"Biochemistry and molecular biology are focused on the study of chemical processes which occur inside living cells. Most secondary school students aged between 15 and 17 are not interested in biochemistry because they find the subjects of biochemistry and chemistry difficult to understand. As a consequence, students don't feel motivated enough to study a science degree. However, some of them are interested in biochemistry and molecular biology as seen in TV series such as Forensic Medicine, CSI (Crime Scientific Investigation), Bones, NAVY investigation, etc. In this context, in Catalan secondary school classes, we take advantage of the students' curiosity for TV series to organize new activities about the evolution of biochemistry and molecular biology in the first half of the 20th century by studying the lives of biochemists and their discoveries. Secondary school biology teachers are always trying to find different methods and new forms of work organization to improve the teaching-learning process and they also play an important role when it comes to build positive learning habits. These classroom activities are focused on medicine or physiology and chemistry Nobel Prizes granted during the first half of the 20th century. Some of the scientists included are Santiago Ramon y Cajal, Severo Ochoa, Frederick Sanger, Alexander Fleming, Dorothy Crowfoot or James Watson among others. Students perform their research in a way to answer some questions as: Why has this scientist been selected and which are the most significant discoveries made by him/her that have contributed to the progress of biochemistry and society? The students are given clear guidelines showing the points that are important to focus on in their research and presentation. Furthermore, a poster was made including the Nobel prizes in physiology, medicine and chemistry during the first half of the 20th century, extending this time period until the nineteen sixties when Dr. Severo Ochoa obtained his Nobel Prize. Finally, the entire work was presented to classmates and, last but not least, part of the history of biochemistry has been introduced into the course curriculum to increase students' interest. The main aim of the authors is to encourage school teachers to use Nobel Prize biographies as a didactic and pedagogical tool to increase secondary school student's knowledge in biochemistry and molecular biology","Zaragoza, Carme and Fernandez Novell, Josep M",0,,328

The editors succeed in setting the reader on fire with curiosity and interest in Rorschach himself. They succeed as well in the ambitious task of documenting his life, work, and personality by very carefully investigating the available biographic material. The work and scientific impact of people in contact with Rorschach are also documented by the footnotes. The criteria by which letters were included or omitted remain unclear, though. As the letters are given in a chronological order, information on any one topic is spread throughout the book. As Rorschach writes nothing about the roots and the initial ideas that led him to his test, the interested reader has to turn to his other writings, especially his dissertation on reflex hallucinations. Overall, however, this book puts together quite an amount of information that can broaden and enrich our understanding of the Rorschach for researchers and clinicians alike. Moreover, the correspondence draws the picture of an extraordinary personality. One hopes that it will be promptly translated into English.

442,The psychology of curiosity: A review and reinterpretation,"A differential susceptibility hypothesis proposes that children may differ in the degree to which parenting qualities affect aspects of child development. Infants with difficult temperaments may be more susceptible to the effects of parenting than infants with less difficult temperaments. Using latent change curve analyses to analyze data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care, the current study found that temperament moderated associations between maternal parenting styles during early childhood and children's first-grade academic competence, social skills, and relationships with teachers and peers. Relations between parenting and first-grade outcomes were stronger for difficult than for less difficult infants. Infants with difficult temperaments had better adjustment than less difficult infants when parenting quality was high and poorer adjustment when parenting quality was lower.","Loewenstein, George",0,10.1037/0033-2909.116.1.75,330
443,Motivating native Hawaiians by project-based learning: A narrative inquiry,"Native Hawaiian children have been facing challenges in multiple areas and multiple settings comparing to their non-Hawaiian peers. Many of Native Hawaiian children are academically struggling in the schools and have high dropout rates. This qualitative study explores the perceptions of a group of Native Hawaiian high school graduates on the Island of Oahu in regards to how project-based learning impacted their learning to determine whether or not project-based learning is an effective instructional strategy to motivate Native Hawaiian learners. Project-based learning intergrades the learning and psychological theories of intrinsic motivation, experimental, constructive and social learning. This narrative inquiry study confirmed that project-based learning had positively impacted on most of participants<e2><80><99> learning in the areas of interest of learning, engagement, self- challenged, attitudes towards learning, social and communication skill, learning skills, life skills, Hawaiian culture connection, technology, and curiosity. The importance of teacher-student relationship was identified as a key to achieve a successful PBL. Hands-on projects, community involvement and teamwork were the areas were also considered essential. The implications from this qualitative study were beyond determining whether or not PBL was a motivational tool for Native Hawaiian learners, but some of the causes for lacking of motivation. The participants of this study called for being connected to their cultures, community, place, and school through PBL. The narrative study discovered that Native Hawaiian learners require people who work with them understand Hawaiian culture and establish culture competency in PBL. Successful implementation of PBL can connect Native Hawaiian learners to learning, school, culture, their own identity, and Aloha spirit so that they are motivated to learn.","Hui, Wing Kan Yeung",0,,331

445,Surprise and Curiosity in A Recommender System,"The vast amount of online information today has increased the opportunity to discover interesting and useful information. Various recommender systems have been developed to help people discover such information. No matter how accurately the recommender algorithms perform, users' engagement and satisfaction have been complained being less than ideal. In this study, we touched on two human-centered objectives for recommender systems: surprise and curiosity, both of which are believed to play roles in maintaining user engagement and sustain such engagement in the long run. Specifically, we leveraged the concept of surprise and will incorporate it into a recommender system via two approaches. Knowledge-Based approach, in which we assume that statistical co-occurrence likelihood will help to identify surprising recommendations. And Adaptive Knowledge-Based approach, which aims to improve user satisfaction by adaptively incorporating users' real-time feedback into the recommendations. The insights of the research will make researchers and practitioners rethink the objectives of today's recommender systems or more generally information discovery systems as being more human-centered beyond algorithm accuracy.","Al-Doulat, Ahmad",0,,333

Interviews explored experiences, including their motivations, working processes, challenges, learning and understanding. Roles of scientists in the collaboration ranged from expert advisor to equal creative collaborator. Factors affecting partnerships included curiosity for each other's practice, social interaction and mutual respect. The research suggests that scientists could be motivated to undertake 'Sci-Art' collaborations through personal interest, as well as previously identified motives such as encouragement from their department.

448,A brief scale for measuring Anti-Intellectualism,"This paper describes the development of a brief scale to measure anti-intellectualism, the degree to which one experiences either positive or negative affect while engaged in epistemic activities such as conceptual integration. Using seven samples, the study examined several psychometric components of the measure, including equivalency across community and student/convenience populations, temporal stability, and indications of different forms of validity. The scale was designed to be a brief, reliable and valid measure of individual differences in the degree to which individuals value affect-reinforced need for intellectual engagement. These results suggest that the Anti-Intellectualism Scale may provide a useful tool for the examination of differences in the desire to engage in intellectually challenging activities, and subsequent outcomes such as vocational interest, academic achievement, and democratic citizenship.

449,Cognitive State Measurement on Learning Materials by Utilizing Eye Tracker and Thermal Camera,"We demonstrate how information derived from pervasive sensors can quantify cognitive states of learners while they are reading a textbook. Eye tracking is one of the most effective approaches to measuring reading behavior. For example, high fixation duration represents a reader's attention on a document. However, it is still a challenging task to predict the reason for the attention (i.e., is it because of his/her interest or trouble of understanding?). In this paper, we utilize additional sensing modality to solve the problem. On the dataset of 12 high school students' reading behaviors, we have found that the changing of pupil diameter and nose temperature are highly correlated with their cognitive states including their interests and efforts for reading/solving tasks on learning materials in Physics.","Ishimaru, Shoya and Jacob, Soumy and Roy, Apurba and Bukhari Syed Saqib and and Heisel, Carina and Grossmann, Nicolas and Thees, Michael and Kuhn, Jochen and Dengel, Andreas",0,10.1109/ICDAR.2017.378,337
452,One ingredient in the mix: Interest and psychological well-being,"Whether the focus is infancy, adolescence, early adulthood or old age, through experience individuals accrue schemas that provide the basis for processing of new experience. Such schemas consist of combinations of cognitions and affect organized in ways that reflect the unique experience of each individual. In this chapter I examine the contribution of interest to psychological well-being and assert that interest is an essential ingredient in the dynamic system of experience that contributes to psychological well-being. First, we consider some current understandings of how interest relates to constructs often associated with interest, namely, curiosity and enjoyment. In addition, I consider some of the ways that interest functions in the regulation of specific activities and in the building of schemas that guide behaviour. Against this background, I then examine the role of interest in the virtues and character strengths described in positive psychology as well as the contribution of interest at specific developmental stages: infancy and early childhood, adolescence and adulthood.

453,Marketing decision making and its downstream effects on consumer behavior,"Marketers invest significantly in generating consumer action, with curiosity one of many ways to pique interest. This is the topic of our first essay, in which we discuss how discounted price displays arouse curiosity, thus affecting information search behavior. This essay moves beyond the assumption that any prediscounted price will elicit the same consumer response and considers four moderating factors, including i) absolute price, ii) dispositional curiosity, iii) expected price and iv) drive states such as hunger. In a series of examinations, we propose that higher (lower) prices generate greater (less) curiosity. Findings inform psychology-based accounts of curiosity and provide implications for marketers in understanding pricing's effect on information seeking. Essays 2 and 3 explore the long-term impact of a referral on sender and receiver behavior. Marketers have long sought to harness the influence of existing customers, with much literature focusing on a referral`s worth. While prior research has extensively examined referral value, less is known about how the specific information within the referral itself differentially influences behavior. Thus, Essay 2 focuses on the degree of customization within the referral, examining for both senders and receivers the influence of custom (sender-generated) versus standard (company-generated on behalf of sender) referrals. To test our predictions, we utilize email referrals from retail customers and compare purchase behavior between these referral types, testing the underlying theories of spotlight effect and reciprocity. In our third essay, we ask whether the act of referring changes long term purchase behavior of referrers. Extensive literature has proved the value of customers acquired through referral efforts of existing customers. However, while much is known about the incremental value of referrals, less is known about the intervening role of the referral itself. Therefore, in our research we seek to understand how a referral influences future sender behavior and ask whether the act of referring results in an increase, decrease, or consistency in purchases for senders. We explore opposing predictions based on i) dissonance and ii) market mavens and explore these predictions through an empirical examination of transaction data, offering implications for marketers and theorists alike.

454,A heuristic and hermeneutic inquiry: Ken Wilber and personal transformation (Ken Wilber),"Personal transformation is vital to every sentient being on this planet. Without it the human race and many other living creatures may become extinct. Consciously or not, we all have this need to grow, develop, and evolve. This dissertation explores the theme of transformation in the works of Ken Wilber. The heuristic method incorporated in this work makes use of hermeneutical interpretation to investigate the human experience of growth and development. Through self-search, self-dialogue, and self-discovery, the theme of this research has been brought into the consciousness and life of the researcher, uncovering more meaning in and understanding of personal transformation. Beginning with an intense interest in both the theme of personal transformation and the theories of Ken Wilber, this dissertation makes use of Sandy Sela-Smith's Heuristic Self-Search Inquiry (Sela-Smith, 2001) to understand more deeply and honestly the experience in question. This included months of immersion in the writings and lectures of Wilber and then an incubation period to allow an inner tacit dimension of the experience to develop and come into consciousness. My burning question was-what will my experience be of being immersed in the works of Ken Wilber? Throughout the process there occurred occasions of illumination which helped to provide data and new insights into the experience. This inquiry required reflectiveness on the part of the researcher and a willingness to acknowledge and release any resistance to the ""I-who-feels."" Instead of a focus on the thinking and observing self, the aim is to access the tacit realm of nonverbal thought. The results of this inquiry were numerous. Personal transformation was found to be messy, mysterious, and multi-dimensional. It is not possible to be in control of this process and people can only cooperate with it at best. Personal transformation is an art, not a science; it requires practice and patience, not perseverance and perspiration. It looks more like a dance than a decathlon. At the heart of personal transformation is paradox. I found that transformation occurs more as a result of attitude than action, awareness rather than activity. Surrender and curiosity do more to cultivate transformation than willpower and intelligence. Ultimately, it is life that does the transforming and it is life that creates the experiences that allow us to have a change in consciousness. We are transformed in the act of living.

456,"Conventionalism as a Virtue: A Study of ""Powwow Highway""","Academia has long grappled with the relationship between filmmaking form and content. Film history courses are driven, in part, by aesthetic innovation, and it is not uncommon to study the editing advances made by D. W. Griffith and the silent-era Soviet filmmakers, the exploration of deep focus photography by Orson Welles and Gregg Toland, the shift to location shooting by the Italian neorealists, the implementation of jump cuts and freeze frames by the French New Wave, and the long-take sensibility of experimental filmmaker Michael Snow. The interest in formal innovation is complemented by skepticism toward conventional Hollywood form. The 1989 independent film ""Powwow Highway"" uses the most conventional Hollywood narrative structure of all while carrying content that is highly unconventional in nature: drawing on Cheyenne history and cultural traditions that are slowly being forgotten, the film argues that people live by the wrong values. In packaging oppositional content with conventional and accessible Hollywood form, the movie connects with a wide range of students, sparking an emotional response and an intellectual curiosity (fueled, seemingly, by that emotional engagement). At eighty-seven minutes, it is also remarkably flexible, fitting perfectly into an hour and a half class session and capable of inspiring productive discussion in four different arenas: (1) courses centering on Native American culture; (2) race, class, and gender courses; (3) film and literature classes within literary studies; and (4) screenwriting. For educators seeking to bridge theory and practice by offering students the option to write a script or produce a production in lieu of a research paper, ""Powwow Highway"" offers a helpful template. This article explores how dramatic structure is used in ""Powwow Highway"" and how this structure accommodates unconventional, personal content. Through understanding the relationship between form and content, this article seeks to inspire the creation of further work that generates curiosity, reflection, and commitment to cultural and social issues outside the experience of the mainstream viewer.

In reference to the phenomenon, this chapter discusses cross-national attraction, policy borrowing, the effect of Finland in PISA, and its influence on education policy. This chapter explores at length the theoretical background of cross-national attraction and policy borrowing, also investigating cases that have already occurred. It discusses Finland's role as the new object of cross-national attraction and eventual policy borrowing. The chapter incorporates research into the reasons for Finland's success in PISA, the possibilities of policy transfer from Finland, and delves into the likelihood of policy implications as a result of Finland in PISA. This cross-national attraction denotes the first stage in policy borrowing; however, comparative educationalists, for years, have warned about the uncritical transfer of education policy. Research in Finland has revealed many reasons for the country's PISA success stem from contextual factors: those related to historical, cultural, societal, and political features of Finland. Therefore, policy borrowing from Finland needs to heed warnings of past comparativists. The new phenomenon of Finland in PISA has generated much curiosity from those in education, educational policy, and politics. Policymakers are keen to incorporate Finland's educational features into their education systems. PISA and Finland's performance in the survey influence educational policy. This illustrates the importance the warnings of past and present comparative educationalists in order to prevent uncritical policy borrowing.","Chung, J H",0,10.1108/S1479-3679(2010)0000013013,342

The address criticizes the current educational system for its concentration on college preparatory courses that have little or no hands-on experience. It argues that the existing system does not encourage curiosity, a problem seen as so pervasive that it needs to be examined from a vertical integration or systems engineering point of view. Increasing interest in the area of science and technology education has recently been evidenced by several professional groups, which may lead to such an examination. Reactions of two discussants are appended. Frances Degen Horowitz highlights the need for a national policy which commits sufficient resources to develop the talents of children, and a policy which overrides some local, community control issues. William Anlyan notes the importance of looking to the free enterprise system in addition to government for help with the problem of developing academic talent, comments on the growing laziness of the United States as a nation, and supports the recognition of nontraditional forms of talent.

It provides tips for successful implementation of learner-centered learning using educational robotics learning tool. The chapter explains how teachers can use educational technology with a learnercentered approach, using examples from 4th grade robotics unit as part of the science curriculum. Preschool teachers commonly use learner-centered approach that build upon students' interests, curiosities and inquiries. Somehow, the practice shifts gradually into teacher-centered pedagogy once students start to transition into upper grades. Providing a learner-centered learning environment promotes students' ability to build independent, active learner skills throughout their school experience, benefiting and enhancing their educational experience in post-secondary education and beyond. Educational robotics is a powerful learning tool that enables teachers to create learner-centered learning environments for students and promote learner-centered pedagogy in schools. <c2><a9> 2017, IGI Global.","Eguchi, A",0,10.4018/978-1-5225-0892-2.ch019,344

467,Review of Masculinidades subordinadas: Investigaciones hacia las transformaciones del genero,"Reviews the book, Masculinidades Subordinadas: Investigaciones Hacia las Transformaciones del Genero by Jose Toro-Alfonso (2008). One of the areas of research that has recently developed within the field of gender studies is the study of the social construction of masculinity, that is, the ways in which men involve themselves in complex symbolic processes linked to gender imperatives that theoreticians have called 'hegemonic masculinities'. This body of research has filled some theoretical voids and contributed to feminist theory in the critique of heteronormativity, by pointing out areas of silence, opacity and fracture within such an ideological system. Written from a psycho-social perspective, this book explores the vulnerability of certain sex-gender practices and configurations that depart from the hegemonic masculine canon in the Dominican Republic. The author explores issues of representation, homosexuality, sex work and health, like HIV and eating disorders. The essay is well written and easy to read; it provides innovative information within the area of study, makes appropriate use of theory and includes a wide range of references. However, hardly any stories of bulimic or anorexic men or of abused, disenfranchised homosexual men and other subjective complexities are included. This is not morbid curiosity, but an interest based on the fact that the subjects studied are presented to us as somewhat impersonal figures, maybe reducing the potential impact of the text on readers' ideas and incidence on public policy. This way, the author hides from the reader a whole universe of testimonies that he leaves off stage, choosing instead to adopt a more quantitative perspective.

By laying the theoretical foundation, a conceptual framework for technology-enabled active learning was developed. The conceptual framework formed the basis of the instrument development process including the design, development and validation of TEAL to measure students' perceptions of active learning in a technology-enabled learning context. The self-reporting questionnaire consisted of four scales: interactive engagement, problem-solving skills, interest and feedback. All scales were assessed on a 7-point Likert scale. The survey items were designed to measure the four aspects of technology-enabled active learning and were verified by two panels using a formalised card sorting procedure as well as confirmatory factor analysis of a small-scale (n = 61) pilot survey. The TEAL questionnaire demonstrated internal consistency. Reliability as measured by Cronbach's coefficient alpha ranged from 0.83 to 0.88 indicating good reliability and internal consistency of the items. The resultant instrument is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used in future research to gather and represent data on students' perceptions of active learning in a technology-enabled learning context.","Shroff, Ronnie Homi and Ting, Fridolin Sze Thou and Lam, Wai Hung",0,10.14742/ajet.4472,351

475,A Psychoanalytic Study of Manic Depressive Psychosis,"Determines whether psychoanalysis can be successfully applied to severe cases of manic depressive psychosis, and traces the symptoms of the psychosis to phases of character development and specific crises in the lives of the patients. Five cases were studied in detail as to symptomatology, history, and psychoanalytic treatment. The therapeutic results are doubtful, but suggest the importance of further application of the method. The personal histories obtained through psychoanalysis revealed some points of interest. Four of the five cases reached puberty at an unusually early age, and all of them developed sex repressions as a result of their mothers' failure to meet their needs at the critical time. Curiosity, doubt, and fear as to sexual problems arose early and were inadequately met by incomplete knowledge gained in a clandestine manner. Excessive bashfulness, lack of self-confidence, modesty, prudery, and incipient homosexuality were the results. In married life the patients were maladjusted. The wish-fulfilling nature of many of the delusions and irrational actions of the patients was apparent. This psychosis can be differentiated from dementia praecox , as here the contact with reality is never broken, and the character is extroverted while the dementia precox character is introverted. The ""Flight into Reality"" of the manic attack is a defense reaction by which the patient is protected from the painful thought of his own fundamental inferiority. In the depressive attack the defense is no longer possible, and the patient is weighted down with the pain of acknowledged defect. The difficulty of psychoanalysis is due to the method of defense in the manic phase and to listlessness and inaccessibility in the depressive phase. From Psych Bulletin 18:05:00262.

477,"CREATIVITY, TEAMWORK AND PROBLEM SOLVING IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS","The unemployment crisis is a major problem in many countries, and particularly in Spain. Nevertheless, for a long time now the managerial sector has been showing great difficulties to find university graduates that meet their talent demands, since the new wave of professionals has shortcomings in what is known as soft skills or social skills. Social skills are a combination of problemsolving, teamwork, leadership, creativity and empathy skills, which are essential tools for graduates wishing to integrate successfully into the current labour market. Despite the fact that these abilities should be trained and encouraged from pre-university stages, the reality is that they are under-represented in most secondary education curricula. This paper describes the first approach to studying the relation between proficiency in different kinds of soft skills among high school students, and the type of university education choices they make. To this end, we analysed the extent to which a sample of high school students from seven secondary education centres in the Region of Madrid mastered creativity, teamwork and problem solving skills. The method used to assess said skills is based on statistical analysis of student responses to specific questionnaires. On-line and in-class psychometric tests from eCompetentis project have been used (after validation in Spanish) to appraise the students' ability to work as part of a team and solve problems. For creativity, we used TestMyCreativity, an on-line, open-access test developed by a team of company recruiters. The main results suggest that high school students are good at teamwork, have average-to-high problem-solving skills, and relatively high creativity. There are small differences between students depending on the major they choose to take in their pre-university studies. For instance, it seems like those who choose technology-related majors are the least creative, and their curiosity and abstraction levels are significantly lower than among other students. At the same time, they are slightly better team players, and excellent when it comes to planning. These students are usually not very good at problem solving, and are more impulsive than those who pick other specialities. Social sciences students are more creative and better at problem solving, while humanities students are just the opposite. Upon first data examination, it appeared that acquisition of these skills in different ways is what determines the existence of several profiles; however, said profiles do not exactly correspond to the type of major chosen by students. It would therefore be very interesting to increase our study sample and expand our research into more diverse and numerous groups of high school students.","Garcia-Garcia, M J and Grande-Ortiz, M A and Gonzalez-Garcia, C and Rodriguez-Malo, P",0,,355
478,The Values in Action (VIA) Classification of Strengths,"The fledgling field of positive psychology calls for as much focus on strength as on weakness, as much interest in building the best things in life as in repairing the worst, and as much concern with fulfilling the lives of healthy people as healing the wounds of the distressed. The past concern of psychology with human problems is of course understandable and will not be abandoned any time in the foreseeable future, but psychologists interested in promoting human potential need to pose different questions from their predecessors who assumed a disease model. For the past several years, positive psychologists have focused their attention on positive traits--strengths of character, such as curiosity, kindness, and hope. What are the most important of these, and how can they be measured as individual differences? So long as psychologists fail to identify the specifics, different groups will simply talk past one another when attempting to address the issue of character. For instance, is character defined by what someone does not do, or is there a more active meaning? Is character a singular characteristic of an individual, or is it composed of different aspects? Is character socially constructed and laden with idiosyncratic values, or are there universals suggesting a more enduring basis? Does character exist in degrees, or is it just something that one happens to have or not? The groundwork that will allow these questions to be answered has been laid out in this chapter. The Values in Action (VIA) Classification of Strengths project means to complement the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of the American Psychiatric Association by focusing on what is right about people and specifically about the strengths of character that make the good life possible. The VIA classification is the first major project deliberately developed from the perspective of positive psychology.

In its section Science in Society, FP7 funds projects aimed at promoting scientific education, curiosity of the young towards science and the advance of scientific culture with the public. Great importance is given to the contribution that comes from studies of the history, sociology and philosophy of science with projects aimed at the improvement of teaching methodology of scientific disciplines, in order to promote young people<e2><80><99>s interest in science and technology with a positive outlook on science and scientific careers. In this chapter, we illustrate the current situation of European policies concerning the relationship between science education and the history and philosophy of science (HPS) at the level of the central EU institutions, as well as in each nation with particular reference to Italy. Moreover, we provide an overview - in several European countries - of the concrete experiences of attempting to incorporate HPS in science curricula. <c2><a9> Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","Dibattista, L and Morgese, F",0,10.1007/978-94-007-7654-8_64,357

Although these courses can effectively integrate the sciences in ways that stimulate student curiosity and interest, they have not yet received formal recognition for the role they could play in improving science education for secondary students. In this article, the authors discuss why ocean science courses are not as prevalent in high schools and, by contrast, why ocean science courses should be taught. Finally, the authors present a framework and suggested resources to show teachers how they can align ocean science concepts to the national standards and become more experienced in strategies for teaching these concepts.

481,"A curiosity in the history of sciences: The words ""megrim"" and ""migraine""","Vertigo has been described by medical doctors since Antiquity, but the condition is not limited to human medicine. It is also interesting to note that vertigo-related disorders were long only mentioned in the descriptions of migraine: however, in the Corpus Hippocraticum, a pain with vertigo (odune kai skotodinie) was not considered as hemicrania; in Aretaeus medical text, scotoma was clearly another disease than heterocranie; although there could be metastases between them (pain could be followed by vertigo, as Boerhaave translated from Greek to Latin); Caelius Aurelianus, Ibn Zuhr of Seville, Isma'il Jurjani considered vertigo as a separate entity from ""migraine"" as well. One had to wait until 1831 for ""ophthalmic migraine"" (Piorry) to take systematically this disorder into account (to more or less causally relate it to migraine), and 1988 for the International Headache Society to acknowledge vertigo as a symptom of aura in ""basilar migraine,"" which was given the better name of basilar-type migraine in 2004. From this point of view, veterinary medicine presents a particular interest because, for centuries, diseases mainly affecting horses-called in French ""migraine,"" ""mal de tete"" (headache), ""douleur de tete"" (head pain), or in English ""megrim(s),"" ""head-ach,"" ""pain,"" and for which it is not self-evident that they are in any way related with the conditions that bear these names in humans-have been connected with vestibular impairments. Whatever is the relationship between the human and animal pathologies and, although it is impossible to interpret animal signs (abnormal behavior) with human symptoms (complaints), some impressive descriptions, written by Anglo-Saxon authors for the most part, seem to have played a significant role in the history of migraine. The purpose is to examine how a word in its English veterinary medical sense could have influenced French medical descriptions.

In addition, the lower the children's self-esteem, the lower their preference for challenge. Additional analyses indicated that (a) self-evaluations of scholastic competence mediated the effects of both stability and level of self-esteem and (b) day-to-day variability in self-evaluations of scholastic competence was so intertwined with stability of self-esteem that neither uniquely predicted either curiosity/interest or preference for challenge. Finally, the more unstable the children's self-esteem, the greater the likelihood that they reported that they would become angry because of the self-esteem-threatening aspects of aversive interpersonal events.

485,Voyages of Discovery: Experiencing the Emotion of History,"Guiding students through a dramatic exploration of an historical event can elicit strong emotional reactions that can deepen student understanding and interest in the subject matter. This article describes an integrated third grade lesson plan that focuses on Henry Hudson's voyages in the early 1600s. The students take on the roles of Hudson's sailors, and experience the cold, loneliness, frustration, and disorientation of Hudson's last voyage. An integrated drama/history activity such as this builds on children's natural curiosity, avid imaginations, and love of good stories. Role-playing an historical event engages all of these affinities simultaneously. Through a series of imagined experiences based on historical realities, the students thoroughly explore the sequence of events. They emotionally invest in the characters and their destinies. When young students feel a sense of ownership over the event, they are generally more interested in learning about the details of the event. Ultimately, they develop a deeper understanding of the historical event because they have formed an emotional tie with the characters and their situation. A list of children's books and background material for teachers is included. (Contains 4 endnotes.)","Kelin  II, Daniel A",0,,361
486,The effect of inquiry-based explorations in a dynamic geometry environment on sixth grade students' achievements in polygons,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of using a dynamic geometry environment (DGE) together with inquiry-based explorations on the sixth grade students' achievements in polygons and congruency and similarity of polygons. Two groups of sixth grade students were selected for this study: an experimental group composed of 66 students (34 boys and 32 girls); and a control group composed of 68 students (35 boys and 33 girls). The students in the experimental group taught with a DGE, while the students in the control group received textbook-based direct instruction. An achievement test was administered as pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test in both groups. Qualitative data were collected through videotaped classroom observations. The results showed that the DGE together with open-ended explorations significantly improved students' performances in polygons and congruency and similarity of polygons. Furthermore, students in the experimental group showed greater interest and motivation toward learning geometry compared to those in the control group whom often showed lack of interest and curiosity. Also, students' comments and interpretations during lessons and tests were more accurate and advanced in the experimental group as they engage more in the DGE. Moreover, qualitative data suggested that boys showed greater interest in the computer-based learning environment than girls in the experimental groups although no significant gender effect on achievement was found.

487,Outside the box: Epistemic curiosity as a predictor of creative problem solving and creative performance,"Anecdotal evidence suggests that curiosity contributes to creative performance. However, empirical work linking curiosity to creativity is surprisingly lacking. To fill this gap, this study examines the effect of trait epistemic curiosity on the creative problem solving process. Participants (N = 122) responded to questionnaires assessing trait curiosity before performing in a low-fidelity simulation in which they were tasked with solving a complex marketing problem. The quality and originality of the creative solutions were then rated by three independent coders. Results revealed that diversive curiosity (i.e., epistemic curiosity associated with interest factors) had a positive influence on creative performance<e2><80><94>an effect that was fully mediated by information seeking behavior during early-stage creative problem solving. Furthermore, diversive curiosity positively predicted ratings of both solution quality and originality beyond established predictors of creative performance (gender, personality, domain expertise, and GMA) and constructs conceptually similar to curiosity (epistemic openness to experience, need for cognition, and typical intellectual engagement). Specific curiosity (i.e., curiosity associated with deprivation factors) was unrelated to both creative problem solving and creative performance. Implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed. <c2><a9> 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Hardy, Jay H I I I and Ness, Alisha M and Mecca, Jensen and Hardy  III, J H and Ness, Alisha M and Mecca, Jensen and III, J H Hardy and Ness, Alisha M and Mecca, Jensen",0,10.1016/j.paid.2016.08.004,363

This evaluation model aims to measure the performance of teachers in accordance with predetermined standards or performance criteria. Assessment of teachers' performance was done by multi-assessors. The goal of this study is to identify the teacher's performance in conducting the learning process based on group age.

He roamed around knocking things over, prying inside or underneath things, paying no heed to his teachers. At the first restraining order he bellowed so loudly he could be heard in the next county. He was so high-strung and nervous that I felt he should have some rest in the middle of the morning, for our sake if not his own. In his four years of life Randall had never learned repose while awake. He had to be taught how to fie quietly with his eyes closed. He showed no interest in the other children, and his lack of concentration made the teachers think he was retarded. It seemed to me, however, that he was just a very undisciplined little boy with an amazing curiosity.

493,"Are creative people tough-minded, curious or kind?","Hans Eysenck (1993) proposes that creativity correlates with the personality construct of Psychoticism (P) in populations with high intelligence. However, this theory has only, at best, received mixed support, and recently Reuter et al. (2005) found that a biologically-based construct (SEEK), related to curiosity and problem solving, was instead related to creativity rather the P. The present study explored the relationship between personality and creativity further by using a multifaceted assessment approach to creativity, which included a self-report creativity instrument, a convergent thinking measure, and figural and verbal divergent thinking measures, across a population of 75 'non-artistic' degree university students (Non-Art) and 26 College of Fine Arts students (Art). No evidence for Eysenck's (1993) psychoticism-creativity link was found when comparing the groups, whereas the SEEK construct correlated with self-reported creativity. Of particular interest were the findings for participants without English as their first language, where the SEEK construct positively correlated with both divergent thinking and self-reported creativity. Additionally, a personality construct related to 'caring' was unexpectedly the strongest correlate of creativity.

Social curiosity has been conceptualized as an interest in how other people behave, think, and feel. Students (N = 916) at 3 general universities in Henan Province completed the Chinese version of the SCS. The results showed that the Chinese SCS has good internal consistency reliability. Exploratory factor analysis results indicated that the Chinese SCS presented a clear 2-factor structure, and confirmatory factor analysis results showed that the 2-factor model fitted the data better than the 1-factor model did. These results indicated that the Chinese version of the SCS has good construct validity. Therefore, the Chinese version of the SCS can be used as an effective tool for social curiosity measurement among Chinese university students.","Zhang, Yong",0,10.2224/sbp.8263,370
496,History of giftedness: Perspectives from the past presage modern scholarship,"Part of this chapter is a revision of an article published in the Annual Review of Psychology (Robinson & Clinkenbeard, 1998). We thank Annual Reviews Inc. for permission to adapt that material. Across centuries and cultures, exceptional performances and performers have intrigued scholars, practitioners, and the general public. Whatever the domain, high-level achievements interest people, sometimes as a model to emulate, sometimes as an area of inquiry, sometimes as a curiosity. Theoretically, the modern study of giftedness is related to the psychology of individual differences. In the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries, the psychological constructs of intelligence, creativity, and motivation provided the foundation for understanding giftedness. There are, however, earlier conceptions of extraordinary people and performances that have influenced our perspectives on giftedness as well. This chapter reviews briefly the historical interest in giftedness to the nineteenth century, shares four biographical summaries that illustrate key issues in the twentieth-century history of gifted education, offers a review of cognitive and affective variables which have historically been used to study giftedness, and concludes with attention to issues of particular interest to psychologists and mental health professionals.

497,SHOW ME WHAT YOU KNOW Creating Classroom Projects,"Early childhood teachers promote literacy learning through intentional instructional practices and the establishment of classroom environments that encourage and support the work, interest, and curiosity of young learners. They provide opportunities for children to engage with their teacher and peers and consider this an important component of literacy learning. Moreover, teachers design visually pleasing environments that support students' prior knowledge and experiences. The project approach to learning integrates all of the basic elements of literacy learning while respecting the natural inquisitive nature of children and their need to construct their own learning as they interact within their classroom environment, peers, and teachers. In this article, we share a snapshot of how one kindergarten teacher incorporated elements of the project approach within her classroom in the hopes that other teachers will feel inspired to try aspects of this method of teaching in their own classrooms.","Young, Teresa and Morgan, Ashley",0,10.1002/trtr.1330,372
498,Selecting educational content for young children,"The readiness of young children for challenging intellectual experiences was evident throughout the study. The young children were eager to gather information to apply in their conversations and their play situations. They were attempting to see relationships, to make generalizations, to discriminate, to classify. They were curious and concerned about the daily occurrences of group living, about friendship and family, neighbor and neighborhood. They were interested in the faraway in time and in space. There was an interest in causality as well as concern and sometimes confusion in distinguishing between naturalistic and magical explanations for various phenomena. The children were observing the scientific world around them with much curiosity. They were actively using concepts of quantity, of size, of space, of number. These children were using words beautifully, metaphorically, humorously and nonsensically. They were struggling to communicate with others and trying to learn to hear and understand what others were saying to them. Young children may not see or understand reality in the same way that a more experienced adult might, and they may not respond to ""teaching"" in the same way that an adult might. The key concepts in any subject field are best defined by the specialists in that field. It is the role of those responsible for curriculum development to translate these concepts into appropriate experiences for children. Much work must be done by specialists in many of the subject matter areas to delineate the key ideas of their field so they can be effectively used by curriculum workers. Most of the standard texts in the fields at all levels present factual information without reference to the key concepts. In certain fields work is more advanced in this direction than in others. In mathematics and certain branches of science it is possible to point to definitive materials on the fundamental structure of the fields. In other areas this is not possible. Thus, for the purposes of this study it is not possible to point to well developed delineations of key concepts which can serve as the basis for choosing content for young children. But this approach to selection of content is so promising that steps must be taken now in spite of the limited help available. Consequently, some of the basic concepts which this study suggests might serve as criteria for choosing content for young children will be identified in the following pages. Previous chapters have presented findings which might be classified as children's understandings in social science, science, and language. Here we will recall where we found children in their understanding of each of these areas and suggest ways by which their understanding can be advanced and related to key ideas in each of the fields of knowledge. Before moving into the separate areas, however, we must look briefly at the children's reasoning and logic and the part they will play in concept formation.

The reporting theme supports a developmentally appropriate learning arena by implementing a range of inter-curricular instruction that embraces authentic learning experiences. This approach follows the child's interests and gives the child the tools to take ownership of his/her own learning. Parallel learning opportunities for developing the research process and the skill of reporting establishes a purpose for seeking, documenting, comparing and analyzing information. The children's experience improves communication skills using purposeful ""reporting"" opportunities that encourage diversified instruction using oral, written and aesthetic methods as a means for sharing information. Oral reporting evolves into written documentation of discoveries using a myriad of reporting strategies. The purpose of writing becomes meaningful and deepens the understanding of the value of writing as a method for sharing information.

500,Everyday personal informatics,"The increase in ubiquity of personal tracking tools has resulted in more people tracking their actions and behaviors, bringing more varied expertise and more diverse goals to the process. Although this increase in access provides great opportunity for more people to benefit from self monitoring, tracking tools often fail to acknowledge and account for the realities of what it means for this more diverse group to use track in their everyday life. My dissertation provides evidence that accounting for the challenges of everyday life can help people find more value in their data and find more support through their data. Toward helping people find value in their data, I first describe the Lived Informatics Model, a new conceptual model which describes people's use of tracking technology in everyday life. In addition to behavior change, people are also motivated to track out of goals of curiosity and a desire to have a record. I suggest that collecting data and acting on it is part of a larger process of deciding to track, selecting a tool, and lapsing in tracking. I also surface that people desire additional insight from their data while they are tracking, which motivates the design of the Visual Cuts system. Through Visual Cuts, I demonstrate that surfacing correlations between aspects of multi-dimensional tracked data to better help people understand their habits and identify ways they can improve them. Examining how designs can better help people find support through their data, I describe the Design Framework for Sharing, distilling the body of research on sharing tracked data to six dimensions key to creating positive sharing experiences. I analyze and vary Tweets generated by the RunKeeper app to understand how one of these dimensions, post content, can be improved. I show that posts receive more response and interest when they explain a moment's importance to the audience, which motivates the design of the Yarn app. Through the design and evaluation of Yarn, I demonstrate that a structured experience for authoring content can help people create posts from their tracked data which explain a moment's importance. Across these projects, I argue that the common approaches in today's tracking tools for summarizing and presenting data do not provide the benefits promised and the sharing mechanisms do not help people get advice and encouragement they desire. I suggest that accounting for the varied reasons why people track and designing for varied levels of expertise results in designs which better help people understand their habits and get support from others.

501,"Piquing Student Curiosity with Title Pages from Works by Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau","Long before public libraries, online bookstores that ship directly to our homes, technologies that enable the downloading of publications directly to mobile devices, and social networks supporting virtual book clubs, eighteenth-century book readers relied heavily on literary societies, subscription libraries, and the advice of and selections made by colonial booksellers whose relationships with publishers--most of whom were in Europe-- fostered the exchange of ideas. The books they read varied from fiction to non-fiction titles, and from essays to multi-volume series. They dealt with wide-ranging subjects, including political philosophy. Title pages from such publications of the Enlightenment provide engaging points of entry for student research into the origins of ideas contained in the Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights.

It is suggested that he related to the uncivilized realities of the outer world and may have forced him to confront paingul preoccupations of his own inner world.

The best solution appears to be to take two directions: on the one hand, strengthening of the professional standard can bring renewal by transferring to the museum types of buildings or installations that have a curiosity value arousing the public's interest (brandy distillery, soda-water plant, photographic studio, etc.), and on the other hand, strengthening our educational efforts, providing attractions for the public. We had thought that with the implementation of our building transfer plan the construction of the museum village could be regarded as completed, but we found that this was a mistake: there is no such thing as a completed museum, we are constantly faced with new challenges and we can only meet the expectations of the public by strengthening education and entertainment, expanding themes and complex services, and it is only in this way that we can provide a greater feeling of comfort for visitors. But in achieving this we must take care to avoid the danger of commercialisation and the ""Disneyland"" effect.

506,Curious about curiosity?,"Reviews the book, Why? What Makes Us Curious by Mario Livio (see record 2017-26474-000). The subject of Why? is curiosity, broadly construed as a fundamental aspect of human mental life, which places it firmly in the psychological realm. Although he is not a psychologist, Livio has harnessed a range of other skills and personal experiences in gathering and presenting the material for this engaging book. These include a rigorous and productive scientific background (he is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and author of some 400 scientific articles), varied personal interests (he is an art lover and science advisor for the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra), and a long history of popular writing and lecturing about the connections between art and science.

511,Identifying True Normality in the Elementary Child,"Kay Baker offers a look at the needs and manifestations (observed characteristics) of the developing human being, specifically of the second-plane child. She outlines key ideas in thinking about these needs and manifestations and discerns the pedagogy associated with each. She emphasizes that the pedagogy/practice must meet the needs of the child. She discusses the tools available to the adult in assessing their own practice: First, there is observation to inform; and second, the four planes of development and fundamental needs of the human being provide a framework. As it is the child's work to construct himself through activity, it is the adult's work to awaken the interest in the child that impels him to work: ""What can hook the child and result in action?"" What will inspire the feeling of interest and curiosity to fuel continued work? Her conclusion is beautifully simple yet deeply profound in that it is the goal toward which the practitioner constantly strives.

512,Teaching Density with a Little Drama,"This article provides an example of an innovative science activity applied in a science methods course for future elementary teachers at a small university in northeastern Turkey. The aim of the activity is to help prospective elementary teachers understand the density concept in a simple way and see an innovative teaching example. The instructor described the mechanisms underlined in density by arousing the curiosity of the students (by giving an attractive title), by sustaining their interest throughout the topic (by relating to real-life activity), and by using simple language (appropriate to their level of understanding). The way of explaining the density used in this article could also be used in science teacher education, high school science classes, and maybe even in junior high and elementary schools. Many science educators recommend connecting hard-to-understand science concepts to real-life experiences. And in this article the instructor tried to implement an innovative science lesson by connecting the density concept to real-life experiences (to acting in a play).","Karakas, Mehmet",0,,383

This course should motivate freshmen for a further study of engineering in general and should spur interest in electrical and computer engineering in particular. The philosophy is that hands-on laboratory and experiences build student confidence, stimulate curiosity, and demonstrate the relevance of electrical engineering. The practical experiments are supported by traditional lectures in combination with other learning methods. Further, a variety of formative and summative evaluation methods are used.

514,INTANGIBLE FACTORS OF EDUCATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND THE CONCEPT OF,"The idea of sustainability originates from ecologically oriented analysis of reality, but it ceased to be exclusively the idea of the environment and become a relevant topic for all spheres, including the education. Education is a sensitive field where emotional incompatibility, social statuses and different economic interests collide, producing different effects. Higher education institutions and the factors affecting their sustainable development represent the research subjects of this paper. On the one hand, there are tangible elements of educational sustainability (such as the available physical resources of the campus, the structure and content of the curriculum, the achieved level of development of communication with certain categories of actors), while on the other side, there are intangible elements that are often neglected in the analysis of educational efficiency, because they are not so obvious and are difficult to measure. The focus of this paper is precisely on this low-structured, so-called `soft' (intangible) elements of the educational process that affect the sustainability of higher education, as well as on finding a standardized system of metrics and measures for monitoring the impact of certain factors on sustainability ie. educational efficiency. The aim of this paper is to highlight the key intangible parameters that affect educational performance. Through the relevant literature review, authors made a selection of battery of tests that measure the intangible elements of educational efficiency (such as the emotions of curiosity, optimism, caring, personal efficiency, personality traits, boredom and other socio-psychological factors). Emotions are an inevitable and powerful part of life and learning, especially during adolescence, which is a very important period in terms of emotional development, which explains the unstable behavior in this age. There are studies that prove that negative emotions block learning, and emotional conditions caused by fear or stress, for example, directly affect learning and memory. Therefore, the pilot survey was conducted by using a combination of identified and selected tests, and the research sample was consisted from the students of the University of Novi Sad, Serbia. The research results are summarized in the proposed theoretical model for evaluating the sustainability of higher education institutions, in which emotions are having a key role. This paper proposes a list of key intangible factors of educational efficiency. According to the fact that emotions either encourage or disturb the processes such as the ability to pay attention, problem solving and maintaining social connections, they can be a powerful stimulus or barrier to learning. If a person is emotionally unstable and/or immature, he or she is less efficient in the utilization of their intellectual potential. The proposed model in this paper should provide a set of standardized measurement of the intangible factors' impact, which affects the sustainability of higher education institutions (together with the known tangible factors, of course), thus creating the basis for higher education institutions ranking in terms of sustainability. Furthermore, the application of the proposed model among the higher education institutions will enable the creation of concrete actions to reduce identified barriers to learning, which are crucial for raising the level of educational efficiency and sustainability.","Nikolic, Slavka T and Stankovic, Jelena and Tumbas, Pere and Matkovic, Predrag",0,,385
516,Response to Novelty: Continuity Versus Discontinuity in the Developmental Course of Intelligence,"This chapter examines the evidence for regarding intelligence as, in part, deriving from one's response to novelty. It reviews research and theorizing in diverse domains, such as infant visual information processing, infant recognition memory, selected aspects of infant temperament (task persistence and attention span), psychometric intelligence, Piagetian intelligence, and cognitive psychology, in order to demonstrate the idea that one's response to novel tasks and situations is intimately involved in the construct of intelligence. An organizing framework for conceptualizing intelligence as, in part, a response to novelty is provided. This framework comprises two major aspects: a motivational aspect, according to which a person's interest in, curiosity about, and preference for novelty are involved in intelligent functioning; and an information-extraction aspect, which involves identification of those component processes that are involved in the acquisition of novel information. The chapter argues that viewing intelligence as involving a person's response to novelty, of a variety of kinds, may provide theorists a means for understanding at least one source of continuity in the nature of intelligence across the life span. In turn, this continuity may suggest a relatively stable source of individual differences in intellectual development. <c2><a9> 1985, Elsevier Inc.

519,Children want to know about the phenomena that surround them,"It is an accepted fact of child development that young children are intensely interested and curious about the world of people and things which touch them every day. One has only to walk with a young child along a garden path or down a busy street to have this fact dramatically underscored. Everything from the tiniest bug to the largest steam shovel intrigues him. He must look, touch, smell, and, as often as not, taste in his zeal to satisfy his curiosity, to understand what things are and why they are. It is precisely this last point which the present study underlines. It was not necessary to study children over a long period to learn of their interest in things about them. Our concern was with the purposes of their interest and exploration-what it was they wanted to know about the phenomena in their environment. How do young children view and interpret their environment? The belief that they are not capable of critically interpreting the world around them-that they are essentially egocentric and animistic in their interpretation of their environment- has been a limiting concept. The present study supports these ideas. Young children today are highly motivated to explore, to test the accuracy of their observations of the things and events in their environment. Some animism and reliance on magical explanations were evident, but the cases in which children pushed for real explanations far outnumber the cases of animism and magic.

Based on socioemotional selectivity theory, a lifespan approach to expectancy theory, and research on interest and workplace curiosity, two views on motivational change over the trajectory of a working life were evaluated: the view of age-related motivational decline and the view of age-related motivational maintenance. Results showed a main effect of age on motivation to learn (beta=.44) and a moderating effect of age (beta=.59) on the relation between motivation to learn and transfer of training (rho = 0.33). Both effects were in the positive direction, indicating support for the view of age-related motivational maintenance.

521,A SCIENCE FICTION SERIOUS GAME FOR LEARNING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES,"The paper presents a serious game, implemented as a software application, aimed towards beginner programmers with the purpose of teaching programming languages fundamentals. The application is a top-down 2D game combining elements from the shooter and strategy ( particularly tower defence) genres, with high-level visual programming elements, giving it an educational component. The user creates the scripts in a visual manner, creating the flow of scripting elements then programming each element. Serious games are games which are designed and developed without having entertainment as their main purpose. Instead, their primary purpose is to educate, train, or inform their audience. The meaning of the term has evolved in the last few years and currently it is usually assumed that serious games are video games, rather than physical, non-digital games. Digital game-based learning is a subset of serious games having as a main purpose to educate the player through the use of video games. Video games manage to keep the players interested, even if they find themselves in challenging situations, and this is on account of the intrinsic motivation they achieve to maintain on the players. What makes learning an intrinsically motivating process is similar to what makes a video game intrinsically motivating, this being challenge, curiosity, fantasy and control. Contextualization, personalization, and choice improve the intrinsic motivation of a learner, thus increasing their degree of engagement in the learning process and ameliorating their learning performance. These three properties are often present in most video games. This compatibility between video games and learning makes integrating the one to the other an easier accomplishment. While some other serious games aimed at programming exist, such as RoboCode, CodeCombat, Kernel Panic, CoLoBoT, CeeBot, CodeSpells, there is still much room for innovation, and our application explores new features and modes of play, focusing more on the program structure and logic than on the syntax.","Vasilateanu, Andrei and Wyrazic, Sebastian and Pavaloiu, Bujor",0,10.12753/2066-026X-16-082,391
522,The motivational and information needs of young innovators: Stimulating student creativity and inventive thinking,"Innovation is the essence of the American spirit. In the twenty-first century, it will be the innovative thinkers who will make the greatest contributions to our society, find cures for diseases, create technologies that enrich our lives, and find innovative solutions to the world's problems. Schools must provide more opportunities for students to create, innovate, and explore their ideas; the school library is the one place in the school in which all children can think outside the box, seeking solutions to real-world problems that interest and challenge them. This article describes a study conducted by a research team at Syracuse University's Center for Digital Literacy, in collaboration with the Connecticut Invention Convention, investigating the attitudes toward innovation activities, motivational supports, and information needs of young innovators in grade 4-8 as they progressed through the innovation process. Implications of this initial research are that school librarians have an opportunity to (1) provide ""innovation spaces"" that foster curiosity and exploration within their libraries and (2) become role models or ""innovation mentors"" to all students, supporting their motivational and information needs throughout the innovation process.","Small, R V and Laura, J and Meredith, L D",0,,392

For this purpose, 45 pre-service chemistry teachers were administered a questionnaire involving open-ended questions which asked what the importance of teaching chemistry is, and why we teach chemistry in high schools. Based on the written responses, 12 pre-service teachers were chosen to be interviewed to obtain more elaborated information about their beliefs. Data analysis revealed that most of the pre-service teachers expressed that chemistry should be taught in order to explain daily life events. However, a very small number of them believed that teaching chemistry was important in terms of developing generic skills like critical thinking, and of creating curiosity and interest. This study suggests that chemistry should be taught both in high schools and universities in a way which emphasizes the importance of developing scientific skills.","Uzuntiryaki, Esen and Boz, Yezdan",0,,393
524,Creative products: Defining and measuring novel solutions,"There are many different ways of looking at creativity. If you are a student of psychology, it would be surprising if you weren't interested in the role that personality plays in creativity: Who is creative-what personal properties favor creativity, what feelings are associated with it, and what factors motivate it? If your interests tend toward the cognitive and neuroscientific, you might also be concerned with the thinking processes behind creativity: How are we creative-what thinking styles, or processes, characterize creativity? If you are a student of sociology, with an interest in groups, or if you have a particular curiosity about organizations, you might be more interested in the places that creativity occurs: Where are we creative-what aspects of organizations, and the people within them, help or hinder creativity? You have probably also realized that creativity usually occurs for a reason, or in a particular context. In other words, we aren't creative simply for the sake of being creative. This begs one final question: Why are we creative? The answer to this question lies in the fact that creativity is, broadly speaking, a process of generating an outcome. A more concise way to say that is that creativity is concerned with generating an outcome. Focusing on the product probably sounds like it's less the business of social science majors, and more the concern of engineers, and if I tell you I'm a physicist/engineer, working in an engineering school, you may start to wonder why this chapter is in this book! The reasons are simple. First, although products are definitely at the applications end of creativity, we find creative products everywhere, not just in engineering. Second, the key characteristic of products, whether engineered or artistic, is creativity, and that comes from people, employing cognitive processes, within a given setting. In other words, creativity results from the interaction of person, process, press (the organizational climate), and product.

525,Positive Effects of Animals for Psychosocially Vulnerable People: A Turning Point for Delivery,"This chapter first reviews the research-based information about the benefits of pets, especially for the most vulnerable people, and then addresses the practical implementation of this expanding research. The positive psychosocial effects of human/animal relationships engage interest, arising from firsthand experiences with pet animals and scientific curiosity, as well as the practical questions concerning how best to include pets as an adjunct for treatment for an autistic child or a paraplegic veteran, or to enhance the quality of life of an elderly person in an assisted-living facility. Despite the ever-growing research literature on the psychosocial effects of animals, a significant gap remains between that knowledge base and implementing it into treatment or support services for psychosocially vulnerable people. This chapter suggests that to enjoy the positive effects, a relationship with an animal should be individually tailored to the psychosocial characteristics of the person. Epidemiological studies of entire communities identify subcultures where certain individual circumstances, neighborhoods, geographical features, or special situations are associated with beneficial or adverse health parameters. Employing epidemiological methods with statistical representation of the entire community offers a view of the context, including the community's affluence, geography, age, gender, and ethnicity of pet-owning participants. The new development will spearhead the creation and availability of curricular resources and enhance the number of people prepared to provide leadership in the area of human/animal interaction, bringing research into practice. <c2><a9> 2010 Elsevier Inc.

526,Pearls from the early days of PTSD studies,"At the time I first started working with traumatized individuals, the field of traumatic stress was still in its infancy. It was 1989 and I was living, studying, and working in Denmark. My decision to move to Scandinavia was motivated by the potential of an intriguing program in somatic psychology developed at the Bodynamic Institute in Copenhagen. A dynamically trained clinical social worker and body psychotherapist since 1976, I wanted to expand my knowledge and skills. I was drawn to Bodynamic's innovative theory and methodology, which linked motor development and neurophysiology to mental health. Their approach to stabilizing trauma survivors particularly piqued my interest. Of the three pearls discussed in this chapter, the first and second derive directly from my years of training at the Bodynamic Institute. The evolution of the third pearl is somewhat different, however. It is not something I was taught and it is not a technique, but a principle. The concept dawned on me gradually over my early years of direct (as a therapist) and indirect (as a supervisor, trainer, and consultant) work with trauma clients. The three ""clinical pearls"" derived from my work with PTSD include the following: Pearl #1: Teach clients somatic mindfulness; Pearl #2: Develop client boundaries; and Pearl #3: Contain your curiosity.

528,Jenny offill's dept. Of speculation and the revival of fragmentary writing,"The last decade has seen a revival of interest in novels that follow a fragmentary structure. David Mitchell's Cloud Atlas (2005), J. M. Coetzee's Diary of a Bad Year (2007) and Richard McGuire's graphic novel Here (2014) are among the most notable examples of recent works that reject a linear plot narrative and a set of standard ""readerly"" expectations. This article outlines the scope of the current proliferation of fragmentary writing -A category which rarely features in Anglophone (as opposed to French) literary criticism-And delineates its characteristic ingredients. After introducing the main tenets and examples of the six most common categories of fragmentary texts, the article discusses two theoretical frameworks for analysing such works: Joseph Frank's notion of the spatial form and Sharon Spencer's idea of the architectonic novel. The latter conception is applied to a close analysis of the structural variety and randomised composition of one of the most recent and critically acclaimed fragmentary novels -Jenny Offill's Dept. of Speculation (2014), which offers a non-linear and highly intertextual account of a marriage crisis narrated with the use of several hundred loosely connected paragraphs, composed of narrative snippets, multiple quotations, seemingly unrelated anecdotes and scientific curiosities.","DrÄ…g, W",0,,397
529,The measurement of perceptual curiosity,"Perceptual curiosity, as defined by Berlyne (1954), involves interest in and giving attention to novel perceptual stimulation, and motivates visual and sensory-inspection. A 33-item questionnaire constructed to assess individual differences in perceptual curiosity was administered to 320 undergraduate students (202 females; 118 males). The participants also responded to the trait scales of the State-Trait Personality Inventory (STPI), and to selected subscales of the Sensation Seeking (SSS) and Novelty Experiencing (NES) scales. Principal axis factor analyses of the perceptual curiosity (PC) items identified a strong PC factor. With oblique rotation, diversive and specific PC components were found, from which subscales were constructed. Moderate positive correlations of the PC scale and subscales were found with the NES and STPI measures of curiosity and the SSS and NES sensation seeking scales, suggesting that perceptual curiosity involves seeking both knowledge and sensory experience. Divergent validity of the PC scale was demonstrated by minimal relationships with the STPI trait anger scale, and essentially zero correlations with the STPI trait anxiety and depression scales.

This study explores the impact of this program on family participation in science related activities, parental attitudes toward science, parental participation in science, and parental perceptions of their child's ability to do science and choose science as a career. A 50-item ""gender questionnaire"" was used to collect data. The demographics of the participants in the project support the theory that well-educated professional parents tend to create home environments that support scientific curiosity and nurture interest in science. Results indicate that it is possible for informal science education centers to create home-science activities that encourage active participation by both women and young girls. Other findings include: the project did not positively improve how women judge their own aptitude for learning science; participation in the project may have encouraged mothers to purchase more science toys for their children; fathers appeared to hold fewer gender biases than mothers when assessing a child's science interest and capabilities; and both mothers and fathers have more positive expectations for sons than daughters with regard to careers in science.

533,Optimal experience of flow enhanced by telepresence: Evidence from social media use,"Flow has been proposed as an essential component for understanding online behavior and defining the stimulating nature of online experiences. In this research, we examine the impact of flow specifically within the context of social media use. The findings indicate that telepresence positively affects the five dimensions of flow: enjoyment, concentration, challenge, control, and curiosity. These dimensions (except control) are positively related to overall flow, which enhances time distortion and frequency of social media use. In addition, we extend the nomological network on flow theory by developing a model to illustrate the complex relationship between flow, telepresence, time distortion, and frequency of social media use. This study highlights the idea that overall flow can uniquely affect social media users in a flow experience, and it presents interesting results about behavioral intentions during social media use. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Their enforced seclusiveness arises from frequent disappointments in interpersonal relationships, their guilt from acute hostility toward people who disappoint them. The pastor and psychiatrist need to collaborate in treating such patients with warm curiosity and unfailing interest. Every precaution should be taken not to break appointments or fail their expectations and add causes for suspicion.

536,A frame effect in avatar customization: How usersâ€™ attitudes towards their avatars may change depending on virtual context,"The sense of <e2><80><9c>being there<e2><80><9d> that Virtual Reality/Worlds may promote in users depends on multiple factors, one being the relationship between users and the digital figures representing their agency/identity in the simulation (i.e., avatars). Avatars offer innovative resources for psychological assessment, such as clues about users<e2><80><99> self-conception. However, avatar customization may vary depending on the Virtual World context it has to enter. We hypothesize that users may have different attitudes towards avatars created for different contexts; feel more or less represented by different avatars; and that such difference may be influenced by sex, self-esteem (evaluation of one<e2><80><99>s own self) and self-curiosity (disposition/interest to increase knowledge about one<e2><80><99>s own inner world). 87 students (45 females) created two avatars to be used in two different virtual contexts (i.e., Leisure vs. Job) and then responded to questions regarding attitudes towards both their own avatars, namely Similarity to Self, to Ideal Self, Attractiveness, and Difficulty in Customization. Moreover, they filled in validated questionnaires on self-esteem (Rosenberg Self- Esteem Scale) and self-curiosity (Self-Curiosity Attitude-Interest Scale). Results showed that Leisure-avatars were perceived easier to customize and more similar to self than Job-avatars. Analysis involving sex as another variable showed that this difference emerged in females specifically. Moreover, Leisure-avatars were also perceived more similar to ideal self than Job-avatars when controlling for selfcuriosity. Discussion deals with implications for avatar assessment, in that attitudes towards avatars can be influenced by the virtual context, and by individual characteristics such as one<e2><80><99>s own disposition to understand him or herself. <c2><a9> 2017, Interactive Media Institute.

As I have indicated the psychodynamic literature has sometimes emphasized the traumatic or depriving aspects of the impoverished African American child's experience. In this account of the treatment of a twelve year old African American boy from the urban North, with roots in the rural South, I have described how folk beliefs concerning the devil, snakes, and ghosts, as well as religious beliefs concerning ""coming of age"" lent themselves to the boy's beginning creation of a demonic introject.

My goals were to cover a large period of time and to offer sufficient detail. After reviewing the curiosities of the distant past, I demonstrated that, during the period of dualism and at the beginning of the socialist era, complaints were understood to be a form of legal remedy within existing legal procedures; subsidiary complaints falling outside of other procedure were introduced by the old Complaints Law. Though this legislation would not be appropriately harmonised with constitutional rights after the democratic transition, among its merits we may list its comprehensive nature vis-avis all previous efforts, the suitable separation of complaints and public interest disclosures, and the generalisation of the right to their submission.

Instead of being expected to reproduce insights from courses and mandatory reading lists or to apply already selected theories or models to given case materials, the students are expected independently to generate new knowledge relevant to their study subject. This means that the study process has a number of traits in common with research processes and it means that one of the supervisor's primary roles is to support the students' development of academic knowledge and competences. To facilitate the students<e2><80><99> processes of acquiring academic competences by project work requires that the supervisor is aware of a complexity of epistemological principles and research methods and paradigms. It further requires a willingness on the part of the supervisor to let the students<e2><80><99> curiosity and motivation continue to be the driver of the project work. This means to find appropriate ways to acquaint the students with methodological and epistemological reflections. This chapter will address some methodological challenges experienced by the author as facilitator and supervisor of project groups within social science at various levels of education: at the bachelor<e2><80><93>level, masters<e2><80><93>level, and PhD<e2><80><93>level. The author will compose a framework for being sensitive to the students' interests while helping them to select methods and approaches. Therefore, although the subject of this chapter rests on the philosophy of science, the focus and exposition will be a supervisor's perspective. <c2><a9> Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Jensen, I",0,10.1007/978-3-319-09716-9_9,408

543,Development--Continued [Part 4],"This lesson, originally written for a class of teachers, concludes a series of four lessons on pupils' development. With a solid conception of your aim to aid your students' development, how should you proceed to get the minds of your pupils to reach it? You must watch nature and then try to improve upon her. To cultivate the observing powers, nature presents objects; you must do likewise. But if you do no more than that, you will add nothing to the education of nature. Object lessons which consist in telling the pupils what you have observed, do nothing to cultivate their observing powers. You must get them to observe something which they have not observed before; you must get them to observe closely, carefully, systematically. How are you to do this? You can only do it by imitating nature. Nature supplies a motive. The incessant handling of this, and looking at that which so fill up the time of children, result from their interest in these things. You must deepen that interest. You must stimulate their curiosity by asking them questions which they cannot answer about objects which they think they know all about. Above all, you must show an interest in their discoveries; the more the better, if you really have it. To tell a child this and to show it the other, is not to teach it how to observe, but to make it a mere recipient of another's observations; a proceeding which weakens rather than strengthens its powers of self-instruction--which deprives it of the pleasures resulting from successful activity--which presents this all-attractive knowledge under the guise of formal tuition--and which thus generates that indifference and even disgust with which such object lessons are not infrequently regarded. If it were practicable to give each boy and girl a separate teacher, as Locke recommended, we might possibly avoid requiring a pupil to study any subject when he did not feel like it, or when he preferred to study something else. But in a system of class instruction this is impossible. The more successful you are in interesting your pupils, the more impossible it is to avoid an element of irksomeness in the work of the school. And if it were possible to rely entirely on interest as a motive, I do not believe it would be desirable. It is an exceedingly important part of education for one to acquire the power to do disagreeable things. Unless you help your pupils to form the habit of doing what is reasonable, whether it is pleasant or not, their intellectual development will certainly suffer, since no other motive can be relied on to make the boy do the work he ought to do at school, and the man read the books he ought to read in later life.

544,The EMDR-accelerated information resourcing (EMDR-AIR) protocol,"The EMDR Accelerated Information Resourcing Protocol (EMDR-AIR Protocol) is designed to accelerate the search for the resources necessary to resolve the client's current crisis or long-term issues. The idea evolved from the ""Double-Hai"" paradigm (Yoeli & Prattos, 2005), which is a short-term intervention for use with couples. The EMDR-AIR Protocol is designed to look for that learned generational reaction to trauma that the client is currently using to cope with the current situation while, at the same time, tapping into the historical strengths and resources that enabled survival. These resources are found through the rapid accessing of client history by using the Multi-Tiered Trans-Generational Genogram (MTTG). The MTTG is a format that brings life and new energy into your work with clients and into the life of your client. As the therapist and the client evolve the MTTG, the client teaches the therapist and himself about his richly textured history. Through the legacy of this history, the client gains clarity about his circumstances and an appreciation of life under the best and worst circumstances. Through the practitioner's interest and curiosity, the client learns the fascination that comes from viewing the dynamics of his family through the generations. The process creates a longer lasting effect, solidifying the results of the EMDR session. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Yoeli, Frances R and Prattos, Tessa",0,,411
545,Engagement factors and Motivation in E-Learning and Blended-Learning Projects,"Virtual education is one of the most significant tools in what EU Commission calls Lifelong Learning (LLL), and learners' engagement is a capital aspect to succeed in any online formative activities. Therefore, this paper is devoted to reach three main objectives to improve virtual formative experiences: Identifying which motivational factors are more significant in e-Learning/blended-learning processes as well as in technology-supported on-campus teaching. Discovering which kinds of digital and 2.0 tools for creating multimedia educational resources are best considered according to their capacity to keep students engaged in virtual educative projects. Clarifying which types of learning products (that is, e-assessments) are most suitable to help e-learners acquire good quality knowledge along with practical competences while keeping motivation throughout the course. In order to achieve these aims, it was developed a research process focused on the aforementioned subjects and based on building a specific questionnaire with 36 questions (in four sections) about motivation in e-learning, keeping in mind the conclusions derived from a previous literature review. This questionnaire was filled in by 65 experts on e-Learning and hybrid teaching (mainly from Spain and South America) whom were connected by emailing. After applying qualitative statistical analysis to their responses, several interesting conclusions came up, such as: Awakening students' sensible curiosity by means of a suitable diversity in how contents are presented will improve grades and levels of satisfaction. Including an equalitarian and integrative internal motivational system will increase engagement and retention. Accessibility is a key point in relation to how e-learners get engaged in an educative project and get benefits from it. This is particularly important in the early stages of the course. And some other evidences that are described in the paper. This research will be useful to develop new instructional design models centered in getting and keeping e-learners' attention and motivation through involving new techniques like gamification or creative problem-solving activities. Besides, these results will help educators discover the main factors they should pay attention when designing e-learning tasks and selecting web 2.0 tools for the 21st century students.","Gutierrez Priego, Ruben and Garcia Peralta, Azahara",0,10.1145/2536536.2536606,412
546,"With NSF Support, Research Moves into Science Labs of 2-Year Colleges","Original research in biology, which is thought to spark student interest and bolster majors, makes its way to the associate-degree level. Through a grant from the National Science Foundation, students of biology in community colleges will have the chance to do research on open-ended, real-world questions with no predetermined answers--and experience all the rewards and frustrations that come with that work. Many four-year institutions have come to see that undergraduates should be given the chance to do complex, hands-on projects that go beyond the cookbook-style experiments found in traditional introductory science labs. Such open-ended research projects are widely thought to confer educational benefits because they pique students' curiosity, expose them to more-authentic ways of engaging in scientific inquiry, and allow them to work closely with faculty members. The National Research Council of the National Academies, in its 2003 report on changing the teaching of biology, recommended that all students be encouraged to conduct independent research ""as early as is practical in their education.""","Berrett, Dan",0,,413
547,Effectiveness of Three Case Studies and Associated Teamwork in Stimulating Freshman Interest in an Introduction to Engineering Course,"The effectiveness of three case studies and associated teamwork to stimulate interest of college freshman in engineering was investigated by observing students. Case studies were assigned as laboratory team exercises in an introduction to engineering course at Auburn University. Student interest in the case studies was evaluated qualitatively based on the use of communication, decision making, and application of basic preparatory knowledge. Evaluations were made of laboratory sections as a whole, for four sections. The greatest student interest and enthusiasm in a case study occurred when there was not an existing ""right or correct"" answer and the answer was open-ended. Student interest was the least when the best answer to a case study was already known by the students. The order in which case studies are assigned was found to be important to prevent biasing student judgment with previous case studies. Case studies selected for a freshman course should be structured and limited in technical scope so students have more time to make and support decisions. Teamwork and student discussion expanded student perspectives of problems when they were part of a case study solution process. Student discussion of case studies continued beyond completion of the formal assignments when case study outcomes were given at the end of the course. The effectiveness of case studies was found to be very dependent upon the purpose of a case study and the preparation by the instructor to invoke the intangible faculties of curiosity and interest in students. The measures of effectiveness in using case studies as learning tools should be based upon thoroughness of student reasoning, ability of students to communicate their ideas, and the presentation of supporting rational for their decisions.","McIntyre, Joseph S",0,,414
548,A randomized clinical trial of a postdeployment parenting intervention for service members and their families with very young children,"Objective: Parenting through the deployment cycle presents unique stressors for military families. To date, few evidence-based and military-specific parenting programs are available to support parenting through cycles of deployment separation and reintegration, especially for National Guard/Reserve members. The purpose of this research was to test the efficacy of a parenting program developed specifically to support military families during reintegration. Method: Within 1 year of returning from deployment to Afghanistan or Iraq, 115 service members with very young children were randomly assigned to receive either the Strong Families Strong Forces Parenting Program at baseline or after a 12-week waiting period. Using a home-based modality, service members, at-home parents, and their young child were assessed at baseline, 3 months posttreatment/wait period, and 6 months from baseline. Results: Service member parents in Strong Families evidenced greater reductions in parenting stress and mental health distress relative to those in the waitlist comparison group. Service members with more posttraumatic stress symptoms reported higher levels of perceived parental efficacy in the intervention group than service members in the comparison group. Intervention also resulted in enhanced parental reflective capacity, including increased curiosity and interest in the young child among those in the intervention group relative to comparison. Conclusion: Service member parents and their spouses demonstrated high interest in participating in a postdeployment parenting program targeting families with very young children. Findings point to the feasibility, appeal, and efficacy of Strong Families in this initial trial and suggest promise for implementation in broader military and community service systems. <c2><a9> 2016 American Psychological Association.","De Voe, E R and Paris, M A R and Ross, A and Acker, M",0,10.1037/tra0000196,415
549,"Beyond being there: Practices that establish presence, engage students and influence intellectual curiosity in a structured online learning environment","To fully understand teaching presence and its implications for the intellectual climate of an online classroom it is necessary to explore the phenomenon from the perspective of the instructors who experience it. Informed by the theoretical perspective of the Community of Inquiry (CoI) model, the actions, intentions and perceptions of instructors were investigated through a collective case study. The goal of this study was to examine the decision processes employed in establishing teaching presence in a structured online environment in order to make a contribution to the body of knowledge from a practical pedagogical perspective. Using the lived experiences of instructors enabled the exploration of the influence pedagogical choices had on the creation of an intellectual climate in the online context. Using semi-structured interviews as the main source of data, the study utilized the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) method as an analytical tool to address concerns of rigor in the qualitative interpretation of experiential data. Results of the collective case revealed student engagement and intellectual curiosity were influenced most greatly by an instructor<e2><80><99>s active interest and passion for teaching, an ability to identify the relevance of course topics to the student, and the encouragement for a shared responsibility in the learning process. The findings showed that the shared goal of learning extended beyond the stated learning objectives and expected outcomes of a course and served as a foundation in the creation of authentic relationships between instructor and students. In addressing the overarching research question of how instructors establish teaching presence and inspire intellectual curiosity in a structured teaching environment, the findings of this study contribute to knowledge related to the nature of teaching presence and its role in setting an academic climate in an online classroom. <c2><a9> 2017, The Online Learning Consortium.

550,Relational freedom: Emergent properties of the interpersonal field,"Relational Freedom: Emergent Properties of the Interpersonal Field addresses the interpersonal field in clinical psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, especially the emergent qualities of the field. The book builds on the foundation of unformulated experience, dissociation, and enactment defined and explored in Stem's previous, widely read books. Stern never considers the analyst or the patient alone; all clinical events take place between them and involve them both. Their conscious and unconscious conduct and experience are the field's substance. We can say that the changing nature of the field determines the experience that patient and analyst can create in one another's presence; but we can also say that the therapeutic dyad, simply by doing their work together, ceaselessly configures and reconfigures the field. ""Relational freedom"" is Stern's own interpersonal and relational conception of the field, which he compares, along with other varieties of interpersonal/relational field theory, to the work of Bionian field theorists such as Madeleine and Willy Baranger and Antonino Ferro. Other chapters concern the role of the field in accessing the frozen experience of trauma, in creating theories of therapeutic technique, evaluating quantitative psychotherapy research, evaluating the utility of the concept of unconscious phantasy, treating the hard-to-engage patient, and in devising the ideal psychoanalytic institute. Relational Freedom is a clear, authoritative, and impassioned statement of the current state of interpersonal and relational psychoanalytic theory and clinical thinking. It will interest anyone who wants to stay up to date with current developments in American psychoanalysis, and for those newer to the field it will serve as an introduction to many of the important questions in contemporary psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysts and psychotherapists of all kinds will profit from the book's thoughtful discussions of clinical problems and quandaries.

559,A Mixed Reality neighborhood tour: Understanding visitor experience and perceptions,"Museums are increasingly turning to technology to improve their offerings. This presents an opportunity to surrounding neighborhoods to take advantage of the museum in order to connect with visitors and offer them a glimpse into their community. The work presented in this article contributes to advancing the state of the art in designing Mixed Reality (MR) entertainment experiences by presenting and discussing Yasmine's Adventures (YA), a mobile application aiming to extend the museum visitor's experience into the surrounding neighborhood. YA demonstrates the potential of MR in engaging visitors to explore neglected urban areas. This is achieved by incorporating the opinions of community members, and other contextual information, into a fictional storytelling journey, delivered through a MR entertainment experience distributed in real space. Consequently, users are provided with opportunity to connect with enriched portraits of these spaces. Results from a quantitative and qualitative evaluation showed that participants' perception of the neighborhood was positively affected by the experience, which fostered curiosity and willingness to explore the neighborhood both at the spatial and social levels. By taking the tour, participants increased their interest in interacting with locals and fostered greater knowledge of the area, which they were willing to share after experiencing it.","Nisi, Valentina and Dionisio, Mara and Barreto, Mary and Nunes, Nuno",0,10.1016/j.entcom.2018.04.002,420
561,Curious conceptions: Learning to be old,"The ageing of the population in western societies has aroused great concern and interest in recent years as the so-called 'baby-boomers' begin to retire, leaving a seemingly depleted workforce. Society and the individuals within it learn the 'truths' of being aged or old through the normalizing of gerontological, demographic and economic knowledge, where 'the old' are marginalized as the unimaginable other, taking up resources through their increasing dependence. Using aspects of my research on women experiencing retirement, I outline such learning as it specifically relates to women who have been constituted as 'other' all our lives. Being old is yet another such formulation. As a means to counter such learning I suggest we develop what Foucault calls curiosity, not to uncover 'the truth' but as 'a readiness to find what surrounds us strange and odd; a certain determination to throw off familiar ways of thought and to look at the same things in a different way' (M. Foucault, The masked philosopher, in: P. Rabinow (Ed.) Michel Foucault: ethics, subjectivity and truth (vol. 1) (London, Penguin, 1994/ 1980), p. 325). Through the deployment of such curiosity we may be able to unlearn how we have been constituted as old women.","Carroll, T",0,10.1080/01580370601146338,421
562,Collectible: The social and ethical implications surrounding the collected object,"Collecting and preserving objects under the rubric of cultural heritage is a practice encouraged by various nationally and internationally respected bodies. The understanding that we must collect and preserve for posterity implicitly also raises the question of what we should we collect and preserve. This paper will address ideas surrounding the collectible object; in particular, the social and ethical implications entwined around the object once it is taken into a museum collection will be examined. As eloquently phrased by art historians John Elsner and Roger Cardinal, <e2><80><98>the collection is the unique bastion against the deluge of time<e2><80><99> (Cardinal and Elsner, The cultures of collecting. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, p 1, 1994). Collections offer immortality insofar as they can be preserved. They also serve as points of reference, tracing a history of ideas, interest and practice and, some might even argue, humanity. Over time, the roles of the museums and the collectors have changed radically. Having started as bodies which collected and displayed curiosities, provoking and satisfying visitors<e2><80><99> inquisitiveness, now the museum and collector legitimise the objects they select through their roles as culture-makers. It is their job to evaluate and rank objects within a system of <e2><80><98>value, rarity, and aesthetics<e2><80><99> (Weems, Art history and American art. In: Schewmaker H, Waida ST (eds) Material culture in America <e2><80><93> understanding everyday life. ABC-CLIO, US, p 43, 2008). This, in turn, means that we must hold them accountable for creating the theoretical context in which its objects are understood by current, as well as future, audiences. The museum and collector have, by necessity, become recognised interpreters of the objects they collect (UNESCO/ICOM, Running a museum: a practical handbook. http://<e2><80><8b>unesdoc.<e2><80><8b>unesco.<e2><80><8b>org/<e2><80><8b>images/<e2><80><8b>0014/<e2><80><8b>001410/<e2><80><8b>141067e.<e2><80><8b>pdf, 2006).

By taking an interdisciplinary approach, which considers the framework surrounding the concept of collectability from various standpoints, a wider understanding of the complexities of the issue at hand should be reached, thereby encouraging and stimulating further thought on this matter. <c2><a9> Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","Kromholz, S",0,10.1007/978-3-642-45094-5_11,422

564,FOUNDATIONS OF PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING - SOME EXPLANATORY NOTES,"The present article elaborates on cognitive effects of problem-based learning put forward by Schmidt, De Volder, De Grave, Moust & Patel (1989) and Norman & Schmidt (1992). Its purpose is to discuss, in some detail, the theoretical premises of this approach to learning and instruction. It is argued that problem-based learning, above all, promotes the activation of prior knowledge and its elaboration. Evidence is reviewed demonstrating that these processes actually occur in small-group tutorials and that the processing of new information is indeed facilitated by discussion of a relevant problem. These effects must be attributed to a reorganization taking place in the knowledge structures of students as a result of problem-oriented study. In addition, a cognitive process called epistemic curiosity (or intrinsic interest) is enabled. Some directions for further research are outlined. The contribution starts, however, with a discussion of the philosophical and pedagogical roots of problem-based learning.","SCHMIDT, H G",0,10.1111/j.1365-2923.1993.tb00296.x,424

A paradigm debate started in the main conference has sparked controversy and curiosity in addition to confusion. Despite these substantive achievements, a computer conference can be a frustrating experience. There seems to be an analogy to the operation of a computer conference. Among the principal investigators of Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES) groups there seems to be a feeling of disappointment in the results of the exercise so far.

566,Group experiments in elementary psychology: Students' manual and notebook,"It is scarcely necessary to elaborate on the need for collateral experimental work in elementary science classes. Materials presented by the lecture and textbook are desirable and enable the student to obtain a clearly stated and efficiently digested account of the subject-matter. Good scholarship implies a healthy respect for authority and a willingness to examine the works of others. However, when the elementary student must depend solely on the word of teachers and textbook writers, there seems to be a possibility that subject-matter becomes pure dogma, and learning becomes a form of ancestor worship. In no other natural science than psychology is it so easily possible to confuse the boundary between facts and pure theory, between rigidly controlled observations and carelessly remembered everyday experiences. The intense popular interest in this subject has been not accompanied by the exact investigatory attitude of the research worker. The material brought together here has been selected in order to adapt the book to the situations present in a large group of colleges throughout the country. It is presented with the idea of giving every elementary student in the beginning course some exposure to laboratory facts. In this respect psychology may approach the scientific positions already achieved by the other biological sciences, botany, zoology, and the physical sciences, chemistry and physics. A minimum amount of exposure to laboratory facts should be considered a requirement for every beginning student in the science. I have, therefore, selected material which can be used in large classes, keeping in mind the fact that courses in psychology are among the heaviest attended in the colleges and universities. Most of the experiments are adaptations of classical investigations in general psychology, and only a few of the experiments may be definitely classed as ""applied psychology."" It seems that it is important to give an elementary student the general foundations of a science, first, and we may trust that, later, his applied science will be all the better because of a more thorough understanding of the general science. The experiments, here presented, were largely tried in the three-hour elementary psychology course in the University of Michigan. The lecturer and usually one assistant conducted the experiment, though in some experiments an extra assistant was used. Where special subjects were needed, volunteers were taken from the class. The experiments in applied psychology, in the last chapter, were used in classes in applied psychology only. In our experience it has not been necessary to show immediate practical application of an experiment in order to keep a large class interested in the work. The average college student possesses enough scientific curiosity to follow through the results of a general experiment without demanding ulterior values. Practically all of the experiments in general psychology have been used for a duration of one year. Some of the experiments have been used for four years.

569,The period of acquaintance,"Man is lord of creation, the supreme being among all the animals of the earth. All progress beyond natural evolution is due to him. Yet man at his birth is among the feeblest of earth's living creatures. In his little realm of activities he is guided entirely by instinct, and of this he probably has less than any other of the higher animals and less than many of the lower types. All his wants must be administered by others. In an almost utterly helpless condition he is ushered into the world with absolutely no knowledge of what awaits him. Yet, helpless as he is, his life will require a thousand times more intelligence than that of any other animal. Fortunately it requires many years to reach maturity, giving him abundance of time to become acquainted with his surroundings and to acquire skill in the use of his powers. In all these years he is mainly dependent upon others for life and learning. How eagerly the mother watches for signs of intelligence in her child. The first smile is proclaimed as though it were the rarest phenomenon. The gradual acquirement of the use of hand and eye and ear are each noted with the greatest interest and satisfaction to such an extent that, to the doting parent, it is doubtful if any child ever before progressed so rapidly. At six weeks, the baby recognizes each member of the household and is lavish with his smiles. At two months he can guide his hand to his mouth, and tests everything within the grasp of that all-important organ. His chief interest in life seems to center in finding something to eat. His principal activities consist in exercising his limbs and his lungs.

570,A Functional Model of Kitsch and Art: Linking Aesthetic Appreciation to the Dynamics of Social Motivation,"With the advent of modernity, change and novelty have become the core values of artistic production. At the same time the derogatory term ``kitsch'' was coined to contrast truly ground-breaking artistic achievements. In this article, we argue that kitsch and avant-garde art ideally represent two complementary types of aesthetic experience: a fluent one that allows for immediate emotional gratification (kitsch) and a disfluent one that requires cognitive elaboration (art). We make a case that preferences for the one or the other are dynamically related to a set of conflicting needs which constitute the basic dilemma of human attachment behavior: needs for safety and intimacy versus needs for arousal and autonomy. Based on the Zurich Model of Social Motivation we hypothesize that social distance regulation and aesthetic liking are synchronized via notions of self-efficacy and autonomy: Whenever we feel safe and self-sufficient, an appetence for arousal (curiosity) is likely to arise that increases our interest in unfamiliar conspecifics as well as in innovative, cognitively challenging aesthetic stimuli (art). By contrast, when we feel vulnerable and dependent, a longing for safety and relatedness (nostalgia) attracts us not only to familiar and trustworthy individuals but also to conventional aesthetic stimuli charged with positive emotions (kitsch). This theoretical framework offers an integrative perspective on dynamics of aesthetic liking in that it unites a wide variety of phenomena from anthropology, developmental, and cognitive psychology with concepts and findings from art history, sociology of art, and empirical aesthetics.","Ortlieb, Stefan A and Carbon, Claus-Christian",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02437,428

572,"Collaborative survey construction for national data collection: Coordination, negotiation, and delivery","This research-to-practice full paper describes the deliberate and arduous process we recently went through to develop a national survey to study the non-cognitive traits of undergraduate engineering and computing students. The goal of this survey is to characterize student profiles in order to develop and examine particular interventions to guide students toward success in engineering and computing majors. This survey measures non-cognitive attributes including personality, sense of belonging, engineering or computing identity, study skills, well-being, and a variety of other constructs that are not routinely measured in engineering populations nor integrated into admission decisions, advising processes, or academic curricula. Prior research indicates that these non-cognitive attributes are important for students' academic success and retention. However, no studies have examined a comprehensive set of non-cognitive traits holistically to understand how they influence student success. This collaborative project, funded by three linked NSF grants, merges the interests of researchers at three campuses in understanding and supporting students with varied non-cognitive profiles. As part of this research, we negotiated the content of a national survey, suitable for use on our own campuses as well as with other national partners, to probe more than a dozen constructs collectively describing student non-cognitive attributes. The construction of the survey itself was non-trivial, and involved significant negotiations among the researchers including initial collection of instruments with validity evidence to serve as a basis for discussion; an in-person kick-off meeting; multiple follow-up teleconferences; multiple rounds of inclusion/exclusion decisions based upon mutually-agreed upon guiding principles; pilot survey testing; pilot data evaluations such as exploratory factor analysis; and final decisions about instruments/items to include in the final version, all while considering survey length, distribution channels, and key IRB concerns. This paper details the 10-month effort to construct a survey that meets the research needs and intellectual curiosity of partners at three diverse campuses. In this process, we had to balance the different institutional contexts of the funded partner sites while also maintaining flexibility for national distribution. The deliberate processes we used may serve as a template for future survey creation, starting from constructs of interest, to selection of specific instruments (or sub-scales thereof), and factor analysis to consider further down-selection of individual items to include in the final survey. The outcomes of this paper may serve the engineering education community by highlighting previously undocumented processes in collaborative survey construction that introduce intellectual complexity or time delays into the development timeline. <c2><a9> 2018 IEEE.","Berger, E and Godwin, A and Scheidt, M and Chen, J and Senkpeil, R and Ge, J and Widmann, J and Self, B and Gates, A",0,10.1109/FIE.2018.8658829,430
573,Innovations in Detroit Head Start. [Videotape],"The Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood teaching is based on curriculum and teaching practices developed in the preschools of Reggio Emilia, Italy. This video highlights an ongoing Detroit, Michigan Head Start staff development project, inspired by the Reggio Emilia approach. The staff development program was launched in consultation with Reggio Children, and is sponsored by the Merrill-Palmer Institute of Wayne State University and the Head Start Division of the Detroit Human Services Department. The 16-minute video is organized around the principles of the Reggio Emilia approach, including focus on children's self expression through graphic representation, language, movement and music; teachers as partners in learning through children's interest and curiosity; expanding the environment to allow children to pursue interests, and the project approach, whereby children explore a topic over an extended period of time. The video focuses largely on the impact of the program on the teachers, and features their reflections concerning the Reggio principles and the teachers' experiences in adapting them to the Head Start program. The importance of time in children's learning, the role of the parent, and collaboration of the program's teachers are also highlighted. Also featured are vignettes of the children engaged in a variety of interesting classroom situations and the impressions of some of the parents with children in the program.

574,Educational use and motivational elements of simulation games for mining engineering students: a phenomenological study,"This phenomenological study investigates mining engineering students<e2><80><99> game playing experiences for educational purposes and seeks to understand the essence of their experiences. In this study, three non-gamer and three-gamer mining engineering students were selected through a criterion sampling method, and then data were collected through in-depth phenomenological interviews and focus group interviews. The study showed that visualisation, learning by doing and motivation were the common themes for the benefits of the use of games in education, whereas addiction, underestimation and time management emerged as the possible problems. Motivational elements were found to be challenge, curiosity, control, information seeking, observation, assessment, hypothesis building and decision making that shaped the participants<e2><80><99> experiences.

580,Denmark: Early adoption and continued progress of GIS for education,"Danish geography teachers have used geography-oriented IT programs since the early 1990s, and thus have been one of the pioneer subject-areas to introduce IT to the classroom. One of the first programs, called Hefaistos, could display a computer model of plate tectonics, where the localization and depth of earthquakes and volcanoes could be studied. Other programs could construct age pyramids, make demographic prognoses, and simulate weather stations. Many of these early programs were conceived and constructed by individual enthusiasts, who created everything from the initial idea to the finished product. This meant that product development depended too much on individual initiative. If, instead, basic standard programs were readily available, enthusiastic teachers would have more time and space for teaching experiments. This was realized in 1998 when the Remote Sensing program Science Image became one of the standards in digital image processing. It was a very efficient teaching tool that could make animations of various Meteosat images and ""cloud movies"" of global wind systems with students controlling the playing speed of the movie. Such up-to-date, topical satellite images entered the classroom via satellite or the Internet, and this aroused curiosity and created an interest in studying such digital images in class. <c2><a9> Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.","Jensen, T P",0,10.1007/978-94-007-2120-3_8,433
581,"LEVINSON,DANIEL AND HIS THEORY OF ADULT DEVELOPMENT - A REMINISCENCE AND","I offer some reminiscences occasioned by the death of Daniel Levinson, a modern pioneer in the study of the human life cycle. I clarify three controversial aspects of Levinson's theory-its universality, the role of critical life events, and the place of relationships-as well as briefly foreshadow findings from his forthcoming book on women. I show that relationships to people, enterprises, and social institutions are the stuff out of which the individual life structure-levinson's central concept-is formed. Levinson's dream was of a society in which the developmental needs of adults were better understood and met so that they could more generatively fill their roles in the institutions upon which the young depend. He thought this essential to the evolution of a society that would be both more competent and more humane. In this dream, which was a product of his own difficult mid-life transition and a measure of the success he achieved in integrating its polarities, Levinson united a warm, scientific interest in others with an affectionate curiosity about nature.","NEWTON, P M",0,10.1007/BF02260089,434
582,Investigating Birthdays: A Library Research Project,"An approach to using a student's own birthday as the basis of a library research project for college and high school students is described in this brief article. AUTHOR'S COMMENT (excerpt): I found my students became very excited about a topic that introduced them to the library while exciting their curiosity and interest: to investigate events that occurred on the day they were born. Students begin by reading the ""New York Times"" the day of and following their birthdays. They isolate three or four news items that interest them, and are ready to begin research. After checking leads in periodical indexes, the card catalog, almanacs, and biographies, students limit themselves to a single topic. Their introduction to the library and its resources becomes a systematic process of discovery. This assignment met several objectives. Students learned to use a variety of resources from the library, following a systematic course of investigation. They learned to limit a topic from materials gathered and to formulate a thesis. They learned about a time in their past lives that is meaningful to the present. But, most importantly, this project satisfed my desire of having a research project that is both relevant and interesting to my students. (KC)","Flavin, Louise",0,,435
583,Breaking Free from Myths about Teaching and Learning: Innovation as an Engine for Student Success,"When you hear students say that what they learn in school doesn't have much to do with life, or that getting the answer right is the most important thing, or that learning is only about getting good grades, what they're doing is reflecting a general set of expectations that are reinforced by schools themselves. Here's a book that boldly contends that there's a way to change that by breaking free from these myths that negatively affect learning. Teacher, author, and consultant Allison Zmuda explains how schools can rewire for a more optimistic, empowered, and dynamic view of learning by: (1) Changing from teacher-directed and highly routinized programs to practices that engage students in thinking, working, and interacting with others; (2) Inviting students to apply their prior knowledge and personal interests in solving relevant problems and communicating their thinking; and (3) Aligning daily practices with how the brain works and how learners learn. This call to action stakes out clear goals for any school that wants to become a 21st century learning organization, such as: (1) Redefine curriculum as essential questions and complex problems; (2) Design lessons that promote your students' construction of knowledge and continued curiosity; and (3) Base student performance on hard work and powerful habits rather than speed of recall.","Zmuda, Allison and Development, Association for Supervision and Curriculum",0,,436
584,Positioning Strategies for Animal-Friendly Products: A Social Dilemma Approach,"Many consumers express concerns about the welfare of animals in agriculture, but often refrain from purchasing animal-friendly alternatives that address their concerns. To support consumers in making choices in line with their values and attitudes, this study approaches consumer animal-friendly product choice as a dilemma between maximizing the buyer's self-interest and maximizing societal interest. To address this social dilemma, we developed and tested positioning strategies that reinforce the animal welfare label with complementary consumption values (functional, emotional, social, and epistemic). The results from a choice experiment with Dutch chicken meat shoppers showed that two strategies<e2><80><94>emotional and epistemic<e2><80><94>effectively increase consumer value perceptions. These insights imply that animal-friendly products positioned to invoke emotion or curiosity drive consumers towards animal-friendly product choices, and that these strategies are most effective for consumers who base their choice solely on maximizing either self-interest or societal interest. <c2><a9> 2019 The Authors.

585,Introducing Undergraduate Students to Metabolomics Using a NMR-Based Analysis of Coffee Beans,"Metabolomics applies multivariate statistical analysis to sets of high-resolution spectra taken over a population of biologically derived samples. The objective is to distinguish subpopulations within the overall sample population, and possibly also to identify biomarkers. While metabolomics has become part of the standard analytical toolbox in many areas of chemical research, its principles and methods have not yet been generally incorporated into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Identification of the arabica and robusta varieties of green coffee beans using H-1 NMR-based principle component analysis provides an inexpensive teaching laboratory experiment that introduces students to the methods of metabolomics. The experiment does not require any expensive chemicals, or unique equipment or software, or access to higher-field instruments. Because there is a general curiosity among students about the chemical composition of coffee, the experiment is also particularly engaging to the students' interest and imagination.","Sandusky, Peter Olaf",0,10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00559,438
586,Interested in Different Things or in Different Ways?,"Openness and intellect may differentially predict engagement for two possible reasons. First, engagement with sensory experiences is associated with openness, whereas engagement with abstract information is associated with intellect - a distinction based on content. Second, openness reflects affective, and intellect cognitive processing - a distinction based on affect. These two positions are contrasted through associations of both openness and intellect with interest in a broad range of stimuli. Participants (N = 191) viewed images of visual art, philosophical quotations, and scientific discoveries and rated them on interest, appraised novelty and understanding. Only openness predicted greater interest in all stimuli types. Appraised understanding mediated the openness-interest relationship for visual art and philosophy, while intellect was associated with greater appraised understanding of science and philosophy. Openness was associated with weaker understanding-interest relationships for visual art, and greater reactivity to novelty for science and philosophy. We conclude that one way to think of the engagement distinction between openness and intellect is in terms of emotional versus cognitive engagement. That is, the aspects reflect engagement in different ways rather than in different things.","Fayn, Kirill and Silvia, Paul J and MacCann, Carolyn and Tiliopoulos, Niko",0,10.1027/1614-0001/a000243,439
587,Potential uses of noncognitive measurement in education,"Examined the potential educational import of noncognitive personal characteristics, with particular reference to problems in their measurement. Several noncognitive variables are discussed in terms of their distinctive features and educational relevance, including experiential background factors, affects, attitudes, interests, motives, curiosity, temperament, social sensitivity, coping strategies, cognitive styles, creativity, and values. Their different roles in various educational functions are briefly examined, especially in improving access and educational opportunity, setting objectives and standards, guidance, selection, placement, instruction and learning, and evaluation. Attention is drawn to some dangers and difficulties in using noncognitive measures in educational practice and to the need for safeguards against misuse.

588,Sensational interests as a form of intrasexual competition,"Sensational interests, i.e. a curiosity for the violent and macabre, are reputedly common in mentally disordered offenders. However, ostensibly well-adjusted individuals are also interested in these topics. We tested the hypothesis that individual differences in sensational interests may partially reflect intrasexual competition for status and have an underlying evolutionary function. Several predictions derive from this hypothesis. First, age and sex should be directly related to individual differences in mating effort (the degree that an individual devotes resources to finding and guarding sexual partners). Second, mating effort should directly influence sensational interests. Third, there should also be direct effects of age and sex on sensational interests. To test these predictions we collected data on 969 university undergraduates using the Revised Version of the Sensational Interests Questionnaire (SIQ-R) and the Mating effort Scale (MES). A structural equations model revealed that a single factor accounted for the majority of the variance of the three SIQ-R subscales, Paranormal, Militarism, and Criminal Identity. This model also included direct effects of age and sex on the MES and two SIQ-R subscales and direct effects of the MES on the SIQ-R. Model fit statistics indicated that this model was a good fit to the data. We conclude that, even in a non-clinical sample, an affinity for sensational interests might serve a form of intrasexual competition. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

589,CONNECTING TANGIBLE HISTORIC RESOURCES TO INTANGIBLE HISTORICAL CONCEPTS,"Teaching history in the classroom (at any level) can be a challenge. Most students enter a history class expecting to be bored, and hence the instructor must begin an uphill climb to capture the interest of the students. Similarly, when teaching history to visitors of historic sites, the guide often has an audience that includes a small portion who are interested and many others who are merely along with their relative or friend. Thus, the challenge here is similar too: to find a way to captivate the entire audience. In my four years of experience teaching history in the classroom and six years of experience teaching at historic sites, I have found my peers to be far more successful in the latter environment than the former. Why? As historical interpreters, we are trained to inspire the audience in the short time that we have with them, rather than trying to overload them with all the information we can possibly muster about the historic resource at hand. First, there simply is not enough time to discuss everything (much the same way an instructor feels when deciding what to cover in a course). Second, overwhelming the audience with the maximum amount of information tends to turn them off to the subject rather than exciting them about the topic (a common trap for classroom instructors). The key, as interpreters are taught, is to find a way to use the tangible historic resource to connect the audience to an intangible concept, thus provoking the audience into curiosity. This allows them not only to learn from the short time spent together, but more importantly to develop a curiosity about the subject that goes far beyond the moment of provocation. The National Register of Historic Places (United States Department of Interior) recognizes five types of historic resources: districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects. Each of these tangible historic resources could be used in the history classroom to help students become fascinated about the topic and thus interested to learn about intangible historical concepts - and possibly inspired to explore more about the subject outside of the confines of the course. Each of these five types of historic resources are defined differently and specifically by the National Register, and each of them could be used in its own unique way at various stages of the course to incorporate these resources into the education objective of the course. This paper explores ways that the instructor can utilize this tactic to provide a more complete education experience for students. This paper attempts to overcome the challenge of teaching intangible historical concepts in the classroom by using tangible historic resources. I will draw upon my years of experience of educating people about history in different types of settings to build a bridge between the too often disconnected fields of academic history and public history. While collaboration between the disjointed fields would benefit both sides, this particular paper focuses on how elements of public history can enrich the academic history classroom.","Andonian, Raffi E",0,,442

The purpose of this special issue is to highlight advancements of humor scholars following Martineau's seminal work with the ultimate goal of initiating a new curiosity and interest in the social consequences of disparagement humor. Accordingly, this special issue is comprised of articles that review the existing literature, and present innovative, new empirical studies and theoretical frameworks that extend and refine our understanding of disparagement humor. This special issue features nine articles that expand upon Martineau's work. The first four articles focus primarily on Martineau's intragroup setting in which members of a common in-group share disparagement humor. The papers test and expand upon Martineau's hypotheses that disparagement humor fosters a negative disposition toward the targeted out-group and greater cohesion among members of the humor-initiating in-group.

As Superintendent of Enfield Receiving Hospital, John encountered aboriginal patients from remote communities and became convinced of the impossibility of appreciating their mental life without a nuanced understanding social and cultural context. During the 1950s, he was awarded a Harkness Fellowship, which took him to Johns Hopkins and Harvard where began collaboration with an extraordinary range of American luminaries. Returning to Adelaide he completed his MD thesis, 'the significance of phenylketonuria in Australia' and in 1963 moved to Sydney as Senior Specialist at Prince Henry Hospital in the school of psychiatry established by Leslie Kiloh, who encouraged his interest in aboriginal mental health with populations locally and later in Central Australia. Collaborating with Malcolm Kidson, Ivor Jones and others, he was powerfully influenced by the work of Alexander Leighton in developing the shortstay psychiatric field team approach. John published broadly and across disciplines with some of his most interesting papers in anthropological journals. His intellectual curiosity and pragmatism is exemplified by his approach to understanding subincision among Western Desert populations. John Cawte formally retired in 1990, the year he was made an Officer in the Order of Australia.

592,Catching the visitorâ€™s interest,"Some dioramas are more attractive to museum visitors than others. These dioramas catch the visitors' interest and make them stop and look closer. Such situational interest is essential for learning as it can hold the visitors<e2><80><99> attention and render them open to accommodate new knowledge. A study was conducted in three German natural history museums with diorama galleries to find out which specific features in dioramas support the development of situational interest by attracting visitors and encouraging focused observations and continued curiosity. Interest was determined using different methods in combination: observation of visitors during their visit to the diorama galleries, post-visit interviews and children<e2><80><99>s drawings after they had viewed the gallery. The data show that the dioramas vary hugely in how successful they are in catching and holding the attention of visitors and that the development of situational interest depends on the quality of subjective experiences and the immediate emotional feedback during the visit. The reasons for such responses are manifold as visitors differ from each other in relation to their individual interests, backgrounds, experiences or preferences. Nevertheless, if a diorama provides a variety of anchor points enabling visitors to relate their previous experiences and knowledge to the scenes or artefacts presented, viewing this sort of diorama result in visitors feelings of enjoyment, involvement, and stimulation which are the most typical emotional aspects of an interest-based activity. <c2><a9> Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015","Scheersoi, A",0,10.1007/978-94-017-9496-1_12,445
593,A study of the literacy practices of rural farm male adolescents,"Concerns have been expressed about assessment results that report girls outscoring boys on standardized achievement testing in reading and writing and boys outscoring girls in mathematics and science. This study explored how Western Canadian rural farm boys understand and practice multiple literacies in their everyday lives and what it means for them to be <e2><80><98>literate<e2><80><99> in today's world. The research was a qualitative ethnographic study of the culture of six rural farm boys. Thick description was used to explain the event and the context of the event. The fieldwork involved collecting print and digital artifacts that depicted the boys' literacy practices and conducting interviews and conversations. The boys lead very literate lives. However, their notions of what literacy is are rooted in the ideas of literacy as a technical skill and literacy as school knowledge. The boys, who did not see themselves as readers, engaged in transactional reading and writing outside of school, motivated by personal and group interests and by a curiosity to learn knowledge about the world in which they live, a need to be with their peers, and a desire to build social capital in their settings. The boys used literacy to do the social work of gender, of defining themselves, and of placing themselves in their families and peer groups and among their schoolmates with a gendered identity. A gender-based disconnect in reading and writing activities has emerged from our schools. If we want students to embrace school-based print literacy and to make it part of their lives, then competence is simply not enough. Educators must find ways to help students discover pleasure in reading and writing well by offering them assignments and opportunities to recognize that what brings them pleasure is connected to experience, competence, and challenge. The chasm between school literacy and literacy for personal purposes demonstrates the need for curriculum designers to find ways to utilize the digital mode of communication. Curriculum writers must begin to view literacy as a social practice rather than as a set of technical skills so that these rural male adolescents can see themselves as literate people.","Kelly, Brenda",0,,446
595,Escaping the dark side of curiosity,"Curiosity as a clinical entity has been a neglected subject in the psychoanalytic literature. Freud never addressed the issue of curiosity systematically. His interest was in trying to account for children's sexual questioning. Nevertheless, hinderance to internal curiosity - this is to say, that which intimidates and abates the appetite for an exploration of one's motives - is part and parcel of psychoanalytic inquiry. And, arguably, there is no greater clinical challenge for the analyst than trying to treat an analysand who appears to lack an interest in the underlying causes of his unhappiness. The problem of impeded self-inquiry is usually exacerbated in people with more serious emotional disturbances. My position here is that in studying the conditions that mitigate against curiosity in a seriously disturbed patient, we gain access to an enlarged version of the curiosity problems of our less disturbed patients. Here I interpret my clinical impressions about problems with curiosity with ideas from the writings of Martin Buber and Albert Camus.","Goldberg, C",0,10.1023/A:1015133312320,447
596,Shifting views and building bonds: Narratives of internationally adopted children about their dual culture,"American literature on international adoption suggests that adoptees' pride in the culture of their birth country improves their self-esteem and helps them to cope with experiences of racism. Parents are therefore encouraged to teach their adopted children multicultural skills to improve their psychological well-being. French psychologists, on the contrary, suggest that adoptees should feel fully members of their adoptive country and families. These practices shed light on the respective multicultural and universalist paradigms in the US and France. Few papers, however, consider the opinions of adoptees. This study explores internationally adopted children raised in France and their spontaneous curiosity about their birth country. The present study used semi-structured interviews with 19 adoptees aged 8<e2><80><93>18 years old, to explore their attitudes towards the culture of their birth country. Transcripts of recorded interviews were analyzed according to interpretative phenomenological analysis. While there was striking consistency of interest in birth countries, adoptees' expression of curiosity varied across time. Children described distinctive goals: knowing more about their history, finding relatives, becoming a multicultural citizen, or simply helping people. Their parents' involvement was thus seen as helpful, but adoptees stress the need to feel ready and may prefer independent ways of learning about their birth country. Adoptees' multiple feelings of belonging derive not only from multicultural training but from a lifelong construction of self. Professionals and parents may need to adapt to adoptees' individual development, distinctive time frames, and ways of learning to provide better support to them. <c2><a9> 2018, <c2><a9> The Author(s) 2018.","Benoit, L and Harf, A and Sarmiento, L and Skandrani, S and Moro, M R",0,10.1177/1363461518764250,448
597,Guess You Like: Course Recommendation in MOOCs,"Recommending courses to online students is a fundamental and also challenging issue in MOOCs. Not exactly like recommendation in traditional online systems, students who enrolled the same course may have very different purposes and with very different backgrounds. For example, one may want to study ``data mining'' after studying the course of ``big data analytics'' because the former is a prerequisite course of the latter, while some other may choose ``data mining'' simply because of curiosity. Employing the complete data from XuetangX(1), one of the largest MOOCs in China, we conduct a systematic investigation on the problem of student behavior modeling for course recommendation. We design a content-aware algorithm framework using content based users' access behaviors to extract user-specific latent information to represent students' interest profile. We also leverage the demographics and course prerequisite relation to better reveal users' potential choice. Finally, we develop a course recommendation algorithm based on the user interest, demographic profiles and course prerequisite relation using collaborative filtering strategy. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs much better than several baselines (over 2X by MRR). We have deployed the recommendation algorithm onto the platform XuetangX as a new feature, which significantly helps improve the course recommendation performance (+24.6% by click rate) comparing with the recommendation strategy previously used in the system.","Jing, Xia and Tang, Jie",0,10.1145/3106426.3106478,449
598,Activities May Have Intrinsic Drives,"This chapter is adapted from Columbia University lectures: Dynamic psychology, 1918 (New York: Columbia University Press) pp. 67-71, 104. We have seen that some activities are due to tissue conditions. Other activities may be due to general motives, such as desire for security, for recognition, and so on. Here R. S. Woodworth proposes a third source of motivation. It is his thesis that many activities, regardless of the original motive which initiated them, become intrinsically interesting. The question is whether the thousand and one things which the human individual has the capacity to do are themselves wholly passive, requiring drives outside of themselves, or whether each such activity can be directly aroused and continue in action without assistance from hunger, sex, self-assertion, curiosity, and the rest. Now, of course, it must be admitted that sometimes mechanisms are operated by extrinsic motives. With respect to activities of the more intellectual sort, drive comes especially from such motives as those of self-assertion, curiosity, and construction. The point at issue is very well brought out in the case of a game of skill. The motive that drives the chess player to his chess, or the golf player to his golf, is not at all adequately accounted for by referring to an undifferentiated reservoir of curiosity or manipulativeness. The one is driven precisely by an interest in chess and the other by an interest in golf.

605,Review of Aggression in the sports world: A social psychological perspective,"Reviews the book, Aggression in the Sports World: A Social Psychological Perspective by Gordon W. Russell (see record 2008-02637-000). The book presents a well-constructed summary of the reams of academic literature in this domain, approaching the subject matter from multiple angles, and in a way that engages the reader's interest. Written in an informal, conversational style, this text is easy to follow and would suit both an informed and uninformed audience. In summation, Aggression in the Sports World offers a unique insight into issues that would commonly provoke interesting discussions among sports-minded individuals by providing research findings which, at times, both support and refute popular hypotheses. To conclude this review, it is only fitting to satisfy the curiosity of those readers who pondered the answers to the questions posed at the start of this piece. Research findings cause us to conclude that measuring a man's finger length ratio, which is the difference in the length of his index finger relative to his ring finger, rather than his testosterone levels, would be a better way to predict the tendency for him to be physically aggressive.

An ExpandED Schools Resource Guide,"This paper reports on the findings from the STEM Educators Academy, an ExpandED Schools initiative where classroom teachers and after-school educators engage in joint professional development at premiere science institutions, then work together back at their schools to teach maker-design projects that spark student interest and cultivate curiosity in STEM subjects. The Academy was piloted in 2013-14, serving 200 students in five New York City public schools with the New York Hall of Science as a cultural partner. Each of the five schools developed a co-teaching team comprised of one classroom teacher and two after-school community educators. In 2014-15, the STEM Educators Academy expanded to 12 schools with 15 teams in total, serving 640 students, and The Institute of Play joined the Academy as a new cultural partner. In 2015-16, the Academy expanded to serve 1,500 students in 23 schools with 25 teams and added the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum as a partner. This paper describes key findings from an evaluation of the 2014-15 Academy: (1) The quality of STEM activities increased over the course of the year; (2) STEM Educators Academy programs surpassed national norms for quality; (3) STEM Academy educators increased their confidence; (4) Educators need additional support to incorporate opportunities for reflection and relevance in STEM learning; and (5) Teachers and community educators need support to find and use planning time effectively.

Recent research suggests that metacognitive judgments about the extent to which one knows something influences whether curiosity is aroused, curiosity's phenomenology, the intensity of curiosity states, and curiosity's motivational impact on information seeking behavior. Tip-of-the-tongue judgments arouse curiosity aimed at the reduction of cognitive conflict, stimulate more intense state curiosity, and motivate more information seeking behavior, whereas Don't Know judgments are associated with feelings of interest, activate lower levels of state curiosity and motivate less information seeking behavior.

What is a psychoanalytic process and how do we know when one is taking place? Psychoanalysis Comparable and Incomparable describes the rationale and ongoing development of a six year programme of highly original meetings conducted by the European Psychoanalytic Federation Working Party on Comparative Clinical Methods. The project comprises over seventy cases discussed by more than five hundred experienced psychoanalysts over the course of sixty workshops. Authored by a group of leading European psychoanalysts, this book explores ways for psychoanalysts using different approaches to learn from each other when they present their work to fellow psychoanalysts, and provides tools for the individual practitioner to examine and improve his or her own approach. As described in detail in its pages, sticking to the task led to some surprising experiences, raising fundamental questions about the way clinical discussion and supervision are conducted in psychoanalysis. Well known by many in the psychoanalytic community and the object of much interest and debate, this project is described by those who have had the closest contact with it and will satisfy a widely held curiosity in psychoanalysts and psychotherapists throughout the world.

614,From MOOCs to Micro Learning Activities,"Mobile devices are omnipresent in our daily lives. They are utilized for a variety of tasks and used multiple times for short periods throughout the day. MOOC providers optimized their platforms for these devices in order to support ubiquitous learning. While a combination of desktop and mobile learning yields improved course performances, standalone learning on mobile devices does not perform in the same manner. One indicator for this is the mismatch between the average usage pattern of mobile devices and the time to consume one content item in a MOOC. Micro learning builds on bite-sized learning material and focusses on short-term learning sessions. This work examines the potential of micro learning activities in the context of MOOCs. Therefore, a framework for video-based micro learning is presented, which features a personalized curriculum. Videos are suggested to the user in a non-linear order that is determined by content dependencies, users' preferences and watched videos, as well as explicit and implicit user feedback. A mobile application was implemented to test the approach with restructured MOOC content resulting in 58 connected short videos about engineering education - e.g. web technologies and programming languages. The usage data indicates initial curiosity by the users. To improve retention rates, more user motivation will be required for future studies. A survey gathered additional qualitative feedback. While the content suggestions were seen as a vital feature for such an approach, the results showed good interest and acceptance rates to create a better learning experience for MOOCs on mobile devices.","Bothe, Max and Renz, Jan and Rohloff, Tobias and Meinel, Christoph",0,,461
617,"My psychoanalytic self: Discovery, embrace, and ongoing formation","The roots of my psychoanalytic self were established in the vibrancy and texture of my family of origin and the culture that surrounded us as I grew up in my home city of Chicago. Those early influences, unbeknown to me as particularly formative for my identity as a psychoanalyst until my mid-20s, included abiding intellectual curiosity, pursuit of academic excellence in college and beyond (my mother's side of the family) and/or dedication to skilled crafts (my father's side of the family). Those highly motivated and focused folks pursued their professions and trades with vigor, purpose, and joy. In addition, there was lots of singing, piano and saxophone playing, and poetry recitations, often in Latin by my maternal grandmother. My identical twin sister and I, and our many first cousins in our large extended family were clearly expected to follow suit, particularly in the academic track, and all of us did so! There were many encouragements along the way-the good example provided by our elders and their particular and persevering interest in the development of our minds, shown by a great readiness to engage us in discussions of family life and history, community and world issues. We were expected to be interested in such matters, to have answers to their questions and to have some questions of our own. There was a great emphasis placed on thinking, and deeply. Feelings and their importance were also recognized, but more as context and backdrop, not so much spoken or elaborated.

Unspecific pleasure without differentiation of degrees of complexity, comprehending aspects of figural novelty, was related to low degrees of parental control and to intensive parental stimulation of aesthetic interest and behavior, curiosity, and exploration. Pleasure in specific aspects of figural novelty and complexity and dislike of simplicity and regularity was related to lack of support of the child's independence, low degrees of parental control and expectancy of achievement, and to stimulation of aesthetic interests and behavior.

620,"""An easy switch"": A descriptive case study exploring the shift toward informational text accompanying the implementation of Common Core State Standards in five primary classrooms","The purpose of this descriptive case study was to discover how the newly implemented Common Core State Standards (CCSS) may have changed teachers' practices and philosophies regarding literacy instruction and to determine which teaching strategies were being presented in regard to informational text in the studied Kindergarten through second grade classrooms. The research was conducted in five classrooms within one elementary school in the mid-Southern United States. The study design involved semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, and teacher-reported lesson plans over a fourteen week data collection period. The aim of this research was to portray a vivid description of the implementation of CCSS and the subsequent changes to the teaching of literacy, with a focus on the increased use of informational text. The outcome of this study was portrayed through a flowchart which emerged from the data using grounded theory during the final step of data analysis. The key findings from this study were discovered in two areas: (a) change in the classroom and (b) teachers and informational text. It was discovered that (a) teachers will shift their way of teaching if they perceive a positive change in their students, (b) in order to change, teachers must receive support and then provide specific supports to students, and (c) if teachers receive support but do not carry this over into student support, there will not be a noticeable change in their teaching. The result of this classroom change was that the teachers in this study acknowledged that children's curiosity enables teachers to choose informational text for instruction. This was recognized as the easiest part of the switch to CCSS. The teachers also discovered that young students can appropriately utilize informational text for learning and can then transfer that learning to other content areas. It was anticipated that these authentic descriptions could further understandings on the process of teacher change and bring new insight for those schools considering an increased focus on informational text with young children. The findings confirmed theories presented in other research within the areas of teacher change and informational text interest to support the reading development in young children.

621,"INTEREST, PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, AND LEARNING","This article discusses the importance of studying interest and reviews research on the association between interest and prior knowledge. It is concluded that there is a substantial linear relationship between interest and prior knowledge. Previous findings of minimal interest-knowledge relationships were attributed to one, or more, of the following: (a) Knowledge and interest measures reflecting different content, (b) questionable reliability or validity of the measures, (c) ideographic assignment to high/low groups introducing error into group assignments, (d) use of materials not suited to the sample, and (e) possible confounding of interest and knowledge measures. Research suggests that working on interesting, compared to neutral, materials may engage deeper cognitive processing, arouse a wider, more emotional, and more personal associative network, and employ more imagery. A model of the interest-knowledge relationship is updated, and suggestions for further research are made. Finally, the similarity between interest and curiosity is explored, and the advantages of research on these constructs are discussed.","TOBIAS, S",0,10.2307/1170745,465

This article discusses this rationale for connecting students' communication experiences in and out of classrooms to foster relevant literacies needed in contemporary society. Next it identifies common literacy principles, textual structures, and reader processes that print advertisements and content area texts. It then explains an analytic method called Deep Viewing, which consists of three levels--literal observation, interpretation and evaluation/application--that can be applied to both types of texts. The following code categories that guide viewers through interpretive and applied/evaluation levels of Deep Viewing are described: sequence and structure; semes and forms; language and discourse; proximity and spacing; culture and context; and effects and production. Twenty-two additional classroom activities to connect and extend students' literacies are offered. Finally, the benefits of connecting literacy principles, textual structures, and reader processes through the use of print advertisements and academic texts are discussed. These include: (1) students demonstrate high levels of motivation, interest, and social interaction; (2) following initial analysis, new critical insights are fostered during subsequent readings of academic texts; (3) student curiosity may be sparked, which can lead to self-initiated learning; and (4) students are assisted in forging cohesive understandings and developing sound literacy strategies for all modern media and communications environments.

625,Water rights and legal pluralism: Beyond analysis and recognition,"One important reason to embark upon the effort to compile this book was to bridge the felt gap between the analysis of water rights and the assumptions and practices of intervention. On the one hand, academic anthropologists criticize water professionals for overly simplifying the water world and for not recognizing its socioeconomic, cultural, and legal diversity. On the other, more inter- vention-oriented water professionals find detailed analyses of the existence of plural legal situations of little direct use for designing water management systems and policies. All chapters in this book combine, to a greater or lesser extent, academic curiosity with a commitment to change, thus providing testimony that legal pluralism is no longer a mere hobbyhorse of legal anthropologists. Even if not all the contributing authors explicitly engage with questions of change, all of them somehow relate to wider policy debates. Some chapters are clearly written from a wider concern with a law-related social or developmental problem, and engage in a critical analysis of the existence of plural legal conditions, without searching for ready-made solutions. Thus, the analyses by Bhu- shan Udas and Zwarteveen (chapter 2), Getches (chapter 3), and Roth (chapter 4) contribute to deepening the understanding of the role of law and lawmaking in different settings. In contrast, van Koppen and Jha (chapter 9), Bruns (chapter 10), and Meinzen-Dick and Pradhan (chapter 11) more directly address those who are in a position to implement or devise policies and laws. Van Koppen and Jha describe legally plural conditions in South Africa in the context of governmental efforts to create and implement socially more equitable water distribution policies and laws. Bruns's chapter can be read as an attempt by a concerned social scientist to come to terms with the gaps and tensions between neoinstitutionalist and sociolcgal approaches to water problems by using the concept of transaction costs. In a similar manner, Meinzen-Dick and Pradhan embed their social concerns about equitable and just water allocation mechanisms in clear water policy terms and contexts. In this concluding chapter on legal pluralism and water control, we want to further address the question of the implications of insights about legal pluralism for water policy making and interventions. As we noted in the first chapter, translating academic insights about the coexistence of various legal and normative water frameworks into neat policy recipes carries with it the risk that legal pluralism may become yet another tool in support of basically centralist social engineering. This risk of simplification is intrinsic to the tension between scientific analysis for the sake of improving understanding and research work with an interventionist focus. Analyses belonging to the first group increasingly acknowledge complexity and contingency, and have come to accept the limits of manageability as a fact of life and as a basic starting point of further analysis. Such acceptance becomes more difficult for policymakers and higher-level water managers, whose legitimacy depends on their own and others' trust in their regulating and managing powers, and in getting their plans to bring about progress and systematic improvements accepted. To make policies and laws, a degree of simplification is unavoidable. How simplifications come about, however, is not a given. Many chapters illustrate how specific legal and policy abstractions work to render specific interests or groups more visible than others, how the scope for planned change is often exaggerated, and how routes to alternative solutions are banned from (and at the same time also by) public and professional discourse. Acknowledgment of the existence of plural legal and normative conditions entails making sense of complex interactions between various normative and legal frameworks that are not easily amenable to forms of technical, social, and legal regulation. Roth (chapter 4), for instance, shows how the norms, rules, and practices associated with the subak are difficult to marry with those associated with state-initiated WUAs. Indeed, the process of gaining acceptance and legitimacy for centrally devised rules and rights is likely to be full of tensions, often pitting the different parties against each other in long-winded negotiations and struggles. These take place within and through wider power differences that may either work against or in favor of legal intentions. Getches (chapter 3) provides clear examples of the limited value of formal legal recognition and protection of the water security of Indians in the United States, if these are not backed up with political and economic power. In their analysis of legal regulation of groundwater use, Prakash and Ballabh (chapter 8) show how the political and economic clout of those with best access to groundwater (and who are most culpable of depleting the resource) make it difficult for the state government to undertake any meaningful legal action. Similarly, the chapter by Bhushan Udas and Zwarteveen (chapter 2), and the one by van Koppen and Jha (chapter 9), suggest that well-intended laws and policies can, by themselves, achieve little in terms of social justice in societies that are characterized by histories of deeply embedded social inequities. What all these chapters suggest is not only that modesty is required as regards the problem-solving capacities of intervening agencies but also that any intervention needs to take into account the ""power and politics"" of water distribution and control at both local and supralocal levels. We use the remaining part of this concluding chapter to propose some further points of reflection about translating understanding of legally plural situations to policies, laws, and interventions. In general, the public interest issues that are highest on official water policy agendas are those related to efficiency: using less water more productively is the ultimate objective of most policies and laws. Without disputing the importance of this objective, our reflections here are primarily guided by our desire to increase the visibility and discursive legitimacy of concerns about equity and social justice on water agendas. We start, in the next section, with emphasizing the contested nature of water. Water is politics, and one important implication is that academic reflections cannot objectively or neutrally guide policy making. Powers and ideologies also matter, and require explicit analytical attention. This insight runs as a red thread through the rest of the chapter, and underlies our plea for embedding any analysis of water rights and laws in a broader analysis of resource access and control. It is not just law and rights in a narrow sense that matter in structuring possibilities of water capture, but also technology, organizations, culture, economy, and ecology (see also Donahue and Johnston 1998). Thus, some form of interdisciplinarity is required. An analysis of law, of the legal and normative dimensions of water, needs to be complemented and interwoven with analyses of other dimensions. We continue the chapter with discussing the idea of recognition as the key to understanding how legally plural conditions become accepted and part of policies and laws. Who recognizes, and what is recognized? We start with distinguishing between cultural recognition, the recognition of social and cultural diversity in ways of managing and controlling water, and material recognition or redistribution, which more directly relates to the question of how water is allocated and distributed. In our opinion, recognition of plural legal conditions should not be limited to the first, the acceptance of cultural plurality and diversity, but should also deal with the second, a fair distribution of water and other resources. One cannot assume the actual manifestation of linkages between the two, as some national water laws do, but these linkages require investigation. We end the chapter arguing that responsibilities of recognition do not lie just with those with formal powers of legislation and policy making. Recognition is shaped by a process of dialogue and social struggle, in which many actors with different perspectives, interests, and powers are involved.

630,Whaleback ships and the American steel barge company,"The whaleback ship reflected the experiences of its inventor, Captain Alexander McDougall, who decided in the 1880s that he could build an improved and easily towed barge cheaply by using the relatively unskilled labor force available in his adopted hometown of Duluth, Minnesota. Captain McDougall's dream resulted in the creation of the American Steel Barge Company. From 1888 to 1898, the American Steel Barge Company built and operated a fleet of forty-four barges and steamships on the Great Lakes and in international trade. These new ships were considered revolutionary by some and nautical curiosities by others. Built from what was then a high tech material (steel) and powered by state-of-the-art steam machinery, their creation in the remote north was a sign of industrial accomplishment. In Whaleback Ships and the American Steel Barge Company, Roger C. Pellett explains that the construction of these ships and the industrial infrastructure required to build them was financed by a syndicate that included some of the major players active in the Golden Age of American capitalism. The American Steel Barge Company operated profitably from 1889 through 1892, each year adding new vessels to its growing fleet. By 1893, it had run out of cash. The cash crisis worsened with the onset of the Panic of 1893, which plunged the country into a depression that mostly halted the ship-building industry. Only one shareholder, John D. Rockefeller, was willing and able to invest in the company to keep it afloat, and by doing so he gained control. When prosperity returned in 1896, the interest in huge iron ore deposits on the Mesabe Range required larger, more efficient vessels. In an attempt to meet this need, the company built another vessel that incorporated many whaleback features but included a conventional Great Lakes steamship bow. Although this new steamship compared favorably with vessels of conventional design, it was the last vessel of whaleback design to be built. Whaleback Ships and the American Steel Barge Company objectively examines the design of these ships using the original design drawings, notes the successes and failures of the company's business strategy, and highlights the men at the operating level that attempted to make this strategy work. Readers interested in the maritime history of the Great Lakes and the industries that developed around them will find this book fascinating. <c2><a9> 2018 by Wayne State University Press.

631,Exploring to learn visual saliency: The RL-IAC approach,"The problem of object localization and recognition on autonomous mobile robots is still an active topic. In this context, we tackle the problem of learning a model of visual saliency directly on a robot. This model, learned and improved on-the-fly during the robot's exploration provides an efficient tool for localizing relevant objects within their environment. The proposed approach includes two intertwined components. On the one hand, we describe a method for learning and incrementally updating a model of visual saliency from a depth-based object detector. This model of saliency can also be exploited to produce bounding box proposals around objects of interest. On the other hand, we investigate an autonomous exploration technique to efficiently learn such a saliency model. The proposed exploration, called Reinforcement Learning-Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity (RL-IAC) is able to drive the robot's exploration so that samples selected by the robot are likely to improve the current model of saliency. We then demonstrate that such a saliency model learned directly on a robot outperforms several state-of-the-art saliency techniques, and that RL-IAC can drastically decrease the required time for learning a reliable saliency model.

632,TOWARDS A RESPONSE-ABLE PEDAGOGY ACROSS HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN,"Internationally there has been some interest in how critical pedagogies might be enabled in higher education to support transformative social agendas. Few writers, however, have theorised the ethico-political aspects of this effort from a feminist new materialist perspective. By focusing on the analysis of an inter-institutional collaborative course which was constructed across three disciplines and two differently positioned universities in Cape Town, South Africa, this paper examines the design of the course retrospectively from a feminist new materialist theoretical framing. In so doing, it moves beyond more traditional understandings of critical pedagogy to consider the design and student engagement with the course from the perspective of what we call ``response-able pedagogies.'' Response-able pedagogies are not simply examples of the type of learning that can take place when power relations, materiality and entanglement are acknowledged; they also constitute ethicopolitical practices that incorporate a relational ontology into teaching and learning activities. We propose that ethico-political practices such as attentiveness, responsibility, curiosity, and rendering each other capable, constitute reponse-able pedagogies. The paper focuses on the transdisciplinary and interinstitutional course to consider how these ethico-political practices which constitute a response-able pedagogy might (be put to) work and how the students were both enabled and constrained by this design in terms of their responses to such ethico-political practices.","Bozalek, Vivienne and Zembylas, Michalinos",0,10.17159/1947-9417/2017/2017,474
637,"SUSTAINABLE FOOD: AN EDUCATIONAL PROPOSAL, FOR KEY STAGE 3 IN SECONDARY","In 2005 the United Nations promoted the ``decade of education for sustainable development'' (20052014) and the UNESCO Italian Committee instituted the annual ``week of education for sustainable development'' to raise awareness about the necessity of a fairer and more respectful future for both human beings and environment. Nevertheless, the Italian Guidelines for the Curriculum in Secondary School - Key Stage 3 (2012 Edition) do not include the topic ``sustainable food''. Whereas, as proved by the scientific research, human activities concerning food, its production, its transportation, its consumption and waste discharge are one of the most important causes of environmental pollution, it is important to raise awareness and to understand which teaching methods might be the most effective for increasing debate, interest and willingness in order to promote environmental safety. It is fundamental to build an ecological conscience, especially in tomorrow's citizens: today's children. The purpose of this study is to verify the opportunity to introduce this topic to the students, by transmitting knowledge through the Assessment for Learning method, innovative in Italy, and by comparing it with other methods, already commonly used. This method allows students to be protagonist of their own learning; it leads them to self-assessment and to autonomous reflection; it motivates them by creating curiosity, interest and willingness to learn, in order to achieve more efficiency in learning and more probabilities of lifelong knowledge. Before starting this experiment on didactics, a survey was done. A few mathematics and science teachers from different secondary schools (KS3) were interviewed about the didactic of this ``subject'' and on the methodologies generally used in teaching. The results confirmed that in secondary schools (KS3) this topic isn't debated and that, overall, the most used methodologies are lectures and school trips. Therefore, the didactic experiment with the Assessment for Learning went on and the results were positive. Indeed, not only the students achieved better marks than the other students who had been explained the same topic by lectures and active techniques, but they were also more interested and motivated and, even more important, not one single student failed the final test (as a result of the responsible group work carried out during the lessons). Furthermore, during the lessons the students spontaneously gave their contribution with practical proposals, aimed at minimizing the environmental impact problem. In conclusion, this study, conceived as a first test for the applicability of the Assessment for Learning method in Italian schools, shows at least the importance of organizing, in future, a didactic project based on this new methodology in science teaching, in order to consider, in perspective, a wider application field.","Necca, I Zandonella and Tamino, G and Santovito, G",0,,475
638,Understanding early research experiences through the lens of connected learning,"This paper examines the early research experiences of eighteen researchers from a variety of scholarly fields to identify key factors in effective, successful experiences. Applying thematic analysis to semi-structured interviews, and using the Connected Learning framework as a lens to examine early research experiences, we identify three factors that are common in successful experiences: exposure to key events early in researchers' lives, mentorship from a variety of sources that proactively connects early researchers to opportunities and models support, and experiences that prompt curiosity and joy, sparking the interests of those who go on to become researchers. This work has implications for the design of early research experiences and demonstrates how connecting youth to research opportunities early in their learning allows them to pursue their interests, build relationships with mentors/mentees, and access opportunities to develop as researchers and critical thinkers.

642,"The Fifty States Project: Learning about America, One Care Package at a Time","This article introduces the fifty states project, a year-long study of the United States that uses crowd sourcing to bring authentic materials into the social studies classroom. The project started five years ago, when author Kelly McPherson decided that she wanted to have a care package sent from all 50 states to help students learn about the nation. McPherson knew that if the students could touch, smell, and taste artifacts from each state, those experiences would help students remember what they learned. ""Whether the artifacts being examined relate to popular culture or social history, they illustrate the stories of individuals and groups and can be vehicles to stimulate interest. Artifacts stimulate students' curiosity and help them focus on social studies, providing them with something concrete that they see and touch and serving as a springboard for students' questions."" Over the years, McPherson has solicited the help of friends from all over the country to collect some fantastic artifacts and make social studies come alive for her students. Their experiences with the care packages are often meaningful and help them relate to the world outside of school, making this a great example of authentic learning. The learning goals of the fifty states project include: (1) learning the location of each state; (2) important facts and dates in its history; and (3) its culture, resources; (4) industries; and (5) memorable facts. Students will be able to compare and contrast the information that they learn about new states with their knowledge of their home state as well as infer and draw conclusions about borders, regions and other commonalities. They will also make connections with people they have never met and places they have never been.","McPherson, Kelly",0,,480

The aims of this study were to (1) discover the reasons foreigners seek this type of experience; (2) define what an ayahuasca experience entails; (3) discover subjective perceptions of ayahuasca<e2><80><99>s benefits and risks; and (4) describe personality styles of participants using the personality questionnaire (PSSI). Participants (N<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>77) were persons who had travelled to South America to use ayahuasca. Among the most frequent motivations were curiosity, desire to treat mental health problems, need for self-knowledge, interest in psychedelic medicine, spiritual development, and finding direction in life. Frequently mentioned benefits included self-knowledge, change in the way one relates to oneself, spiritual development, improved interpersonal relations, overcoming mental and physical problems, and gaining a new perspective on life. Stated potential risks included lack of trust in the shaman or organizer, inaccurate information provided by the shaman or organizer, and exposure to dangerous situations. PSSI results showed that people using ayahuasca scored significantly above the norm on the scales of intuition, optimism, ambition, charm, and helpfulness and significantly lower on the scales of distrust and quietness. <c2><a9> Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Kavensk<c3><a1>, V and Simonov<c3><a1>, H",0,10.1080/02791072.2015.1094590,481

Exploratory behaviour in pigs may reflect appetitive foraging motivated by hunger, or appetitive behaviour related to other motivations, such as nest building. However, exploration may also be motivated by curiosity, stimulated by novelty or search for novelty. The aim of this study was to test novel methods of evaluating exploratory motivation in sows around farrowing and during lactation.

646,HOW CAN WE MAKE CITY? PARTICIPATORY STRATEGIES,"The question How can we make city? initiates the pedagogical process of the teaching innovation carried out in the subject Urban Development Management and Control of the third academic year of the Grade of Building Engineering of the University of Seville. This teaching innovation aims to transform the traditional teaching model into a new one based on participatory strategies. The innovation was carried out during the academic year 2014-2015. From two improvement cycles, it is possible to establish guidelines to apply lessons learned in the development of the teaching of future academic years. The first improvement cycle is focused on the instrumental knowledge of town planning and its real application in Andalusian municipalities. On the other hand, the second improvement cycle comprehends analysis and practical implementation of the knowledge and skills acquired, by means of the study of a piece of news connected with town planning. The experience developed starts from the analysis of previous teaching activity and subject contents. The first step consists of answering questions such as: what is the essential of the subject?; what is the complementary of the subject?; how is the subject structured?; what relations are indispensable to give sense to the essential contents identified?; how do we build relations between contents?; how can we organize the sequence of contents?; how do we learn?; what steps are required to acquire an autonomous, deep and collaborative knowledge?. All preceding questions invite us to reflect on our teaching experience. Furthermore, in our teaching innovation activities, these questions are taken as the initial element of the development of the pedagogical process. Hence, sessions developed in class are based on asking questions and the learning process is supported by the development and presentation of projects. The activities carried out in class pursue the following goals: the reconnaissance of the elements that define the city; the establishment of connections between urban landscape, city and town planning instruments; the identification of urban areas; and, finally, the search of a better understanding of the urban reality through town planning instruments. The learning process methodology begins with the formulation of a global question, that has to be able to provoke in the students curiosity and interest for its solution and for the search of answers. This initial question is permanently present and sets a reference for different approaches of the problem solution that may arise in class. Therefore, contents are developed through questions. These questions are connected with specific projects, so that students can learn specific concepts in the context of a concrete reality. The construction of a suitable working environment in class becomes essential to foster collaborative work; thus students can ask themselves questions, share doubts, advances and progress with their peers. The global questions asked should be able to be divided in smaller queries, facilitating their study and analysis by parts. The importance of the drawing of diagrams and sketches is also highlighted in the teaching innovation experience. In summary, the teaching innovation activities proposed are focused on the implementation of alternative teaching methods from the traditional ones in order to allow students to learn in an autonomous, deep and collaborative way.]","Herrera Martin, J A and Montes, M V",0,,483
647,Teachers' and parents' conceptions of children's curiosity and exploration,"Although curiosity is a characteristic often observed in young children, it has not received much academic interest in recent years. Among its many dimensions, the epistemic nature of curiosity, or the quest for knowledge, deserves attention. To explore the potential application of <e2><80><98>epistemic curiosity<e2><80><99>, it is important to understand how lay conceptions complement theoretical conceptualizations. As people who are significant in organizing children's environment, how teachers and parents view curiosity is essential to how they will respond to the manifestation of this characteristic in children. A questionnaire was developed to examine teachers' and parents' conception of children's curiosity and exploratory behavior and whether they value this characteristic. The participants of this study were preschool teachers and parents with a preschool-age child. The findings indicated that the participants have a positive view toward curiosity and exploration and that teachers are more willing than parents to encourage this characteristic in young children. A factor analysis indicated that teachers' and parents' conceptualization of curiosity is multi-dimensional, showing some similarities with theoretical conceptualization. <c2><a9> 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Chak, A",0,10.1080/09669760701288690,484

650,Stories in the making: A phenomenological study of persistent women techmakers in co-ed community makerspaces,"Technology shapes the world, and collaborative learning environments known as makerspaces offer tremendous opportunity for innovation and invention. Co-ed community makerspaces lack female membership and participation. If women do not participate, they are being left behind; therefore, there is a need to understand female techmakers who persist in co-ed community makerspaces. This study was viewed through the socio-political conservative feminist framework. It aimed to explore why the participants were attracted to co-ed makerspaces; challenges and barriers they encountered and how they overcame them; and supports and strategies used to persist in co-ed community makerspaces. This study may interest current and future female techmakers and anyone seeking increased female participation in co-ed makerspaces. This study utilized a qualitative existential-phenomenal research design. The researcher interviewed 6 persistent women techmakers who were long-term members of co-ed community makerspaces. The interviews were conducted both face-to-face and virtually using a semi-structured interview protocol consisting of 3 primary questions and 10 as-needed follow-up questions to elicit candid accounts of their lived experiences as female techmakers in co-ed community makerspaces. Five conclusions resulted from this study. First, natural tendencies such as extraordinary curiosity and natural attraction to electronic technology played an important role in the participants' attraction to techmaking. Second, the participants were attracted to their makerspaces because they offered meaningful personal connections. Third, inadvertent sexism existed in the participant's makerspaces but not oppression. Fourth, the participants were self-determined. Fifth, early supports and role models inspired or helped the participants in their techmaking pursuits. This study's findings yielded three recommendations. First, the researcher recommends that adults encourage and support extraordinarily curious children. Second, educational policy and curriculum around makerspaces should include talking points to highlight meaningful social interactions as an attraction point. Finally, the conservative feminist framework has value when unpacking male and female social relations in male-dominated fields and should be taught more widely in the area of technology.

653,A descriptive study of intrinsic motivation in three California accredited model continuation high schools,"Purpose: The first purpose of this study was to identify and describe teachers' perceptions of intrinsic motivation in classrooms among at-risk adolescent students in 3 model continuation high schools. The second purpose of this study was to identify and describe teacher practices that promote intrinsic motivation among at-risk adolescent students in 3 model continuation high schools. The third purpose of the study was to identify and describe evidence of intrinsic motivation among at-risk students outside of the classroom in 3 model continuation high schools. Methodology: This was a descriptive study of 3 model continuation high schools in Southern California. Data were triangulated from 4 methods of data collection: focus group interviews of teachers, individual structured interviews of teachers, observations in classrooms, and archival data gained through structured interviews with principals. Findings: There were 23 participating teachers who commonly identified that evidence exists of literature-based variables of intrinsic motivation in their classrooms, specifically self-determination, curiosity, feelings of competence, interest in tasks, recognition, autonomy, challenging tasks, sense of purpose, and satisfaction. Teachers identified indicators of intrinsic motivation in classrooms, and those indicators were validated in 21 classroom observations. Similar strategies for promoting and sustaining intrinsic motivation were shared by teachers in all 3 continuation schools. High levels of caring, interest, passion, and commitment in teaching at-risk adolescent students transcended similarly among teachers across the 3 model continuation high schools, as found in the researcher's observations and teachers' individual interviews. The principals' responses to interview questions, archival data, and the researcher's observations revealed that the at-risk adolescent students voluntarily and actively participated in extracurricular activities, attended school at an optimum rate, graduated at a higher rate, and voluntarily participated in various school activities. Conclusions: Across the 3 model continuation high schools, there were high levels of teacher engagement, caring, and principal support that created communities of support for the at-risk adolescent students to be intrinsically motivated in achieving their academic goals. The role of leadership (principals) in these 3 model continuation high schools made a significant impact outside the classroom in encouraging students to be intrinsically motivated to attain their academic goals.

654,The Vintage Photograph Project,"Background: Placing artwork in hospitals and creating art have been shown to help children cope with the stress of hospitalization. The Vintage Photograph Project combined passive and active arts engagement for an intervention that explored hospitalized children's interest in and responses to restored vintage photographs. Methods: This descriptive study included a convenience sample of 20 hospitalized children, ages 5-18 in the United States. Drawing accompanied a one-time interview. Results: The photographs were of interest to all participants. Subject matter and feelings drove the child's choice of favorite photograph. Responses to the photographs were incorporated within five themes: (1) exploring the unfamiliar, (2) seeking the familiar, (3) seeing something cute, (4) finding something funny and (5) liking what they saw. The act of drawing promoted conversation and social interaction; generated humor and stories of family, friends and pets; and resulted in artwork for an interesting hospital art exhibition. Conclusions: Findings suggest that restored vintage photographs are a subject of interest to hospitalized children and are worthy of consideration for comparison studies to determine their potential as positive distractors for hospitalized children. Study methods that incorporated vintage photographs provided an enjoyable and therapeutic intervention for children and their families.

655,Types of interactions in science museum class visits,"Exhibitions in science museums stimulate conversations and collaborative learning in different ways. This chapter describes a research method that aims to analyze various types of interactions in relation to these exhibits. Since the museum setting is strongly socio-culturally mediated, the theoretical framework is based on socio-cultural theory, which emphasizes social interactions and stresses the importance of cultural symbols as essential elements in meaning-making. Types of interactions can describe the collaborative learning in class visits to museums, and defined here as: individual, collective and multiple 'zones of interaction'. The zones are centered on a single exhibit that encourages interpersonal or intrapersonal interaction. The individual zone occurs when only one student manipulates the exhibit; the collective zone occurs when two or more students share their experience regarding the exhibit; and multiple zone describes a situation in which two or more separate zones occur at the same time and both are centered on the same exhibit. Since learning in museums is mainly interest-driven, this method further characterizes the collaborative learning within the three zones of interaction through evaluation of expressions of curiosity. These expressions of curiosity are manifested in technical, emotional and intellectual ways. In order to elucidate the implementation of the suggested method to study interactions at museums, this chapter presents a study utilizing the framework to evaluate class visits to a science center. Two class visits of eighth graders were observed and videotaped, focusing on student-student and student-adult interactions. The framework suggested in this chapter enables an innovative method for investigating exhibits-centered collaborative learning involving the different types of interactions in science museums. <c2><a9> 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

656,"James Madison, law student and demi-lawyer","We think of James Madison as a political theorist, legislative drafter, and constitutional interpreter. Recent scholarship has fought fiercely over the nature of his political thought. Unlike other important early national leaders - John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, Edmund Randolph, James Wilson - law has been seen as largely irrelevant to Madison's intellectual biography. Madison, however, studied law and, at least in one extant manuscript, took careful notes. These notes have been missing for over a century, and their loss contributed to the sense that Madison must not have been that interested in law. Now located, these notes reveal Madison's significant grasp of law and his striking curiosity about the problem of language. Madison's interest in interpretation is certainly not news to scholars. These notes, however, help to establish that this interest predated the Constitution and that his interest in constitutional interpretation was an application of a larger interest in language. Moreover, Madison thought about the problem of legal interpretation as a student of law, never from the secure status of lawyer. Over his lifetime, he advocated a variety of institutional approaches to constitutional interpretation, and this comfort with nonjudicial interpreters, along with a peculiar ambivalence about the proper location of constitutional interpretation, may owe a great deal to his self-perception as a law student but never a lawyer.

657,Sexual Interest and Expression,"Although most people associate sexuality solely with adolescence and adulthood, infants and children are developing sexual beings, and they express natural interest and curiosity about their sexuality. Many adults, including parents and educators, find it difficult to accept and to allow expression of childhood sexuality, to communicate with children about sexuality, and to provide a supportive and developmentally appropriate environment for children. As a result, many children may associate the negative feelings of shame, guilt, embarrassment, fear, and helplessness with sexuality. To help prepare educators, school psychologists, and other mental health professionals, this chapter discussed the controversies that ensue in this area and presented the normal developmental progressions of children's sexual interest from infancy through late childhood. Problem areas were described and were differentiated as ""normal"" behaviors that others are having negative reactions to and ""abnormal"" behaviors, often a consequence of sexual abuse. School psychologists and other mental health professionals in schools are in a key position, through prevention activities, to recognize children as sexual persons, to educate adults and children about sexual development, and to promote honest, accurate, and open communication about sexuality among parents, educators, and children. They also can evaluate concerns about children's sexual interest and expression and recommend and provide appropriate interventions. The goal is to support and promote practices that allow children to feel confident, competent, accepting, and responsible about their sexuality. To be effective, school professionals must be knowledgeable, comfortable, approachable, and willing to enter a controversial area.

659,An empirically derived classification system for juvenile firesetters,"Despite the heterogeneity of juvenile firesetters, the literature lacks empirically based classification systems. Existing typologies have been descriptive, arbitrarily segregate subtypes based on univariate characteristics, and lack empirical validation. In the present investigation, cluster analysis was used to develop a classification of juvenile firesetters based on both fire-specific and general individual and environmental variables associated to firesetting severity and recidivism. Participants included 240 firesetters aged 4 to 17 and primary caretakers who were referred to The Arson Prevention Program for Children. Findings indicate that juvenile firesetters are a heterogeneous group that can be empirically separated into conventional-limited, home-instability-moderate, and multi-risk-persistent firesetters. These subtypes differ on fire-specific characteristics, individual and environmental variables, and firesetting recidivism and general outcome. The implications of this classification system for conducting fire-risk assessments and implementing prevention and treatment strategies are also discussed.

First, my curiosity as to how Cassirer<e2><80><99>s thought may prove its worth in helping to dissolve contemporary epistemological dead-ends; second, my long-time involvement with cave art studies and cave art; third, implicitly, my own doxological approach to contemporary theory of knowledge.1 I will try to achieve this combination by briefly presenting what I see as two major problems within the study of cave art: first, the ubiquitous urge for an origin and, second, what I am going to call the mimetic curse in cave art studies; I will then proceed to show that Cassirer<e2><80><99>s ideas about symbolic forms and, more specifically, his philosophy of technology may help us to dissolve these problems, focusing mainly on his concept of <e2><80><98>organ-projection<e2><80><99> and on the notion of symbolic forms understood as ever-changing ways to produce human reality; finally, I will comment upon the topicality of both Cassirer<e2><80><99>s thoughts and of cave art.

661,Homo Curious: Curious or Interested?,"This review aims to clarify four perennial issues surrounding the concept of curiosity: its nature, conceptual distinction from situational interest, types, and educational implications. First, we argue that humans have evolved to be deeply curious to adapt to a world of uncertainty. Curiosity can be likened to an appetite for knowledge which can be satiated by specific information that fills a knowledge gap. Information-seeking behavior is determined by the expected availability of information using a cost-benefit analysis. Second, although curiosity and situational interest are often considered synonyms, we show that the two constructs differ in terms of their theoretical account, biological underpinnings, triggering factors, emotional valence, specificity of information searches, and relationship with individual interest. Unlike situational interest, which is the positive affect triggered by a wide variety of sources (e.g., autonomy, relatedness, competence), curiosity is an aversive cognitive state caused by an information gap. Situational interest follows the hedonic principle and is associated with opioid liking system in the brain. Curiosity, by contrast, is understood through drive theory and involves dopaminergic wanting system. Situational interest drives individuals to approach the stimulus while curiosity promotes the active seeking of missing information. Iterative cycles of curiosity resolution can lead to the development of individual interest. Third, we introduce two types of curiosity: curiosity for what (forward curiosity) is provoked by unpredictability, whereas curiosity for why (backward curiosity) arises from incongruity. Finally, driven by the unique characteristics of curiosity, we suggest ways to design learning environment that can nurture students' curiosity.","Shin, Dajung Diane and Kim, Sung-il",0,10.1007/s10648-019-09497-x,496
662,Revenge--The hate that dare not speak its name: A psychoanalytic perspective,"My interest in the topic of revenge and my subsequent two-year, virtually full-time immersion in writing this essay had their conscious origin in the reading of Laura Blumenfeld's memoir, Revenge: A Story of Hope (2002). That more than intellectual curiosity was driving my exploration would not become clear to me until the essay's near completion. In her book Blumenfeld describes a train of events that began when her father, then a rabbi visiting in Israel, was shot during the Intifada by a Palestinian gunman. Eventually she goes to Israel, where, using her journalistic credentials and connections, she gains access first to the family of the gunman, by then imprisoned, and later to the man himself. By the book's end, however, enormous transformations have occurred at all corners of this unique triangular relationship. Blumenfeld and the gunman's family can begin to see each other as complexly human individuals, less distorted by the stereotyping projections that dominated the images of each in the mind of the other. And so, engrossed by Blumenfeld's book, I undertook to learn what I could about revenge and its status within psychoanalytic thought and practice.

Confirmatory Factor Analysis revealed a good fit of the data to the two-factor model of the Self-Curiosity Attitude-Interest Scale in Italian and Colombian subjects (respectively, x2(13) =16.073, p =.245 and x2(13) =10.352, p =.665). Also, Measurement Invariance Analysis suggested equivalent factor structures (Configural Invariance, x2 (26) = 26.423, p =.440) and factor loadings across the two groups (Metric Invariance, x2 (31) = 34.242, p =.315). The results do not support scalar invariance (x2 (38) = 82.058, p &lt;.001). Data suggest concurrent validity of the Self-Curiosity Attitude-Interest in the Colombian group, welding evidence for the scale application in the Colombian context. In conclusion, the results posit that the two-factor model of the Self-Curiosity Attitude-Interest Scale is adequate in Colombia; the psychological construct of self-curiosity is conceived similarly in Colombia and in Italy, and the scale has expected correlations with other relevant psychological constructs. <c2><a9> 2018 Fundaci<c3><b3>n Universitaria Konrad Lorenz.","Durosini, I and Fantini, F and Ram<c3><ad>rez, C D E and Rodr<c3><ad>guez, A M R and Richter, M F J and Aschieri, F",0,10.14349/sumapsi.a2018.v25.n1.1,498
668,The wisdom of coaching: Essential papers in consulting psychology for a world of change,"This book is organized into four sections. My coeditor, Richard C. Diedrich, has written brief introductions and summaries for each that introduce the articles. The first section contains articles that focus on definitions, history, and research on executive coaching and the commentaries that accompanied each of the issues of the journal. The second section pulls together the articles that emphasize conceptual approaches to executive coaching and contains the thinking of many of the finest practitioners in the field. The third section encompasses the articles that focus on specific challenges facing coaches, methods that can be and are used in coaching engagements, and the issue of standards of practice in the field. The final section provides all of the major case studies that have appeared in the Consulting Psychology Journal (CPJ) over the last decade or so. On the surface, it would appear that there are three major ways that any reader could approach this material. First, you could simply read it from cover to cover and address the material in each article as it appears. Second, you could browse your way through the volume, selecting articles that appeal to your curiosity or interest. Finally, you could strategically identify particular issues or problems in executive coaching that you are facing at any particular time and dive into the relevant material. Regardless of how you choose to work your way through the book, I think you will agree with me by the end that you have greatly expanded your knowledge of the field, appreciation for the depth and scope of thinking and practice that appear in these articles, and gratitude that the authors took the time to collect and express their thoughts on paper.

671,Helping Your Child Learn Math with Activities for Children Aged 5 through 13,"This booklet is one in a series on different education topics intended to help parents make the most of their child's natural curiosity and become an integral part of reaching the National Education Goals as set forth by the President and governors in 1990. The book suggests ways that parents can generate interest in mathematics in children aged 5-13. Three initial sections discuss ideas parents need to consider when working with their children. Concepts discussed include the importance of mathematics, parents' and students' attitudes toward mathematics, the meaning of being a mathematics problem solver, communicating mathematics, and how to use the book. Twenty-six activities are presented that incorporate games, problem solving, and hands-on experiences to teach mathematical concepts. The activities are divided into three categories: (1) Math in the Home (e.g., money match, name that coin, treasure hunt); (2) Mathland: The Grocery Store (scan it, get into shape, weighing in); and (3) Math on the Go (e.g., license plates, number search). Topics covered in the activities include: measurement, estimation, probability, computation, fractions, data collection and representation, graphing, and geometry. Each activity includes three parts: purpose, material needed and ""what to do."" Appendices provide suggestions to support a positive mathematics environment in the local school, a sample from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics'""Curriculum and Evaluation Standards,"" and a list of over 50 supplementary resources for parents and children.

674,Factors influencing the range of information in ESP experiences,"A large number of spontaneous cases from the Duke Case Collection was examined for evidence of some principle which could account for their range of subject matter. Many experiences concerned crises involving persons to whom the E-person was emotionally attached. On that account the main emphasis of the study was to see the extent to which anxiety, conscious or unconscious, could have been a factor. All the cases used were of one classification, the realistic form, which is characterized by detailed imagery. They included both contemporary and precognitive types. These cases were examined to see the range of relationship between the experiencing person (E-person) and the target person or event (T-person), and to see the importance of the occurrence to the E-person. The persons most closely concerned in the various relationships were: (1) the E-person himself, (2) those persons in his immediate circle, (3) those in remote relationships, and (4) strangers. The importance of events was roughly estimated under headings (A) Death, (B) Accident, (C) Other Important Events, (D) Trivial Events. Although the number of cases in (1) was second only to (2), over 1/4 of all still fell into (3) and (4). Cases involving a crisis for the T-person (mainly A and B) made up only a little over 1/2 the total, while more than 10% were about D. Anxiety might have been the cause of experiences concerning critical topics involving the E-person himself or those in his immediate circle, but it could not explain those involving strangers or unimportant topics on any level of relationship. For these at least, an influence as broad and general as simple interest in, and curiosity about, the world in general seems indicated.

676,"""The Work Preference Inventory: Assessing intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientations"": Correction","Reports an error in the original article by T. M. Amabile et al (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1994[May], Vol 66[5], 950-967). Items 5 and 11 in Table 1 appeared in the incorrect column. The correct version of the table is provided. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record 1994-35880-001.) The Work Preference Inventory (WPI) is designed to assess individual differences in intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientations. Both the college student and the working adult versions aim to capture the major elements of intrinsic motivation (self-determination, competence, task involvement, curiosity, enjoyment, and interest) and extrinsic motivation (concerns with competition, evaluation, recognition, money or other tangible incentives, and constraint by others). The instrument is scored on two primary scales, each subdivided into 2 secondary scales. The WPI has meaningful factor structures, adequate internal consistency, good short-term test-retest reliability, and good longer term stability. Moreover, WPI scores are related in meaningful ways to other questionnaire and behavioral measures of motivation, as well as personality characteristics, attitudes, and behaviors.

677,Dimethyltryptamine (DMT): Subjective effects and patterns of use among Australian recreational users,"Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an endogenous hallucinogen with traditional use as a sacrament in the orally active preparation of ayahuasca. Although the religious use of ayahuasca has been examined extensively, very little is known about the recreational use of DMT. In this study, Australian participants (n = 121) reporting at least one lifetime use of DMT completed an online questionnaire recording patterns of use, subjective effects and attitudes towards their DMT use. Smoking DMT was by far the most common route of administration (98.3%) with a comparatively smaller proportion reporting use of ayahuasca (30.6%). The reasons for first trying DMT were out of a general interest in hallucinogenic drugs (46.6%) or curiosity about DMT's effects (41.7%), while almost one-third (31.1%) cited possible psychotherapeutic benefits of the drug. An increase in psychospiritual insight was the most commonly reported positive effect of both smoked DMT (75.5%) and ayahuasca (46.7%), a finding that is consistent with other studies examining the ritualised use of ayahuasca in a religious context. Although previous studies of DMT use have examined ayahuasca use exclusively, the present study demonstrates the ubiquity of smoking as the most prevalent route of administration among recreational DMT users.

Originally concerned with saving our systems from the tempestuous vagaries of extreme weather conditions, who could blame those of us living in the moderate climes of Western Europe - never having to worry about anything more than a bit of heavy rain - putting disaster recovery on the back burner? With all that rain, there was never enough to make a flood (well, not until the rain forests started disappearing in earnest). When we read about businesses recovering from hurricanes, volcanoes, typhoons, tornadoes, avalanches and earthquakes, it was more out of casual interest than learned curiosity, I mean, Ireland and the UK just don't experience these climatic phenomena.

682,"Travel literature, the new world, and locke on species","This paper examines the way in which Locke's deep and longstanding interest in the non-European world contributed to his views on species and their classification. The evidence for Locke's curiosity about the non-European world, especially his fascination with seventeenth-century travel literature, is presented and evaluated. I claim that this personal interest of Locke's almost certainly influenced the metaphysical and epistemological positions he develops in the Essay. I look to Locke's theory of species taxonomy for proof of this. I argue that Locke uses evidence gathered from the non-European world to (1) show that in taxonomizing objects we rely on their sensible qualities rather than their real essences and to (2) undermine Scholastic Aristotelian views about a mind-independent species/genera structure to the world.","Connolly, P J",0,,507
684,The role of intrinsic motivations in attention allocation and shifting,"The concepts of attention and intrinsic motivations are of great interest within adaptive robotic systems, and can be exploited in order to guide, activate, and coordinate multiple concurrent behaviors. Attention allocation strategies represent key capabilities of human beings, which are strictly connected with action selection and execution mechanisms, while intrinsic motivations directly affect the allocation of attentional resources. In this paper we propose a model of Reinforcement Learning (RL), where both these capabilities are involved. RL is deployed to learn how to allocate attentional resources in a behavior-based robotic system, while action selection is obtained as a side effect of the resulting motivated attentional behaviors. Moreover, the influence of intrinsic motivations in attention orientation is obtained by introducing rewards associated with curiosity drives. In this way, the learning process is affected not only by goal-specific rewards, but also by intrinsic motivations. <c2><a9> 2014 Di Nocera, Finzi, Rossi and Staffa.","Nocera, D D and Finzi, A and Rossi, S and Staffa, M",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00273,508
687,INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES IN EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR IN THE 2ND YEAR OF LIFE,"For children in their second year, exploration is an inherently social phenomenon with fundamental implications for learning about the animate and inanimate world. This article examines how 15-month-old children spontaneously involve their mothers in their exploration of a novel task in an unstructured setting. Forty-six 15-month-olds were presented with a novel exploration task with their mothers present but uninvolved. The task consisted of a box with 15 clear plastic drawers each containing a novel toy. Types of bids to mothers, children's effect, and exploratory behaviors were coded. In the absence of active maternal cues, 15-month-old children quickly and frequently involved their mothers in their exploratory efforts, and at least half of the bids were accompanied by positive affect. Active bids to mother (walking or extending a toy) were associated with more manipulation of novel toys, whereas passive bids such as looking were related to less active exploration of toys and more visual inspection of the task stimuli. Furthermore, the earlier any type Of bid to mother, the quicker children approached novel toys. Finally, there were notable sex differences both in children's bids to their mothers and in their approach to the task. While exploring, girls made more active bids for physical contact with their mothers. On the other hand, girls spent more time than boys visually examining the box itself without touching, but boys spent more time than girls exploring and touching the box. These results are discussed in terms of how mothers and children mutually contribute to children's interest in novel exploration.","MAYES, L C and CARTER, A S and STUBBE, D",0,10.1016/0163-6383(93)80035-7,509
688,Moving Beyond Fun: Evaluating Serious Experience in Digital Games,"Games are normally considered to be ``fun'', though recently there is growing interest in how gameplay can promote empathy and encourage reflection through ``serious experience''. However, when looking beyond enjoyment, it is not clear how to actually evaluate serious experience. We present an evaluation of four games that were submitted to a student game design competition; the competition challenged teams to design a game that inspired curiosity around human error and blame culture within the context of healthcare. The entries were judged by a panel of six experts and subjected to a round of play testing by twelve participants. Methods included gameplay observation, questionnaires, post-play interviews and follow-up email questions. We discuss the utility of these methods, with particular emphasis on how they enabled a consideration of the immediate and longer term impact of serious experience on players.","Iacovides, Ioanna and Cox, Anna L",0,10.1145/2702123.2702204,510
689,Dare to Be Different,"In this article, the author profiles Charles Dickens Elementary School in Vancouver, British Columbia, a school that dares to be different from the rest. This elementary school operates on a child-centered, multi-aged framework that is based on belief in an orientation towards continuous progress, appropriate evaluation of progress, schoolwide team-teaching, anecdotal reporting to parents (instead of letter grades), a collegial and collaborative working relationship between teachers and administrators, mentoring for student teachers, advocacy teams that recommend school political directions and school improvement plans, an active student council, and a parent involvement advocacy team and parent advisory council. While many individual classrooms throughout British Columbia advocate child-centered education, it is rare to find an entire school that is consistently dedicated to its principles. Having been officially designated as an ""alternative school"" by the ministry of education, Dickens Elementary has more freedom to depart from the more common mainstream practices. One example of this departure is the means of assessing student performance. Standard achievement tests have been replaced in favor of the professional judgments of teams of teachers, based on their day-to-day observations and evaluations of students' work. Teachers at Dickens remain with the same group of children for a period of three years, allowing them to get to know the students better and to become familiar with their individual learning needs and styles. The author contends that the critical force in initiating and maintaining this style of child-centered school philosophy is the teaching staff. Teachers must see the school as a place where all children can satisfy their curiosity, develop their abilities and talents, and pursue their individual interests. Because there is no ""grade-level curriculum,"" each child's learning needs are met along a continuum of progress. The anecdotal reports provided to parents are accompanied by the students' self-evaluations of their performance, who are often less generous in their appraisals than their teachers. Since Charles Dickens has been in operation for almost 20 years, there is now a history of reports about these children's subsequent performance in secondary schools. These reports indicate that the Dickens students are well-rounded, can carry on good discussions focused on the ""big ideas,"" are good leaders as well as good team players, are autonomous, flexible, personally responsible, and make good adjustments to high school. The author concludes this essay with recommendations on what is needed to allow other schools to adopt these same successful philosophies and practices: (1) ""stand-up"" leadership from principals, who must buffer the school from district and provincial demands; and (2) school boards and provincial and state authorities who are not afraid to give educators the autonomy to follow a different pathway in meeting rigorous standards.

690,Viewing Basic Math through the Lens of History: Undergraduates' Reflective Learning in a History-Augmented Mathematics Classroom,"This study is aimed at determining first-year university students' reflections when Fibonacci tiling, the ancient Chinese fang cheng procedures, and the ancient Indian meru prastara recursions were introduced as historical snippets in an adventure pedagogy for basic mathematics. Seventy-eight first-year students enrolled in a course in basic mathematics at a University in North Central Nigeria provided composite self-reports in an action research paradigm, describing their reflective learning after exposure to the historical snippets. Qualitative data reduction strategies were used to explore the students' reflections and progress in the course. The results of the study revealed that the introduction of the historical snippets aids in concretizing of concepts, spurring of behavioural engagement in learners, adding of aesthetic value to mathematics, sustaining of students attention, computational ease and effective recall of mathematical procedures. The activities of the cultural and historical augmentation were reported by participants as plays that accomplish real mathematical tasks. The outcome of this study has strengthened the belief that the history-as-a-tool style of mathematics instruction stimulates curiosity and sustains interest in students while establishing meaningful relationships between abstract ideas and practical applications in the context of the real world.","Abah, Joshua Abah",0,,512

692,Topic and Sentiment Model Applied To the Colloquial Arabic: A Case Study of Maghrebi Arabic,"Recently, the multiplication of communication and sharing platforms such as social networks, personal blogs, forums, etc., has facilitated the expression of views and opinions about products, personalities, and public policy. However, gathering these points of view is a complex task that requires resolution of many problems in different disciplines, especially issues related to our language. Among the research areas, topic modeling and sentiment analysis stimulates interest and curiosity of the scientific community. Lately, the current economic, geo-political and geostrategic trends have made researchers specifically more interested in Arabic language, except that the majority of these studies focus on the classical Arabic; nevertheless it is a language of the elites which is different from what is mainly used on the Web. Our paper focuses on Maghrebi colloquial Arabic since the little research that exists in this area is limited to East colloquial Arabic. On a corpus extracted from different Facebook pages we implemented a supervised approach to extract the sentiments, and an unsupervised approach to extract topic, then we proposed a new, semi-supervised, approach in the Arabic language that combines the topic and the sentiment in a single model, in order to join each topic to a specific sentiment.","Zarra, Taoufiq and Chiheb, Raddouane and Moumen, Rajae and Faizi Rdouan and and El Afia, Abdellatif",0,10.1145/3128128.3128155,514
693,Using Place-Based Art Education to Engage Students in Learning about Food Webs,"Integrating art into science as a means of involving students in learning about their environment offers the promise of engaging students both cognitively and emotionally. However, few studies have investigated the use of art as a learning and assessment tool in science. As such, we conducted a research study with 4th and 5th grade students at a rural school district. Our goal was to assess the impact of a place-based art and science activity on student learning about trophic levels (food webs) centered on local snakes. Activities included a lesson on trophic levels, a guided field trip to view live rattlesnakes, a native plant garden, and examples of local wildlife. Students were then instructed to paint a snake in its local environment featuring three trophic levels. Pre- and post-activity artwork and surveys were used to score student knowledge and perceptions about science, art, and local wildlife. Qualitative data was collected from focus group interviews of school administrators, teachers, and parents. We found that the students' understanding of ecosystem components improved, and they were able to transfer their knowledge and use of scientific terminology to other situations. In addition, the activity generated excitement, interest, and curiosity among the students, teachers, and parents. Thus, engaging students in place-based art experiences is useful for enhancing student understanding of trophic-level concepts and can be applied similarly to other science lessons.","Conkey, April A T and Green, Marybeth",0,,515

696,Enhancing Visitors' Interest in Science - A Possibility or A Paradox?,"Within the enterprise of science and technology centres there exists explicit aims and ambitions to enhance visitors' interest in and knowledge about science. Meanwhile, several researchers question the choice of the scientific content in exhibitions when arguing that a too unproblematic view of science commonly is presented. But how do staff members consider what scientific content to include and how this content can be organised in exhibitions? The results from interviews of staff members, responsible for planning and creating new exhibitions, suggest that they consider the scientific content of their exhibitions to a high extent in terms of organizational matters. This means that the staff members tend to not consider discussions about what aspects of science to include or exclude. Further on, the results imply that the relation between science and society risk being implicit to the visitors, whereas the aspect of scientific processes tend to be overlooked when constructing new exhibitions. The staff members express an anxiety in displaying scientific uncertainties or different models of explanations when arguing that this risks confusing the visitors. However, these aspects of science are, in the field of science education, considered crucial in order to create curiosity and interest in science. Does this mean that science and technology centres, through their eagerness to enhance young visitors' scientific literacy, risk contributing to their detachment from or unconcern for scientific issues?.","Davidsson, Eva",0,10.1007/s11165-008-9080-2,517

698,Unstable constitutionalism,"One of the most significant developments in the study of constitutional law in recent years has been the comparative turn in the field. Although debates continue over whether and how domestic courts should rely on (or even refer to) foreign law in domestic legal disputes, the appropriate methodology for comparative analyses, and the potential and limits of comparative constitutional studies, many scholars and practitioners <e2><80><93> including well-known judges <e2><80><93> no longer believe that the task of constitutional law is solely domestic in nature.Yet, despite the enthusiasm for comparative constitutional law and the emerging systematization of comparative work, the field has developed unevenly. A few countries figure in numerous studies: the United States; the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions, such as Australia and Canada; Germany; France; Israel; and South Africa. Other nations and even regions are neglected <e2><80><93> and not merely because they are small in population or have little significance for international relations. This is neither entirely unexpected nor unintentional. Some countries invariably will inform comparative queries more than others, and the jurisdictional imagination adopted by scholars and practitioners will turn on the curiosities that animate their work. The uneven development of comparative constitutional law has rendered the field only modestly comparative <e2><80><93> focusing on a few select jurisdictions <e2><80><93> rather than truly global. In particular, Asia has received less attention than we might expect. Moreover, in Asia, whereas there have been notable contributions on East Asia, rather little attention has been devoted to South Asia. In that region, India is the only country to appear in comparative discussions, but the attention here is also less than we would expect, focusing primarily on questions that are of immediate interest to the West, such as the recognition and adjudication of social rights. This lack of attention is unfortunate because South Asia is a region of vibrant if rambunctious constitutionalism. Many South Asian nations face profound social and political challenges that they seek to address within their specific constitutional traditions. A major motivation for this volume, therefore, is to include South Asia in the comparative discussion. This attempt expands the countries that currently constitute the field, and it also broadens the field<e2><80><99>s inquiries and the terms on which it is conducted. <c2><a9> Cambridge University Press 2015.","Tushnet, M",0,10.1017/CBO9781107706446.001,519

702,Personality in a communal society: An analysis of the mental health of the Hutterites,"In 1941 Joseph W. Eaton a sociologist, expert on the subject of farmers' cooperatives visited a number of Hutterite colonies in South Dakota. What he saw convinced him that the colonies presented a unique opportunity for the study of a number of significant sociological and psychological problems. With the assistance of a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health of the United States Public Health Service, Eaton organized an interdisciplinary team which included Robert J. Weil a psychiatrist, and the writers who are psychologists, in order to evaluate the mental health of the Hutterites and to relate whatever facts were discovered to the unusual cultural pattern of the group. The present volume is a report on one part of the work of this team. Early in the project we decided that the study of the personalities of an adequate sample of normal Hutterites was essential to the understanding of the relationships between cultural pattern and mental health. The culture and personality aspect of the study therefore was the subject of a great deal of our time and energies. Underlying this interest was a keen curiosity about what lay beneath the surface of the apparently successful adjustment of Hutterites to a cultural pattern which seems to subordinate the individual to the group welfare in a rather extreme way. We anticipated that in Hutterite society, with its high evaluation of collectivism, we would find a particularly illuminating example of the way in which a group insures a high degree of conformity and minimizes disrupting deviance by its members. In the personality materials we hoped to discover what the mental health consequences of such a solution were. While the projective materials yielded a picture of Hutterite personality which was inevitably incomplete and one-sided, the side which they did reveal was particularly significant. Through these tests we were able to get behind what the Hutterites wanted to tell us about themselves and learned what they probably preferred us not to know or what they themselves were unaware of. At this covert level of personality we hoped to discover the real consequences, good and bad, of living in Hutterite society.

705,Teaching young readers imagery in storytelling: What color is the monkey?,"Although mental imagery's positive role in reading comprehension is clear, the means of introducing imagery to young readers is comparatively vague. Mental imagery's very nature, being nonverbal, invisible, and often unconscious, results in a mismatch with standard instructional practices. Verbal explanations of nonverbal phenomenon fall short. External images, such as story illustrations, can discourage the creation of internal images. However, through a less-standard practice of storytelling, the author discovered a natural gateway into imagery. In contrast to read-alouds from a picture book, storytelling prompted her students' curiosity about a character's appearance. The resulting conversation led to interest and inquiry about mental imagery in general. The author documents her second-grade class's journey into the using mental imagery during reading comprehension and provides theoretical justification for this instructional approach. <c2><a9> 2010 International Reading Association.","McTigue, E M",0,10.1598/RT.64.1.6,524
706,Problems for biomedical research at the academia-industrial interface,"Throughout much of the world, universities have driven towards industrial partnerships. This collaboration, which, in the biochemical field at least, has to continue if potential benefits for patients are to be realised, has brought with it a number of problems. These include the neglect of long-term research in favour of short-term projects, the curtailing of free dissemination of research information within university departments and the biasing of results of clinical trials by the financial interests of the investigators. It is very important that governments, universities, and industry itself address these problems. Universities should monitor the amount of basic, curiosity-driven research that is being carried on, compared with that which is more short-term goal orientated. PhD students and post-doctoral fellows should be exposed to the principles of bioethics early on in their careers. Further work is necessary on the terms of research contracts to protect, on the one hand, the rights of individual scientists and, on the other, industry from rogue scientists. Where problems arise, procedures should be in place for independent reviews to be conducted by bodies such as the Medical Research Council in the UK or the National Institutes of Health in the USA. The conflict-of-interest rules recently introduced for publication in medical journals should be extended to all branches of science.","Weatherall, D",0,10.1007/s11948-003-0018-9,525
711,Review of Emotions in humans and artifacts,"Review of the book, ""Emotions in humans and artifacts"" (see record 2003-06128-000) edited by R. Trappl, P. Petta and S. Payr. For several decades artificial intelligence research was deaf to the theories and results of studies about the strict interrelation between 'rationality' and 'emotion': to emulate the behaviour of humans it was sufficient to consider their logical reasoning modes and to translate them into models. This was itself not an easy task. Methods developed in AI and HCI corresponded (and still correspond in the majority) to this attitude; for example the prevailing attention to logic, the neat distinction between 'reactive' and 'deliberative' behaviour, the time-consuming searching and planning algorithms, the focusing of usability measures on time and error rates, and stereotype-based user modelling and adaptation. Interest in emotions and affective computing is relatively new, but has been growing quickly over the last few years. Awareness of the demonstrated role of emotions in driving human behaviour led computer scientists to look with increasing interest at studies from psychologists and neurophysiologists, and to promoting opportunities for encounter and interchange with them. This book contributes to such a trend; and even the most 'rationalist' of AI and HCI researchers should have some curiosity about this domain, to verify whether the methods they have developed so far apply to this, more complex, situation. On the other hand, psychologists of various kinds who read this book (cognitive, experimental, psycho-linguists etc) might be induced to reflect on how much of their theories about the role of emotions in human-human interaction also applies to interaction with technology. This is not a handbook, but a volume aimed at describing experiences and comparing viewpoints.

712,Why Mathematics Is Essential In Biomedical Sciences Degree?,"Improvement of mathematical education and motivation of students in the mathematics' area is needed. What can be done? We introduce some ideas to generate the student's interest for mathematics, because they often present difficulties in appreciating the relevance of mathematics and its role in the health sciences. We consider that a cornerstone in the strategy to attract the students' interest is linking the mathematics with real biomedical situations. We proceed in the following manner: We first present a real biomedical situation to produce interest and to generate curiosity. Second, we ask thought-provoking questions to students as: Which is the biomedical problem presented? Which is my knowledge on this situation? What could I do to solve this biomedical situation? Do I need some new mathematical concepts and procedures? Thereupon, the teacher explains the mathematical concepts necessary to solve the case presented, providing definitions, properties and tools for graphical display and/or mathematical calculations. In this learning methodology, ICTs were cornerstones for reaching the proposed competences. Furthermore, ICTs can also be used in the evaluative task in its two possible aspects: formative and for obtaining a qualification. Comments from students about this new mathematics teaching method indicate that the use of real biomedical case studies kept the lessons in mathematics interesting. (C) 2014 The Authors.

The book addresses seminal topics such as evolution, sensation, emotion, learning, memory, individuality, love, sex, sleeping, dreaming, and religious impulses; this is a stimulating but also fairly overwhelming list, to all of which he brings an impressive array of neurobiological curiosity and research. Clear, precise, and modest language in scientific writing is often taken for granted, but as this book's awkwardness reminds us, this is not a casual or superficial custom. Sliding into hyperbole or cuteness will probably dissuade many scientists and educated readers from looking at this book, though those qualities may conceivably gain some teenage and television attention.

Though the area. has seen much progress recently (such as [10,11,5,2,1,8,6]), it is still unknown if fully-homomorphic encryption will ever become truly practical one day, or if it will remain a theoretical curiosity.

[5], which provide concrete parameters whose efficiency and security can be studied. We report on recent attempts [3,4] at; breaking FHE challenges, and we discuss the difficulties of assessing precisely the security level of FHE challenges, based on the state-of-the-art.

715,Understanding and Managing Circumscribed Interests,"The circumscribed interest is a distinct and enduring characteristic of Asperger syndrome (AS). The intensity and focus of this interest usually distinguishes children with AS from their peers. The nature and number of interests change over time, and specific triggers may precipitate a new interest. The functions of these interests range from expressing intellectual curiosity regarding the physical world to providing a source of pleasure. Parents are often concerned by how they have had to adapt their personal and family life to accommodate their child's access to the interest. However, strategies that reduce the time spent engaged in the interest or eliminate inappropriate interests are available. The interest can be either a barrier or bridge to social contact; in either case, it can also be used constructively at school and in therapy. The interests can be perceived as a problem--and will then remain a barrier--or as a talent--and will then become a bridge. Some interests can even become a source of personal success and employment.

717,Mathematical creativity and school mathematics: Indicators of mathematical creativity in middle school students,"As students progress through the educational system their interest in mathematics diminishes. Yet there is an ever increasing need within the workforce for individuals who possess talent in mathematics. The literature suggests that mathematical talent is most often measured by speed and accuracy of a student's computation with little emphasis on problem solving and pattern finding and no opportunities for students to work on rich mathematical tasks that require divergent thinking. Such an approach limits the use of creativity in the classroom and reduces mathematics to a set of skills to master and rules to memorize. Doing so causes many children's natural curiosity and enthusiasm for mathematics to disappear as they get older. Keeping students interested and engaged in mathematics by recognizing and valuing their mathematical creativity may reverse this tendency. The identification of creative potential is challenging. Prior research into the identification of mathematical creativity has focused on the development of measurement instruments. Scoring of these instruments is time consuming and subject to scorer interpretation due to the variety of possible responses. Thus, their use in schools has been very limited, if used at all, since their creation. This study seeks a simpler means to obtain indicators of creative potential in mathematics. Existing instruments, the Creative Ability in Mathematics Test, the Connecticut Mastery Tests, the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Attitude Scales, What Kind of Person are You? from the Khatena-Torrance Creative Perception Index and the Scales for Rating the Behavioral Characteristics of Superior Students were used to conduct a standard multiple regression analysis. This analysis explored the relationship between mathematical creativity and mathematical achievement, attitude towards mathematics, self-perception of creative ability, gender and teacher perception of mathematical talent and creative ability. Data were gathered from 89 seventh graders in a suburban Connecticut school. The regression model predicted 35% of the variance in mathematical creativity scores. Mathematical achievement was the strongest predictor accounting for 23% of the variance. Student attitudes towards mathematics, self-perception of their own creative ability and gender contributed the remaining 12% of variance. Interpretation of the relative importance of the independent variables was complicated by correlations between them.

722,Introduction to the history of philosophy,"The lectures of M. Victor Cousin possess an interest seldom to be met with in philosophical publications. It is certain that philosophical views and doctrines are no longer regarded, on the continent of Europe, merely as subjects of literary curiosity or of elegant entertainment. For it is well known that they excite strong emotions of sympathy and approbation, and are listened to and read with that attention and respect which is the most satisfactory evidence of a powerful conviction of their rationality and truth, by a very numerous class of intelligent and well informed young men, who may be fairly considered to represent the flower of the rising generation in their respective countries. Philosophical lectures therefore assume, on this account, an importance which is in a great measure independent of the opinions which we ourselves may form of the truth or fallacy of their contents. For although we may consider the principles which determine our own perceptions of truth, and the foundations upon which our own convictions rest, so firmly established as to be unwilling to submit them to any further discussion or examination; yet most men naturally desire to understand the spirit and to know the principles of truth, by which the public opinion of contiguous nations is influenced, and may probably be ruled, at no very distant period. Nothing therefore that is likely to influence public opinion in France can be indifferent to the people of the United States. For if contiguity can be predicated of the spirit of different nations, as well as of their local position in space, the French nation may, in the first sense of the word, be said to be nearer neighbors to the inhabitants of America, than to those of Great Britain; and besides this, the high rank among civilized nations, which is held by France, as well as the powerful influence which the spirit of France is well known to exert on the state of public opinion throughout Europe, must necessarily render the peculiar qualities and character of that spirit at any particular epoch the source of incalculable good or evil to all contemporary nations.

725,"Instructional Concepts for Occupational Education. Special Interest Paper. An Occasional Publication for Selected Audiences, No. 20","Teachers and teacher educators seem to be little aware of some major concepts about instruction that provide important insights into the central requirements for learning. A common misconception is that motivation has to do with wanting or desiring. It is instead attention to stimuli that is influenced by two powerful agents--(1) suspense, discovery, curiosity and (2) reinforcement. Introduction of new learning by the arousal and subsequent relief of curiosity is one important motivational tactic. Reinforcement for correct responses or prompt knowledge of results leads to increased student success at the task, which is the most powerful motivator for learning. Student errors can either be corrected immediately to maximize student success or planned by the instructor to result in learner annoyance or perplexity to lead him into the desired responses. Guidance or prompting should be limited to early stages of learning; confirmation of unprompted responses should characterize the vast bulk of instruction. Student behavior should be shaped through a series of successive approximations to the eventaul terminal behavior by specifying in measureable terms the standard of acceptability at each stage of learning. Explicit generalization of discrimination training, as applicable, is recommended for presenting the confusable elements present in every learning task.

735,The history of Norman Geschwind and contributions to neuropsychology,"The purpose of this biographical historical dissertation was to explore the life of Norman Geschwind, M.D., his medical career and his most clinically significant contributions in both neurology and neuropsychology. This body of literature examined Dr. Geschwind's writings from early publications through the most current research articles. Original publications of Geschwind's work were reviewed until his unfortunate death in 1984. Primary sources of literature from Norman Geschwind, M.D. included research in: cerebral dominance; hemispheric lateralization; anatomical and functional specialization of the cerebral hemispheres in humans; disconnexion syndromes in animals and man; and the organization of language and the brain. Geschwind examined other domains that included: epilepsy; the biological associations of left-handedness; the immunological associations of cerebral dominance; and left-handedness and its association with immune disease, migraine and developmental learning disorders. For this writer, Geschwind's most important exploration in clinical research was in the area of learning disabilities, specifically dyslexia. Norman Geschwind's curiosity in reading disorders has bridged behavioral neurology, developmental neuropsychology and neuropsychoeducational assessment. His book, Dyslexia: A Neurological Approach to Clinical Evaluation (1985) was his most influencing factor that triggered the curiosity for further research in this area. Geschwind's theoretical foundations and beliefs towards cerebral dominance and hemispheric lateralization are of key interest. The Geschwind-Galaburda Hypothesis was discussed and the importance of the intrauterine environment for possible future learning disabilities. Key influences that directed his course of research were also discussed. Geschwind's use of history appeared to be part of his assessment protocol. Rereading the works of earlier scientists has given Geschwind better insight into the neuroanatomical understanding of neurobehavioral disorders. Specifically, finding the roots and possible etiology of disorders can help to better diagnose and treat patients. Historically, there was a widespread tendency to reject neurologically based explanations of behavior. However, Geschwind and other researchers have addressed the possible neurological substrate of reading. Tools gained and possible future applications for treatment of dyslexia were addressed and discussed. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

736,Students' Motivation toward Learning Physical Science--A Case from Four Classes of Taiwanese Students,"The purpose of this study was to explore four classes of junior high school students' learning motivation toward a physical science course in central Taiwan. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were applied in the study. Students' physical science learning motivation questionnaire (SPSLMQ), modified from multiple dimensions of a motivation instrument (Uguroglu, Schiller, and Walberg, 1981), was developed in the study. It included achievement, affiliation, self-concept, mastery, and locus of control scales. Another questionnaire, consisting of 11 items, was designed to assess students' perceptions toward physical science. Findings from classroom observation, interviews and questionnaire surveys revealed that students think they need to take major responsibility for their own physical science learning. Although students had moderate curiosity about the nature phenomena around them, they did not persist in elaborating their understanding beyond classes, which influenced their physical science learning outcomes. Besides low mastery motivation, students also had a low score on their performance in physical science. Many students' reasons for learning physical science were related to instrumental interests such as knowing more information, preparing for tests, or for attending better schools. Students expressed that having low-pressure learning contexts and lab experiences could motivate them in learning. They agree that teachers' teaching can influence their motivation in learning. Suggestions for science teaching are discussed in the paper. (Contains 30 references.) (Author/ASK)","Tuan, Hsiao-Lin and Chin, Chi-Chin",0,,542
737,Effect of Inquiry-Based Mathematics Activities on Preschoolers' Math Skills,"Practice: An Inquiry-Based Mathematics Activities Module (IBMAM) was developed in accordance with the developmental characteristics, interests, needs, and expectations of preschoolers. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of the IBMAM on preschoolers' numbers and operations skills. A quasi-experimental method, which was a pretest-posttest design with control group, was used. The students of a kindergarten were randomly assigned to three groups: experimental, control, and placebo. Measurements were made on the three groups before and after the IBMAM. The study took place in the academic year of 2016-2017, and the sample consisted of 57 students (19 participants in each group) of a kindergarten in Sincan, Ankara, affiliated to the Ministry of National Education. Interviews were conducted with 18 kindergartens in the same district for the needs analysis. The kindergarten was the study field of choice due to its sufficient number of students and low socioeconomic status and to the students' willingness to participate in the study. Math activities were performed in three classes with children 60-72 months of age. For 6 weeks, the experimental group performed the 30-activity IBMAM, the control group performed no activities, and the placebo group performed Turkish reading activities unrelated to mathematics (TRAUM). Data were collected using the Test of Early Mathematics Ability (TEMA-3). In the current study, 3x3 (three groups: experiment, control, placebo groups with 3 measurements: pretest, posttest, follow up test) experimental mixed design (factorial-split-plot) ANOVA was performed to determine the effect of IBMAM on preschoolers' math skills. Research Findings: Results show that the IBMAM had a positive and lasting effect on preschoolers' number and operations skills. IBMAM provided the experimental group participants with the opportunity to be engaged in small-group activities in which they were able to have math experiences and inquire about them. This process allowed them to enhance math concepts, learn new ones, and learned in meaningful ways in which they used their math skills. They structured the concepts and skills that they had learned by inquiring, researching, and experiencing, which promoted their curiosity and interest in learning.","Karademir, Abdulhamit and Akman, Berrin",0,,543

740,GREAT MASTERPIECES IN TEACHING ENGLISH TO 2ND GRADERS,"The purpose of this article is to present some teaching methods and strategies in assessing child's improvement in learning English based on cross-curricular teaching. Using Art in teaching English, starting already at the early stage of primary school proves how effective and valuable it is for child's improvement in long life learning. By integrating classical masterpieces of the great world-known artists in teaching English, we focused on Diego Velazquez, a Spanish painter from the 17th century and his masterpiece Las Meninas (The Ladies-in-Waiting). In the years of teaching, according to the methods of convergent pedagogy and integration of English language in the school subjects, different activities were provided to enhance higher order thinking skills. Finding new ways in teaching children how to express their feelings and give opinions improves their ability of giving suggestions and making arguments in evaluation of their work during the learning process. A teacher in the role of an assistant provokes pupils to get involved in taking part in the learning process, from planning to assessment, drawing attention to self-evaluation. It is worthwhile to discuss with pupils to exploit their interests and potentials in learning about the world through Art to satisfy children's needs, curiosity, imagination, creativity and self-esteem. It is believed that a cross-curricular approach of teaching is an excellent method for the child's independence in searching her / his own ways to gain the knowledge of a new language and to build up good communication competences for the future situations.","Pokorny, Karmen",0,,546
741,Student motivation in co-operative groups: Social interdependence theory,"Motivation is reflected in the effort individuals commit purposely to strive to achieve goals they perceive as being meaningful and worthwhile. Motivation is aimed at achieving goals, it is fuelled by emotions, and it has social origins. Motivation, therefore, may be seen as occurring within the context of social interdependence. The motivational system promoted within co-operative situations includes the value and meaning of the goals being promoted through striving for mutual benefit, seeing the ability to achieve the goal being based on joint efficacy, intrinsic motivation, high epistemic curiosity and continuing interest in achievement, high commitment to achieve, and high persistence. The motivational system promoted within competitive situations includes the value of the goal being determined by differential benefit, seeing the ability to achieve the goal based on differential efficacy, extrinsic motivation to win, low epistemic curiosity and a lack of continuing interest to achieve, a relative lack of commitment to achieving, and relatively low task persistence by most individuals. The motivational system promoted within individualistic situations includes the value of the goal being determined by self-benefit, seeing the ability to achieve the goal based on self-efficacy, extrinsic motivation to meet pre-set criteria of excellence, low epistemic curiosity and continuing interest to achieve, relatively low commitment to achieving, and relatively low task persistence by most individuals.

745,Children's scientific curiosity: In search of an operational definition of an elusive concept,"Although curiosity is an undeniably important aspect of children's cognitive development, a universally accepted operational definition of children's curiosity does not exist. Almost all of the research on measuring curiosity has focused on adults, and has used predominately questionnaire-type measures that are not appropriate for young children. In this review we (a) synthesize the range of definitions and measures of children's curiosity and (b) propose a new operational definition and measurement procedure for assessing and advancing scientific curiosity in young children. In the first part of the paper, we summarize Loewenstein's (1994) review of theoretical perspectives on adult curiosity, and critically evaluate a wide range of efforts to create and implement operational measures of curiosity, focusing mainly on behavioral measures of curiosity in children. In the second part, we return to Loewenstein's theory and present an argument for adopting his "" information-gap"" theory of curiosity as a framework for reviewing various procedures that have been suggested for measuring children's exploratory curiosity. Finally, we describe a new paradigm for measuring exploratory curiosity in preschool children, defining curiosity as the threshold of desired uncertainty in the environment that leads to exploratory behavior. We present data demonstrating the reliability and validity of this measure, discuss initial results on developmental differences in young children's curiosity, and conclude with a general summary and suggestions for future research. <c2><a9> 2012 Elsevier Inc..","Jirout, Jamie J. and Klahr, David",0,10.1016/j.dr.2012.04.002,549
746,Running head: Online and ttraditional student differences,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the differences in demographic characteristics, motivational orientation, self-efficacy, and attitudes about technology between students who enrolled in a course offered in the traditional setting and those enrolled in the same course online. The two groups, each comprised of 27 students, were administered self-report measures to evaluate their levels of technological self-efficacy, attitude toward technology, and motivational orientation. Participants also reported their age, number of online courses taken, and gender. Results indicated that the two groups did not differ in terms of their attitudes about and feelings of self-efficacy toward technology. Despite many similarities in motivational orientation, online students did report higher levels of interest, curiosity, and intrinsic motivation, suggesting that students in online courses may prefer autonomy in the course design. Further research is necessary to determine whether students seek out online courses because they possess motivation or if online courses create motivation.","Stevens, T and Switzer, C",0,,550

750,Pro bono and the corporate legal sector in India,"Introduction This chapter is the first qualitative empirical study of pro bono practices of elite corporate law firms in India in a global context. I collected and analyzed data on five major aspects: the range of pro bono work and other socially oriented initiatives; their shared understanding of the term pro bono; the institutionalization of pro bono; the perceived advantages of doing pro bono work; and the factors limiting the amount of pro bono at these firms. It is important to analyze the surveyed law firms<e2><80><99> responses to these questions against the backdrop of the specific regulatory, historical, economic, and sociocultural milieu of India to understand the dialectical complexity of the interaction between global and local forces, which leads to the distinctively Indian vision of pro bono and socially oriented practices at these law firms.This study focuses on elite corporate law firms because they are more exposed to global forces relative to other parts of the Indian legal profession and pro bono work has become an important and increasingly institutionalized part of global corporate law firm culture, especially in the United States and the United Kingdom, raising the question of how India has received that culture (Cummings 2004). Moreover, Indian corporate law firms have recently experienced quite spectacular growth, thereby spiking greater interest in their activities. In light of this, and the paucity of studies relating to it, there is a great deal of curiosity about the various aspects of Indian law firm pro bono practice as compared with that of global law firms.The survey responses provide interesting findings. First, globalization has had an important effect on the culture of pro bono practices at Indian corporate law firms. In particular, the globalization of knowledge and practices is manifest in a gradual move toward institutionalization of pro bono at most surveyed law firms, as well as in the recent emergence of matchmaking organizations (both domestic as well as foreign) that seek to connect practitioners with people who need legal advice, such as social entrepreneurs, public interest organizations, and nonprofit organizations. Second, the external notion of pro bono is not received in a vacuum in India. <c2><a9> Cambridge University Press 2017.","Gupta, A",0,10.1017/9781316585207.008,553
751,Gamification in education: A methodology to identify student's profile,"This paper presents a methodology to identify the students' gamification profiles for educational projects. Gamification is the application of game elements and game principles in non-game contexts. We propose a process to identify profiles in gamification through the use of ludic activities and gamification driven questionnaires. The choice of activities follows some information of the target audience, such as: age range, cell phone use, internet access and other data. The use of questionnaires is necessary to cross-check the activity data, analyze data and identify the resulting gamification profile. The proposed methodology consists of six steps process: making a baseline, defining core drivers, defining activities, preparing a questionnaire, planning data collection, and analyzing data. The purpose of the process is to identify which gamification core drivers (the motivations) may be most effective in attracting students' attention. Gamification is a powerful tool to attract students. Also, a good gamification rise their interest up to learn and caught attention for a long period of time. A good gamification educational project will produce a very attractive educational game. The resulting game will motivate students to do something different: to study in a new way. We used Yu Kai-Chou's Octalysis framework to identify and model the student profile. The final gamification project is also an Octalysis model. The Octalysis framework is based on basic human motivations according to eight core drivers, which are: Epic Meaning & Calling, Development & Accomplishment, Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback, Ownership & Possession, Social Influence & Relatedness, Scarcity & Impatience, Unpredictability & Curiosity and Loss & Avoidance. Finally, in order to test and evaluate the methodology, we applied the whole process on four classes of two different public schools. The 98 students are from different ages and different grades (7th to 10th grades). The results indicate the process is useful to identify the students' gamification profile, the activities and the questionnaires provide a good data set to identify the core drivers and the resulting gamification project clearly depicts the final profile. <c2><a9> 2017 IEEE.","Freitas, S A A and Lacerda, A R T and Calado, P.M.R.O. and Lima, T S and Canedo, E D",0,10.1109/FIE.2017.8190499,554
752,An Examination of the Key Factors that Impact the Gender Gap in Reading,"This dissertation was designed to provide information on the factors that impact the male gender gap in reading. Disparities between the reading achievement of boys and girls have long been a concern for educators. There are many reasons boys are lagging behind in reading such as the lack of male role models, stereotyping, lack of interest in reading material, and differences in brain development in boys and girls. Peer pressure also plays a role in the reading success of boys and reading may be considered a feminine activity. Another reason boys do not perform well in reading is their great need for physical movement on a regular basis. Students and teachers in three elementary third-grade classrooms were given a reading motivation survey. The constructs of the survey include reading efficacy, reading challenges, reading curiosity, reading involvement, the importance of reading, reading work avoidance, competition in reading, recognition for reading, reading for grades, social reasons for reading, and compliance. The 10 teachers also participated in an interview conducted by the researcher. An analysis of the data revealed there was no significant difference in reading motivation between boys and girls. The data also showed that the reading motivation score had no impact on the end-of-grade reading score. In the teacher interviews, there were several factors teachers felt impacted the reading scores of boys. The lack of male role models and the classroom behavior of boys were two of the factors that were mentioned most often when talking with teachers about the reading performance of boys.

The question was how to use the media facade to communicate a broad urban issue in a friendly, site-specific way. Exploring the theme of Belo Horizonte's public transport, the participants developed an urban signage system that transmits, in real time, the level of occupancy of the buses passing by the media facade. Observations and interviews conducted in the area reveal that emojis were successful visual elements to attract people's interest and curiosity.

754,Curiosity About People: The Development of a Social Curiosity Measure in Adults,"Curiosity refers to the desire for acquiring new information. The aim of this study was to develop a questionnaire to assess social curiosity, that is, interest in how other people think, feel, and behave. The questionnaire was administered to 312 participants. Factor analyses of the 10-item Social Curiosity Scale (SCS) yielded 2 factors: General Social Curiosity and Covert Social Curiosity. Evidence of convergent validity was provided by moderately high correlations of the SCS with other measures of curiosity and self-perceived curiosity, whereas discriminant validity was demonstrated by low correlations of the SCS with other personality traits, such as neuroticism and agreeableness. Of interest, social interaction anxiety was observed to facilitate covert social curiosity while inhibiting general social curiosity.

756,"Pornography onÂ theÂ net: same attraction, butÂ newÂ options","Sex has come to stay on the Internet and will expand further as more people search for pornography and sexual topics that fulfill their erotic interests and needs. The young have ample opportunities to explore their sexuality through the media, either alone or together with other youths around the world. The youths who suspect or discover they are homosexual, bisexual, or have other specific sexual fantasies and urges can explore in a safe way their curiosities and sexualities, which may lead to easier self-accepting processes. Sometimes partners choose to look at pornography together but for those who keep their sexual interests hidden from their partners in fear of discomfort or disapproval the Internet offers options to fulfill their visual needs. Questions have been raised whether pornography on the Internet changes people's sexual orientation or if the net is rather a way to reach stimulation for existing sexual preferences. Another question is whether the viewing of pornography with various sexual content, e.g. sadistic content will trigger unlawful and harmful behavior outside the Internet. The Internet is a valuable source for sex research as a rich variety of human sexual behavior is represented there. Sexual minorities are not minorities any longer on the Internet. Hidden populations such as foot fetishists, individuals interested in sexual bondage, and individuals attracted to amputees openly discuss their sexual taste and are thus accessible to sex researchers. <c2><a9> 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

757,A career in child neurology: Explorations at the frontiers,"My path in child neurology, and thus this autobiography, was deliberately-and decidedly-atypical. It will be, more than most, an outline of the major issues that I was concerned with during my career. The question of intrinsic human nature was of course at the basis of the ""hard-wiring"" debate versus the tabula rasa championed by psychiatry: the idea that the brain simply was etched, and basically formed, by experience impinging on it. This latter idea could be shown to be illogical- for instance, when considering the motor system-but it held a powerful sway with contemporary Boston academics. I learned only much later that I was considered the enemy among Boston child psychiatrists of my generation for my advocacy of intrinsic (genetic) disorders of behavior. Meanwhile my own clinical observation led in a new direction. My continued interest in autism, and broadening clinical experience, made it evident that unlike the experience with apparent brain damage most autism was unlikely to be caused by brain damage. I have failed to describe the role our residents have had on my thinking and enjoyment of the work. I may seem to take their enthusiasm and curiosity for granted, but that is far from the truth: they are unfailingly the greatest source of vitality and eagerness to learn.

760,A life of my story,"This inquiry is based around a personal story that I originally wrote as part of an autoethnographic dissertation. I do not claim that there is anything of more interest in my storied life than in anyone else's, but this particular story made me curious. My curiosity was not about the events the story narrates, which have been wellknown to me for many years, but about the way the story appeared; the way it continues to interact with me and with others. I want, if I can, to uncover more about the life of this story. As a starting point for inquiry, I situated myself primarily in the position of autoethnographic researcher, following the approach developed and promoted by Ellis and Bochner (2000). However, in the act of writing, I have become increasingly aware that my positionality of self-as-researcher is only one of a range of selves that has been interacting with the story. These multiple selves include myself as student; myself as gay man; and myself as vulnerable human, each providing only one perspective of a narrative whole. This awareness of multiple selves has been described by Ochs and Capps, who argue that personal narratives are always apprehended by partial selves, and that such narratives can only provide a fragmentary view (Ochs & Capps, 1996). Ronai (1992) similarly observes how she has 'facets,' which are framed by a culture that demands she frames each separately from the others, but finds that no one facet is more authentic to her 'true' self than others; rather, the self exists as a dialogue between them. The interaction between my multiple selves and the story also interests me: I want to know about the extent to which the story exists as separate from my apprehending selves, like the fabled elephant being encountered by the three blind men, or whether my identity and the story are engaged in a process of co-creation, each intimately bound up with the other, to find whether, as Eakin puts it ""the self is being defined and transacted through a narrative process"" (Eakin, 1999, p. 101). <c2><a9> 2014 Sense Publishers.

They can best achieve this by setting an example through their own attitudes, by evidencing an interest in the child's intellectual growth, by manifesting faith in the child's ability, and by utilizing the child's interests in stimulating its intellectual curiosity. Close co-operation between the home and the school helps to maintain and to augment such attitudes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Voitulevich, V N",0,,562

The studies to which I am referring show that the variables that set curiosity in motion-Berlyne's specific and diversive exploration-are those that we see at work in encounters with art. What I shall argue in this chapter is that creative activities, pursued primarily for the intrinsic reward they provide, are also those mainly responsible for keeping curiosity, exploration and interest alive. Because of their complexity and evolving nature, these activities are in fact open ended. They allow for constant new connections and associations to be discovered and pursued. This makes them the very activities that provide the material for an engaging and enjoyable life. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Bianchi, Marina",0,,563
765,The Clinical Implications of Narcissistic Phenomena in Contemporary Popular Music From a Depth Psychological Perspective,"Psychologists across disciplines have examined narcissistic phenomena for over a century. Through the lenses of social constructivism and depth psychology, this dissertation illuminates the clinical psychological implications of narcissistic phenomena in American culture through an archival, phenomenological analysis of a specific cultural artifact: the lyrics of contemporary popular music. The importance of music and its critical, co-creating relationship with culture was also emphasized, and the history of narcissistic phenomena, music, and psychology were examined to lay the ground for an archival phenomenological psychological approach. An adaptation of Garza's (2004; 2011) phenomenological thematic collative procedure was performed on the lyrics of five songs selected annually (between 2009 to 2013) for their cultural significance and potential for revealing narcissistic phenomena. The procedure for analyzing the data revealed a total of 40 thematic threads that were hermeneutically reduced into five primary interrelated categories grounded in the centrality of the speaker's subjectivity. In each of the archived texts, the data revealed that the speaker was primarily engaged in a project to be above and apart from others. This project was sustained and maintained by the centrality of the speaker's subjectivity. The hermeneutically reduced, distinct, related thematic threads were referenced and further elaborated upon in a cumulative thematic narrative that disclosed the horizons of narcissistic phenomena in our culture as revealed through popular, contemporary music. A depth psychological approach illuminated and acknowledged the existential crises of narcissistic phenomena, particularly emptiness and meaninglessness, through implicitly trusting that the patient's own symptomology contains within it the rhizome of healing and wholeness, thus fostering the clinician's genuine curiosity in the patient, which in turn may allow the patient finally to foster genuine curiosity in themselves, to begin to relate with themselves, and to develop an interest in empathically relating with other human beings.

772,Understanding Commodity Character and Purchase Intention-Looking into an E-Shopping Case,"The booming growth of global internet users with immensely various types of products in display and speedy service at work has been succeeded in absorbing most consumers' attention, which in turn create huge market potentials for E-commerce activities. However, among the research works dealing with E-shopping behavior, most are interested in understanding purchase intention towards the daily ordinary consumer goods. This paper takes a different view by focusing on rarities to some specifically personal taste that has so far caught less attention in the academic field. The paper, after in-depth interviews and analysis, finds that many E-shoppers do search for curiosities and treasure to their personal interests in addition to purchasing daily goods via the internet. These E-consumer activities observed in this paper are found to exchange information both with vendors and their virtual communities, and, for these E-consumers purchase and collecting goods with rarity values through the internet, there exists a trend towards a common practice. The paper then proceeds with explanation. It argues that rarities to specifically personal values sometimes can hardly be found in stores on the street, which drives them to find the internet as an alternative. The opportunities offered by the internet to share views with the communities regarding their collections and also reinforce these consumers' intention to purchase through the internet. The point here is that the more frequent experience E-shoppers have gained, the more confidence they place on the E-vendors they have dealt with and a cumulative effect will eventually come forward. When accountability of this kind of commercial transaction is widely recognized, E-shoppers looking for goods with rarity values have more success opportunities in their search effort. The paper ends with a conclusion that among those E-shoppers to purchase daily goods, purchase intention exists when it comes to the possibility to purchase some special goods with a rarity value and personal taste.","Lin, Shu-Chiung and Chou, Andrew and Hsu, Shu-Mei and Lin, Wei-Kuo and Liu, Kuo-Shean",0,,568
773,Saladoid lapidary technology: New methods for investigating stone bead drilling techniques,Ancient lapidary traditions are frequent objects of interest and curiosity. The high degree of artistry and technical skill demonstrated by these industries worldwide is characteristic of both the Saladoid lapidary industry and the Saladoid occupation of the Caribbean (Watters 1997c). Stone beads' in particular' have played an important role in discussions of Saladoid socioeconomic systems and interaction. For example' the most frequently cited evidence for interisland movement is the common occurrence of exotic stone artifacts in Saladoid sites (Watters 1997c). In addition to the movement of raw materials' it has been demonstrated that both the local manufacture of items and import of fi nished goods occurs in Saladoid sites' and that both of these are differentially represented between islands (Crock and Bartone 1998; Murphy et al. 2000; Watters and Scaglion 1994). This has led to hypotheses of regional manufacturing centers and trade' with associated suggestions of craft specialization (Watters 1997c; Watters and Scaglion 1994). Such hypotheses have important implications for topics of interisland contact and trade' political and economic organization of production' and the Saladoid cultures. Many different lines of evidence are necessary for such broad- level questions; however' meaningful interpretation can only begin to be accomplished through specific and detailed understandings of the finer scaled participants in this production. One of the long- Term goals of our research is to work toward a detailed understanding of bead manufacture on Antigua' which would provide a basis for later comparisons with other islands. While still exploratory' our present study is an initial step toward these larger goals. This chapter continues research into the drilling technology of the Saladoid lapidary industries on the island of Antigua. The investigation focuses on the examination of manufacturing traces on the bore walls of stone beads in addition to other attributes such as bore hole shape and size. Focus is laid on drilling technology as it is one of the easier production steps to examine archaeologically; lapidary production typically does not produce large quantities of waste' and on finished beads most of the manufacturing traces have been obliterated by the final stages of bead production such as polishing. The examination of perforation methods could therefore allow one aspect of manufacture to be analyzed and compared between fi nished and partially manufactured beads. This is potentially important when comparing locally vs. off- island manufactured stone artifacts. Additionally' the drilling of the beads is usually considered the most diffi cult and technologically demanding of the steps in bead manufacture. The specific methodology we employ in our bead drilling research is based on a series of studies into Near Eastern lapidary technology in which the bore holes of cylinder seals and beads were molded' cast' and then examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Gorelick and Gwinnett 1978; Gwinnett and Gorelick 1979' 1981). The underlying rationale behind their research was that different drilling techniques (types of drills' abrasive' motion) leave distinctive traces. Through a series of experiments and comparison with archaeological examples' Gwinnett and Gorelick demonstrated that at a broad level this did seem to hold true. The microscopic examination of manufacturing traces is essentially analogous to the better- established use- wear research' with production' rather than use' the object of the analysis. Preliminary results from our trial application of molding bead bores for examination with an SEM were encouraging (De Mille and Varney 2003). Our primary objective was to establish the viability of producing replicas of bead bores' through molding and casting' that could then be analyzed for manufacturing traces. Through comparison with X- ray images taken of the beads' and SEM imaging of broken bead bores and the molds taken from them' we were satisfied enough with our ability to reproduce the bores in fine detail in molds. A second objective was to compare any features that could be seen on the Antiguan specimens with similar studies elsewhere to gain any preliminary insight into bead drilling techniques. One hypothesis gained from this comparison was that the beads examined were drilled with an abrasive (De Mille and Varney 2003). The present study further explores and validates the methodology utilized to investigate drilling techniques. We continue to experiment with molding and casting techniques. In addition' the replicability of both molds and casts for recording manufacturing traces is further explored.

774,One nation and indigenous reconciliation,"Hanson and her party believe in Australia: They believe in our common culture, in our identity as Australians, and in giving one another a <e2><80><9c>fair go<e2><80><9d>. They themselves, however, have not consistently afforded everyone a fair go, and their divisive and alienating approach to leadership is hardly conducive to the kind of national unity that they would like Australia to have. Reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians was never going to be easy. But as I seek to explain, it is possible to see how progress can been made; it is also clear that significant progress has been made. Many of us tend to assume that political correctness is beneficial to people who belong to oppressed or marginalized groups. But political correctness is unpopular, and One Nation<e2><80><99>s opposition to it undoubtedly helps to explain some of the support that they enjoy. This chapter advances three concerns about political correctness: that it is intellectually corrupting, psychologically enfeebling, and socially divisive. Correspondingly, I suggest that in the interests of genuine reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians it would be better to favor various familiar virtues, norms, and practices. These include, for example, good humor, a generosity of spirit, patience, politeness, and the kind of genuine conversation that is sustained by mutual curiosity. <c2><a9> Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Burgess, S",0,10.1007/978-981-13-2670-7_7,570
775,Engaged learning,"To generate truly compelling learning experiences and increase retention of new information, educators need the knowledge and tools to engage students from both a neurological and a humanistic perspective. Richard VanDeWeghe provides an inside look at what happens in students' minds and hearts when they are engaged and ""in the groove."" Based on Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's idea of ""flow""-a state of intrinsic control, curiosity, interest, and inquiry that is the ultimate experiential goal for learning-this book provides holistic strategies for encouraging students to become motivated, engaged learners. Teachers will find: information on brain function and memory pathways; spiritual and emotional principles of the heart that influence learning; strategies for guiding open-ended discussions, quality questioning, and teacher modeling; immediate, practical applications for language arts, science, math, and social studies; and vignettes illustrating effective teacher dialogue and classroom involvement. Engaged Learning is a clear, concise, and elegant resource that helps teachers understand what it means to be a highly motivated learner.

777,"Pro Turcis and contra Turcos: Curiosity, Scholarship and Spiritualism in Turkish Histories by Johannes LÃ¶wenklau (1541-1594)","It is still partially unexplained why, in 16th-17th-century Hungary - as opposed to Western countries - Ottoman history was not processed in an authentic and scholarly way. Why is it that intelligent Western reports of the Ottoman Empire and its history had no echo in Hungary, even though these reports wrote about, and were written to, Hungarians? This paper aims to answer the above questions when discussing Johannes L<c3><b6>wenklau, one of the most excellent 16th-century experts in the Ottomans. First we examine the three main sources used for his Ottoman Histories, all of them related to Hungary. Then we describe the intellectual background of L<c3><b6>wenklau's Chronicles. The two parts of the study off er two diff erent answers to the above question. (1) In the 16th century, Hungary fell apart, so it was impossible to conduct deep studies, although they would have served the country's interests. It is thus not surprising that the learned synthesis of sources of Hungarian origin was made by a German Humanist. (2) L<c3><b6>wenklau was a tolerant, gentle, intellectual member of the Bohemian Brethren. His books paint an alternative image of the Turks, one that does not match the commonplaces on the ancient enemy of Christianity, and one that is also distinct from the ""the scourge of God"" destined to revenge crimes according to the Wittenberg Reformation. A desire for universal peace clearly appeared in his works, in addition to the confrontation with the Turks and the idea of the Crusade. The ordinary Hungarian audience was averse to this combination of scholarly research and apocalypticism, so it is not surprising that Hungarian historiography has been largely silent about this great historian of his age.","Ãcs, P",0,,572
778,A Semantics-Based Exploratory Game to Enrich School Classes with Relevant Historical Facts,"The teaching of History in primary and secondary education often attains low levels of learning and understanding. Building on the success of previous experiences in the area of serious games, we are investigating the potential of situational curiosity and serendipity to increase the retention of historical facts. We present a game designed to explore networks of relationships among the topics of upcoming classes (not necessarily History ones) and topics that may be of interest to their students in a given place and/or on a given date. The design of the game's concept is supported by an intelligent system that uses DBpedia and YAGO as the main sources of knowledge in the search for semantic links among concepts. The teachers are given tools to revise the meshes of concepts and relationships, to modify things and to introduce new relationships.","Gustavo Bravo-Quezada, Omar and Lopez-Nores, Martin and Garcia and Nogueiras, Ivan and Perdiz Gradin, Damian and Blanco-Fernandez Yolanda and and Juan Pazos-Arias, Jose and Gil-Solla, Alberto and Ramos-Cabrer, Manuel",0,,573
779,USING FORENSIC PRACTICAL ACTIVITIES TO FOSTER ATTRACTIVENESS TO SCIENCE,"According to the European Commission, around six million young people drop out of school each year - about 14% of the total students' population. Besides the costs and negative consequences to individuals, this phenomenon hinders economic growth and competitiveness. To change this paradigm, it is crucial to improve the attractiveness of STEM-based subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) to young students as an important contribution to generate a high skilled workforce capable of facing new technological changes that are/will challenge Europe. This paper reflects the work that is being performed by the Euro4Science project consortium team during the last four years. Forensic science activities in the classrooms and in the scholar context are used to increase the young students interest in scientific and technical areas, stimulating their motivation and curiosity for science in general and promoting better performance results in STEM-based subjects. A Forensic Science Education Toolbox was developed, tested and implemented in 6 languages (Initially four -EN, PT, PL, BL, and in a second phase two more - GR and TR), containing more than 20 practical laboratory experiments. The Toolbox includes all the materials needed for the implementation of the activities and specific guidance for each one. The teachers and the students have access to manuals with a detailed explanation on how to implement the activities in a safety and funny way. After the development of the initial prototype, the Toolbox and the support materials were adjusted and improved, considering the results of the piloting test phase within schools and feedback from external experts. Afterwards, the refined version of the Toolbox and support materials were disseminated among teachers and schools in several countries through workshops, seminars, training sessions and conferences. Besides detailing the outcomes of the experimentation of the Toolbox, this paper presents the most important communication and dissemination tools of the project to reach the highest possible number of students and teachers involved in the Euro4Science activities in each school - the CSI weeks. These CSI week's will enable students and teachers to use the toolbox activities and understand how the study of forensic science can have a positive impact on the STEM education.","Ribeiro, Ana and Baptista, Amilcar and Costa, Pedro and Moreira Helena and and Souto, Luis",0,,574
780,Infusing Action Mazes into Language Assessment Class Using Quandary,"It is widely acknowledged that problem solving is one of today's prominent skills and is an ongoing activity where learners are actively involved in seeking information, generating new knowledge based on this information, and making decisions accordingly. In this respective, through infusing problem-solving into curriculum of language teaching, it might be possible to help students have responsibility for their own learning and learn a variety of ways to take personal actions to solve problems. In addition, problem-solving enables learners to link new knowledge with the real-life activities, leading to higher levels of thinking. Therefore, the current study aims to encourage learners to utilize problem-solving skills through ""Quandary,"" an application used to create web-based action mazes. The participants include sixty-four prospective teachers of English at the Department of Foreign Language Education at a state university. After the training with hands-on experience on the use of the software, the participants were asked to create a situation related to language assessment and evaluation, together with a number of choices to select. Each resulting situation was required to be presented again with a set of options, leading to a kind of interactive case study where the reader was asked to decide and make decisions based on the presented information. Based on the interviews conducted with the participants, it was determined that the participants improved their problem-solving skills and linked the content of the course with situations. Moreover, the results indicated that quandary has proven to be an interesting means to stimulate the participants' motivation as well as curiosity and interest in the text-based situation.","KiliÃ§kaya, Ferit",0,,575
781,Intrinsic Motivation: An Overlooked Component for Student Success,"Intrinsic motivation to learn involves engaging in learning opportunities because they are seen as enjoyable, interesting, or relevant to meeting one's core psychological needs. As a result, intrinsic motivation is associated with high levels of effort and task performance. Students with greater levels of intrinsic motivation demonstrate strong conceptual learning, improved memory, and high overall achievement in school. Because intrinsic motivation has such a positive impact on school performance, administration of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI), a survey that assesses levels of intrinsic motivation, followed the traditional course in renal physiology taken by second-year medical students. The tool assessed students' interest and enjoyment, perceived competence, perceived choice, and relatedness while performing a specific activity. There is strong support for use of this assessment tool to evaluate an individual's intrinsic motivation in terms of both the validity and reliability, and educators are profoundly interested in how to motivate individuals they educate to mobilize their efforts and persist at tasks inside and outside the classroom. Although students are often moved by external rewards such as grades or evaluations, students are motivated mainly from within by interests and curiosity. These intrinsic motivations can sustain passions, creativity, and efforts toward learning.","Augustyniak, Robert A and Ables, Adrienne Z and Guilford, Philip and Lujan, Heidi L and Cortright, Ronald N and DiCarlo, Stephen E",0,,576
783,ASSESSING LINGUISTIC COMPETENCE THROUGH DIGITAL STORYTELLING IN HIGHER,"According to Recommendation 2006/962/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 on key competences for lifelong learning [Official Journal L 394 of 30.12.2006]*, communication in foreign languages, is one such competence that should be pursued. It involves, ``the ability to understand, express and interpret concepts, thoughts, feelings, facts and opinions in both oral and written form [...] in an appropriate range of societal and cultural contexts [...] according to one's wants or needs. Communication in foreign languages also calls for skills such as mediation and intercultural understanding. An individual's level of proficiency will vary between the four dimensions (listening, speaking, reading and writing) and between the different languages, and according to that individual's social and cultural background, environment, needs and/or interests'' (p. 14). Essential knowledge, skills and attitudes related to this competence include ``knowledge of vocabulary and functional grammar and an awareness of the main types of verbal interaction and registers of language. Knowledge of societal conventions, and the cultural aspect and variability of languages is important. Essential skills for communication in foreign languages consist of the ability to understand spoken messages, to initiate, sustain and conclude conversations and to read, understand and produce texts appropriate to the individual's needs. Individuals should also be able to use aids appropriately, and learn languages also informally as part of lifelong learning. A positive attitude involves the appreciation of cultural diversity, and an interest and curiosity in languages and intercultural communication'' (p. 15). Bearing these recommendations in mind, this paper explores the benefits of implementing a Digital Storytelling project in higher education geared towards aiding learners to acquire the above mentioned key competence. The project involves a clearly defined procedure and is divided into the following stages: completing a pre- and a post-project survey, learning about digital storytelling by completing a WebQuest, making decisions about the digital stories (topic, plot, software and media), sharing stories with classmates through a Learning Management System (LMS), watching fellow classmates' digital stories and posting comments about them in a forum, keeping a log and preparing and presenting their ``making of'' to the whole class, and finally assessing both the digital stories and the oral presentations. The results from a study based on the post project surveys will be presented. The overall results are encouraging as the students report that this approach not only helps them develop linguistic skills but also a number of non-linguistic skills such as digital literacy, collaborative team work, problem-solving and critical-thinking skills.","Gimeno Sanz, Ana and Sevilla Pavon, Ana",0,,577
785,PERSPECTIVE TRANSFORMATION OF INSTRUCTORS IN PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGIES:,"In today's knowledge-based economy, education is not only an essential instrument for knowledge acquisition and self-development, but also a mandatory tool that enables students to secure a good job, gain respect in society, and develop a personal identity. The importance of having the intellectual curiosity, ability to effectively apply the acquired knowledge/skills and job expertise becomes even more crucial in the highly competitive, fast-paced workplace. As a result, students are increasingly pressured to excel and succeed in this compelling academic journey. Globalization and rapid advancements in technology have facilitated many new e-teaching tools and social media platforms to cope with changing trends in students' receptivity to information and communication styles, making it even more essential for educators to continually review the education system in order to convey knowledge to students more creatively and effectively. Consequently, the instructional approaches which influence the behavioral aspect of learning that motivate and stimulate an individual's interest in learning and effective understanding with acquiring of knowledge are essential to examine. With deeper reflection and analysis on the behavioral learning of students, instructors could better comprehend the needs and expectations which facilitate providing their students the necessary inputs. Through this instructional article, a learning framework ``Perspective Transformation of instructors in Pedagogical Strategies'' is proposed to facilitate more effective learning among business students. The conceptual framework proposes a shift from instructor-centric to learner-centric in the instructional roles, design of curriculum and assessments, learning culture and feedback process, by adopting five essential strategies: (1) Performing different instructional roles for varying types of instructional approaches (2) Shift in learning culture: embracing creative learning; (3) Professional soft skills training; (4) Assessments based on three fundamentals of understanding, critical thinking and application; (5) Continuous process of correspondence between instructors and students coupled with reflection in terms of formative and summative feedback; These learning approaches within the proposed framework have been applied in the classroom context at Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Business School, in Semester 2 Annual Year 12/13. They have resulted in good course assessment and examination outcomes with positive feedback from students. This framework continuously allows avenues for further exploration in terms of optimal and effective pedagogical approaches by incorporating practical solutions to calibrate and embrace the rapid changing learning needs and demands.","Rajaram, Kumaran",0,,578
786,Understanding influences on engineering creativity and innovation: A biographical study of 12 outstanding engineering designers and innovators,"Biographical information on 12 outstanding engineering designers and innovators is analyzed to identify the common, likely influences on their remarkable success.Amodel is proposed to explain how these influences interact and develop the knowledge and outcomes necessary for design creativity and innovation: individuals interact with their environment, which provides opportunity, with which they utilize their attitude, interest, and knowledge to act and learn, thereby developing new knowledge and outcomes to attain goals, in the process obtaining internal (from within) and external (from environment) remunerations leading to modification of their interest, attitude, resources, and knowledge for further action and learning. Several common influences are identified: diverse interest and knowledge; hard work; self-belief and drive to solve problems and achieve goals; domain and process knowledge; environment, especially early encouragement; and curiosity- and problem-driven learning. A major implication of the findings is that education into design creativity should support both curiosity- and problem-driven learning of both process knowledge and domain knowledge, for both generation and evaluation of design issues and proposals, ensuring that students get a first-hand taste of the internal remunerations associated with the act of self-driven knowledge creation, while realizing the importance of these various forms of knowledge in complex, creative engineering design and innovation. <c2><a9> 2013 Taylor & Francis.","Chakrabarti, A",0,10.1080/21650349.2013.754643,579

I began flipping through the pages out of sheer curiosity-and was soon astonished by the scale and the depth of their physics coverage. Back then, TIME had a special ""Science"" section in almost every issue and devoted quite a bit of space to the events that would hardly be mentioned in any popular magazine these days. Some of them were fleeting and merely curious, some truly timeless. Many of the articles and notes were devoted to physics: the people, the discoveries, the inventions, the conventions. I found the reading both entertaining and enlightening and would like to offer a sampler here.1 I hope that these little tidbits of history will lighten up the classroom discussions and help inspire your students by reminding them that physics is a dynamic, ever-changing field to which they may well contribute one day. I have found that my own students love it when a little bit of history is brought up; it always generates interesting questions and seems to spark the students' interest in the topic.","Korsunsky, B",0,10.1119/1.4865513,580
788,The Use of Monocarba-<i>closo</i>-dodecaborate Carborane Anion in Catalyst Design,"Carboranes are polyhedral boron-carbon molecular clusters stabilized by electron-delocalized covalent bonding throughout the skeletal framework. Once thought of as novel curiosities due to their structure and bonding, carboranes have now been applied in many diverse fields, from medicine to nanoscale engineering. Of particular interest is the icosahedral monocarba-closo-dodecaborate(-) (HCB11H11 anion) carborane and its derivatives due to their many unique properties. This type of carborane is well known for its extremely low nucleophilicity and considered the most weakly coordinating of all known anions. Also, these carboranes are extremely difficult to oxidize and most are stable to the most aggressive reagents. Because of these unique properties, we explore the use of functionalized carboranes as ligand R-groups in transition metal complexes for their eventual application in catalysis. Organic azides are invaluable building blocks for synthetic chemists. Herein we report the synthesis of various carboranyl azides and some unusual reactivity during the carboranyl azide synthesis. The synthesis and characterization of the parent carboranyl azide (Li+N3CB11H 11-) hexabrominated carboranyl azide (Li+N 3CB11Br6-), the perbrominated carboranyl azide (Li+N3CB11Br11 -), and the perchlorinated carboranyl azide (Li+N 3CB11Cl11-) are reported. We also report unique reactivity involving these new compounds, such as room temperature B-Cl activation of the perchlorinated carba-closo-dodecaborate anion. Though the formation of Schiff bases from amines have long been used in organic chemistry, the condensation of amines to form imines with the carboranyl amine had not yet been reported at the time. Here, we report examples of imine formation with carboranyl amine as well as metal complex formation with carboranyl imines. Also, we report the synthesis of an N-hetereocyclic carbene with the hexabrominated carborane. Phosphine ligands have been used extensively as ligands in metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. Metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are a mainstay of synthetic chemistry. Here, we report the synthesis of various carboranyl phosphine ligands and their use as R-ligands in Pd catalyzed coupling reactions. We also disclose on new and previously unreported activity with carboranyl Pd complexes with different substrates.","Chan, Allen L",0,,581
790,Evaluating the perceived impact of a multicultural counseling course,"The purpose of this study was to better understand how counselors in training develop multicultural competencies through coursework. This study evaluated one graduate level multicultural counseling course. Qualitative methods were employed to uncover students' developmental themes. The five themes that emerged centered on increased multicultural awareness and appreciation. A survey method was employed to determine what facilitated and impeded students' multicultural development. Students' personal traits such as openness, curiosity, and sense of identity facilitated development along with aspects of the classroom environment such as multiculturalism presented as lifelong learning, a feeling of safety and respect in the classroom, and the race of the instructor. Instructional strategies that facilitated multicultural development included writing a personal history paper, watching the Color of Fear, and immersion in diverse communities. Traits of the instructor that contributed to multicultural growth included her level of multicultural knowledge, encouragement of students' self-exploration and self-analysis, and her ability to give corrective and supportive feedback. Students' personal traits that impeded multicultural development were lack of prior exposure to different cultures, lack of prior interest in multiculturalism, lack of ego strength, lack of courage, and an inability to process feelings. Students also felt that the final exam was an impediment to multicultural competency development in this course.

795,Towards capturing and enhancing entertainment in computer games,"This paper introduces quantitative measurements/metrics of qualitative entertainment features within computer game environments and proposes artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for optimizing entertainment in such interactive systems. A human-verified metric of interest (i.e. player entertainment in real-time) for predator/prey games and a neuro-evolution on-line learning (i.e. during play) approach have already been reported in the literature to serve this purpose. In this paper, an alternative quantitative approach to entertainment modeling based on psychological studies in the field of computer games is introduced and a comparative study of the two approaches is presented. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and fuzzy ANNs are used to model player satisfaction (interest) in real-time and investigate quantitatively how the qualitative factors of challenge and curiosity contribute to human entertainment. We demonstrate that appropriate non-extreme levels of challenge and curiosity generate high values of entertainment and we discuss the extensibility of the approach to other genres of digital entertainment and edutainment.","Yannakakis, Georgios N and Hallam, John",0,,584
797,"Student intrinsic motivation, science teaching practices and student learning","This paper has been concerned with the application of basic understandings about intrinsic motivation and curiosity behaviour to the teaching of science, and in particular senior high school biology. The important role of student knowledge in the generation, maintenance and resolution of cognitive conflict is congruent with the renewed interest in studying students' everyday knowledge of curriculum content. However the study of classroom teaching processes in terms of their facilitation of intrinsic motivation is not common. Yet the data collected in this study demonstrates the importance of closely examining the implementation of courses such as the Web of Life, if the arousal of intrinsic motivation is an intended student outcome. Both interview and observational data indicated that the teaching styles adopted by teachers in this study were not likely to engender curiosity amongst students. Perhaps this should be expected. The use of a wide range of reference materials to investigate problems that arise in the classroom, the encouragement of students to do additional work on a topic if they are particularly interested, and a willingness on the part of the teacher to allow students sufficient time to formulate their own solutions to problems are classroom processes which necessitate a greater flexibility in curriculum presentation than can be often tolerated by teacher and school management. Such processes may be incompatible with organisational properties of the school and the pressures often placed upon students to perform to a high standard on rigidly defined examinations. <c2><a9> 1980 Australian Science Research Association.","Fordham, A",0,10.1007/BF02356315,585
798,Digital badge adoption: Earnerâ€™s perceived educational value,"Digital badges are simple tools that have the potential to change the current system of credentialing, creating methods to recognize diverse learning pathways and offer opportunities for both learners and the institutions or entities that offer them. The digital badge movement is still very new, yet is growing as a method to document and communicate what an individual knows or can do. Digital badges highlight skills of the earner, who then displays the badge for someone to view, and can validate anything from mastering a skill to completion of a certain course or documenting the acquirement of a special professional experience. Digital badges have high potential to drive growth for entities that sell education as they have powerful visual potential through the badge itself and that they be displayed across multiple digital sites to large audiences such as LinkedIn. An earner<e2><80><99>s motivation to participate in courses that offer digital badges and display the badge earned can drive growth for entities offering those courses or events. Current formal knowledge and skill achievement programs with recognition for degrees via a paper certificate exists through colleges, universities and some type of job related programs for those outside of school such as a Professional Project Manager certification. The output of these offerings is to get a diploma or certificate which can be displayed in a frame and/or with a line item on a resume recognizing the achievement. So if the earner valued these certificates, they either place the certificate in a frame or display it for all to see; they would add the certification as line item to their resume to share with potential employers; or if applicable, so note them on some other type of shareable medium such as a business card. This is true as well for many companies, businesses or formal certification programs outside of the official education model. Due to the growth of technology, the Internet, social media and portable electronic devices that are with people 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year, people are learning and sharing information about themselves in many different ways. As technology evolves so do the uses. There is a need for recognition of skill and knowledge achievements beyond public, private and higher education. Due to technology advancements, digital badges are a method of recognizing the knowledge and skills a learner currently has or acquires above and beyond formal institutionalized education and outside of a paper-based attendance or certificate completion. Because digital badges are still fairly new, it is important to research the awareness, value, and perceived benefits of digital badges by the earner as they are the ones who will seek to attain and ultimately display them. This will in turn guide the development of programs with digital badges through their areas of interest and create critical mass for those programs offering them. There are three parties engaged in the transaction of a digital badge: earner, this is the person who can earn and choose to display the digital badge; issuer, this the person who has tied all the credentials to the badge and offers it to the earner; and observer, this is the person who looks at the badge displayed or offered digitally by the earner. The purpose of this study is to understand the earner<e2><80><99>s awareness of digital badges, their interest in digital badges and the courses that offer them, and the perceived value of a digital badge and courses that offer digital badges. The current study included one hundred twelve (112) participants completing an initial online survey that gathered characteristics of the learner and ratings on their knowledge awareness, perceived value of digital badges and of courses with digital badges, perceived value of displaying a digital badge and the type of badges they would be interested to earn. A secondary survey was then conducted furthering the initial survey to better understand the value an earner placed on a course with a digital badge and what are the biggest concerns or curiosities of digital badges. The results of the study showed that the earner who is one third of a badge transaction, with the issuer and observer making up the other two-thirds, is interested in digital badges and educational courses that offer them, do see them as valuable to have, display and earn, and do find educational courses that offer them as valuable.","Schwarz, Sandra Jean",0,,586
799,Decision Analysis Techniques for Adult Learners: Application to Leadership,"Most decision analysis techniques are not taught at higher education institutions. Leaders, project managers and procurement agents in industry have strong technical knowledge, and it is crucial for them to apply this knowledge at the right time to make critical decisions. There are uncertainties, problems, and risks involved in business processes. Decisions must be made by responsible parties to address these problems in order to sustain and grow the company business. This study investigates some of the most recognized decision analysis techniques applied by global leaders from 2006 to 2016. Several decision analysis tools are introduced such as heuristic decisions, multi-attribute rating, decision trees, Monte-Carlo simulations and influence diagrams. The theoretical development framework is presented. The approach for this research is Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, and Evaluate (ADDIE), which included cognitive, behavioral, and constructive learning theories. Some of the top decision analysis skills needed for today's leaders and managers from literature review over the past decade (2006 to 2016), were taught to organization leadership doctorate students. Research scheme, the method chosen for selecting the topic, group of contributors, and the method selected for collecting the data are offered. The learners were in their senior year of a leadership doctorate program and they did not need leadership training along with decision analysis technique training. Older learners had more interest in learning the fishbone and influence diagrams prior to the training. Students with intermediate math were more interested in learning about strategic planning techniques before training. The trainees with more computer skills were interested in learning the Zachman framework technique, which was surprising to the researcher since this tool does not require extensive computer skills. After the training, the researcher observed that learners with higher computer skills showed more interest in learning about group decision-making (consensus versus analytic hierarchy process). That students with intermediate math skills were more interested in top-down induction of decision trees, algorithm decision making (data mining and knowledge discovery), and strategic planning techniques. Spearman correlations with a moderate strength showed that older respondents tended to be more interested in the analytical hierarchy process, fishbone diagram, and risk analysis tool. After the training, students with stronger computer skills showed greater curiosity about learning more about the decision tree analysis, Zachman framework, and risk analysis. It made sense that students with weaker computer skills were less eager to learn about the Monte-Carlo simulation.

800,Some problems in dissonance theory research on information selectivity,"journal abstract: Inconsistent results obtained from information selectivity experiments based upon dissonance theory may result from fundamental problems in research designs. The hypotheses tested do not necessarily follow from dissonance theory when the research design uses 2 levels of dissonance. The theory predicts curves of seeking and avoiding with at least quadratic components. In many experiments, the curves are treated instead as positively sloped, linear functions of dissonance. The methods used do not clearly separate seeking from avoiding. Interest in information, used as an index of both seeking and avoiding, is not necessarily an index of avoiding. Ratings, rankings, and time spent looking at information, as they have been used in dissonance research, do not allow separation of seeking and avoiding. A typical research design uses a choice between supporting and opposing information, both to create dissonance and to measure its effects. This technique creates a situation in which both dissonance and dissonance reduction would be expected prior to the choice of information. Selectivity research is concerned with seeking behavior which would also be predicted from curiosity motivation.

801,Beyond Clip Art: Creating Graphics for the Web,"For many librarians and information specialists, the World Wide Web presents a challenge, not only in terms of organizing information, but in creating a visual package that piques the user's curiosity and interest as well as provides orientation to a site. Creating original graphics gives a Web site a unique identity, and forces the designer to think carefully about the layout and hierarchies of the site before creating it. The best way to come up with ideas is to look at other web sites, but it is crucial to consider the future site's audience and the library's resources for building and maintaining the site. This paper provides an introduction and overview for those who do not have formal art or design training but are interested in creating graphics for the Web. Topics include: determining a ""look"" for Web pages; essential software for creating graphics; Web page layout; and designing graphics for various platforms and Web browsers.

802,The implications of â€œminiaturismâ€ for urban tourism destination futures â€“ from micropubs to microbars,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore how the continued interest in the concept of <e2><80><9c>miniaturism<e2><80><9d> has seen the micropub develop into the new format of the microbar and examines the drivers of this trend. It then reflects on the possible implications of the rise of the microbar concept on the future of the urban tourism destination landscape. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper that is built on the natural curiosity of future studies to use an understanding of the present to predict what will happen next and what the implications of those developments will be. Findings: The paper provides a clear definition of the microbar and identifies four distinctive drivers behind its conception, linked to changes in consumer behaviour. These cover the rise of the micro-break, the need for responsible urban regeneration, consumers desire for immediate and unique experiences and increasingly diverse populations. The paper predicts that these trends will drive an increase in microbars leading to greater tourist mobility in the urban tourism destination, more fragmentation and heterogeneity of products and services as well as an intensification in the need for authentic experiences and opportunity driven development giving rise to a hybrid form of guerrilla hospitality. Ultimately the authors predict that the venue will become more important than the specific location when consumers view the landscape of the urban tourism destination. Originality/value: The focus of previous academic research has been on the historic development of the micropub and its impact on regeneration and communities, but very little literature has examined the rise of the microbar and the potential implications for the urban tourism destination. <c2><a9> 2019, Natalie Claire Haynes and David Egan.","Haynes, N C and Egan, D",0,10.1108/JTF-10-2019-0105,590
803,Unsettling antibiosis: how might interdisciplinary researchers generate a feeling for the microbiome and to what effect?,"Decades of active public health messaging about the dangers of pathogenic microbes has led to a Western society dominated by an antibiotic worldview; however recent scientific and social interest in the microbiome suggests an emerging counter-current of more probiotic sentiments. Such stirrings are supported by cultural curiosity around the <e2><80><98>hygiene hypothesis<e2><80><99>, or the idea it is possible to be <e2><80><98>too clean<e2><80><99> and a certain amount of microbial exposure is essential for health. These trends resonate with the ways in which scientists too have adopted a more <e2><80><98>ecological<e2><80><99> perspective on the microbiome. Advances in sequencing technologies and decreasing costs have allowed researchers to more rapidly explore the abundance and diversity of microbial life. This paper seeks to expand on such probiotic tendencies by proposing an interdisciplinary methodology researchers might use to generate more-than-antibiotic relations between lay participants and their domestic microbiome. The paper draws on findings from an ESRC-funded study, Good Germs, Bad Germs: Mapping microbial life in the kitchen (grant number ES/N006968/1), which sought to: (i) explore human-microbe relations in the domestic kitchen; and (ii) make scientific techniques for visualising the domestic microbiome available to non-expert publics through a form of <e2><80><98>participatory metagenomics<e2><80><99>. We examine how scientific knowledge and techniques are enroled into lay practices of making microbes sensible; how these intersect with, reinforce or disrupt previous feelings for microorganisms; and how new ways of relating with microbial others emerge. In reflecting on these findings we draw on work in animal geographies, environmental humanities and the social science of the microbiome. We examine how cultural, emotional and embodied responses to nonhuman others<e2><80><94>their ability to affect <e2><80><98>us<e2><80><99> humans<e2><80><94>have implications for the ways in which public health authorities, researchers and <e2><80><98>lay<e2><80><99> publics alike seek to engage with and govern nonhuman life. We argue that understanding and potentially generating different modes of relating to microbes<e2><80><94>a feeling for the microbiome<e2><80><94>offers opportunities for reconfiguring microbiopolitics and intervening into the ways in which publics respond to perceived microbial opportunities and threats. <c2><a9> 2018, The Author(s).","Greenhough, B and Dwyer, A and Grenyer, R and Hodgetts, T and McLeod, C and Lorimer, J",0,10.1057/s41599-018-0196-3,591
804,SIGNING SCIENCE - INTRODUCING DEAF STUDENTS TO LABORATORY PRACTICE,"Introduction - In Brazil the deaf population is around 9.7 million and only less than 0.02% ever go to university and, of those, an almost derisory minority dedicates themselves to a career in the field of science. Worldwide it has been found that little emphasis is placed on science education for the deaf and this may contribute to the low demand for this area of knowledge. On the other hand, since 2005, the Deaf Project at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and the Federal University of Paraiba, both in Brazil, have attempted to motivate deaf youngsters toward science believing that the data cited above are not related to a lack of interest, but to lack of access to the scientific field. Purpose - To create strategies to attract signing Deaf adolescents toward science. For this, they were invited to participate in a course given in a research lab at the university to make them understand and value laboratory activities. Method - As a first step, an introductory course on safety management and practices in a biological research laboratory was developed, aiming at introducing the students to a research environment and, at the same time, arousing curiosity about scientific research. This was done using a group dynamics approach having as facilitators postgraduate students that normally worked at the laboratory. The course lasted one week and the students were divided into groups that received each a team task. Initially, they should draw in normal size either a man or a woman and their tasks were divided: some should draw what they should not wear in a lab whereas other should draw what they must wear. Then they needed to identify in a real research laboratory the science safety symbols that they could find, such as toxic, corrosive, explosive, inflammable, etc. Then they needed to explain what the symbols meant and what care should be taken. The next step was to explore the necessity to use personal protective equipment such as lab coat, safety spectacles, face shield, gloves, masks, chemical apron, etc. For this, they were given experiments to perform such as working with an (innocuous) microorganism. It was their original decision what kind of protection they should wear but they should explain why, being corrected if they were wrong. Equally, they were given the task to prepare a chemical solution and they should wear protective equipment. They were also introduced to the concept of acid, basic and neutral substances. At the end of the course, they were asked to bring household chemicals and food such as vinegar, shampoo, milk, water, detergent, lemon, apple juice etc. to test the acidity or alkalinity of the substances using red cabbage as an indicator. This was important to approximate chemistry and everyday life. Conclusion - The need to accomplish a specific goal created a sense of belonging that could not be achieved in normal classes. The need to think about the safety precautions that were necessary to be able to perform some experiments led to a clear understanding of the problem they were facing as opposed to just performing a task. Wearing a ``uniform'' (white coat, gloves etc.) made them feel important and increased their self-esteem. An analysis of their opinions after the course indicated that they developed a very positive attitude toward science, the first step into becoming really interested in the subject.","Barral, J and Rodrigues-Mascarenhas, S and Rumjanek, V",0,,592
805,"Stress and emotion: Anxiety, anger, and curiosity","The 17th volume of this prestigious and long-standing Series on Stress and Emotion focuses on recent advances in research by internationally renowned contributors from over a dozen countries. Individual chapters explore the impact of anxiety and stress on emotions in the workplace, school settings, and interpersonal relationships. The original research and practical implications presented in this volume are of interest to all social, behavioral, and medical scientists concerned with stress and anxiety-related issues. The chapters in Part One of this volume examine efforts to assess and manage the effects of stress and anxiety in one's personal life, that result from medical illness, morality issues and athletic competition, along with coping mechanisms across culture and gender. Part Two considers the experience, expression, and control of anger in a variety of cultural, educational and family contexts. The chapters in the final section explore cross-cultural effects of occupational stress and its impact on particular jobs. The contributions to this volume further our understanding of how stress factors, anxious feelings, and emotional responses to both can impact and influence our lives. <c2><a9> 2005 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Spielberger, C D and Sarason, I G",0,10.4324/9780203954577,593
807,"Louis Bourguet, John Toland, and the Republic of Letters","Louis Bourguet (1678-1743) was a Huguenot natural scientist from N<c3><ae>mes who, after studying in Switzerland and Italy, became professor of philosophy and mathematics in Neuch<c3><a2>tel and founded two learned journals. This article, based on his archive in Neuch<c3><a2>tel, looks first at his erudite, scientific, philosophical and religious interests as expressed in his extensive learned correspondence, which also reveals a mixture of curiosity about, and opposition, to irreligious writings, some of which he may, however, have helped to circulate. We then study a document found among his papers, consisting of a commentary written in French in the margins of a manuscript copy of the last two of John Toland's Letters to Serena (1704). Bourguet combines criticism of Toland's view of matter, identified with Spinozism, with a defence of Leibniz's philosophy, presented as the only one capable of demonstrating the need for a god. This manuscript throws new light on interest in Toland's philosophical works in the years following his death, and the posthumous continuation of his debate with Leibniz. More generally, Bourguet's learned interests and networks underline the difficulty of classifying scholars of this period into neat categories and the complex relationship between science, theology and philosophy, and between religious orthodoxies and heterodoxies. <c2><a9> 2017 Erudition and the Republic of Letters.

811,Information Security Culture or Information Safety Culture What do Words Convey?,"In the contemporary world of constantly changing information threats, information security culture is a concept that many organizations should emphasize on. Many threats cannot be countered only with sophisticated technical equipment. Instead, the attitudes and actions of employees gain significance each day, be the threat an urge to leak company confidential documents to Wikileaks or to competitors, or willingness to help a ``colleague'' with an unconventional request. Information security culture is a concept widely accepted in the field of information security research. It refers to the dominant understanding of how information security principles are manifested in the daily operations of a company. The culture implies what kind of behaviour of the employees is acceptable and encouraged. Literature about information security almost non-exceptionally uses the word security. However, in the field of organizational safety culture, the word security has little use. What is different? Is preventing human or material casualties really fundamentally different from preventing information casualties? This paper is triggered by the curiosity of how different literature streams discuss culture, be it called safety culture or security culture. Also the differences in approaches to security and safety are analysed. The term safety includes both the perspective of an object being protected from threats and the perspective of that object not causing threats. The term security includes only the perspective of an object being protected from threats. It is interesting to note, that both the words safety and security appear in the definitions for the term security. In information security the focus is for many organizations on the threats that come from outside the organization. This seems to justify the use of the word security. However, in many cases the biggest threats to the information of an organization come from inside the organization. Also, many organizations state that the information of customers is the most valuable to them and compromising customer information would not only harm the organization itself, but also its stakeholders. This would justify the use of the word safety in connection with information. This paper presents a literature review. The outcome of this paper is an understanding of the differences and similarities of the concepts under stydy. Discussion on the meaning of information security culture and implications to companies are presented.","Ilvonen, Ilona",0,,596
813,Preface,"The idea of this volume emerged during a discussion some years back with Dr. Sahar Huneidi, a Palestinian scholar in exile, who sought to learn about the status of the Palestinian citizens in Israel and their collective experience as both citizens and settler-colonial subjects. Her intellectual curiosity, academic background, and personal interest led to lengthy discussions about the nature of this population's citizenship and how the settler-colonial structure of the Jewish state (or more accurately the Zionist state) is manifested in their collective experience. How is this citizenship in a settler-colonial state exactly reflected in the state's relationship with them? After all, the Palestinian citizens in Israel, who comprise close to one-fifth of the total population of Israel within its pre-June 1967 borders, live under a Zionist system that is built on the premise that the state established on their homeland is actually the <e2><80><9c>state of the Jewish people<e2><80><9d> and the homeland itself is the <e2><80><9c>homeland of the Jewish people<e2><80><9d> <e2><80><93> not theirs. We decided that a volume is needed to focus on the ways that Israel has formulated its relationship with its Arab citizens from the very beginning, even in pre-state days, in such a way that ensures extensive, indisputable, ethnic privileges for Jews across a wide swathe of sociopolitical domains at the expense of Arabs, while simultaneously presenting itself as a democracy. This seemed theoretically important for reasons I present in the first chapter. We also decided that I would edit a volume on this focus, and that Dr. Huneidi would serve as Assistant Editor. Thus, the book was structured with the focus on exploring the nature and the foundational underpinnings of the ethnic privileges granted to Jewish citizens (and noncitizens) in Israel vis-<c3><a0>-vis the Palestinians who are both citizens and natives of the homeland (privileges that apply vis-<c3><a0>-vis other non-Jews in the country). We assembled a group of scholars to examine the roots of these privileges in pre-state Zionist thinking and in the state's political structure; how these privileges are manifested in various spheres; how they are justified by Zionist thought and resisted by Palestinian citizens; and what their long-term implications are. <c2><a9> Cambridge University Press 2017.",,0,10.1017/CBO9781107045316.001,597
814,The index of autonomous functioning: Development of a scale of human autonomy,"A growing interest in the functional importance of dispositional autonomy led to the development and validation of the Index of Autonomous Functioning (IAF) across seven studies. The IAF provides a measure of trait autonomy based on three theoretically derived subscales assessing authorship/self-congruence,interest-taking, and low susceptibility to control. Results showed consistency within and across subscales,and appropriate placement within a nomological network of constructs. Diary studies demonstrated IAF relations with higher well-being, greater daily satisfaction of basic psychological needs, and more autonomous engagement in daily activities. Using an experimental approach, the IAF was shown to predict more positive interactions among dyads. The studies provided a systematic development and validation of a measure of autonomy that is brief and reliable.

815,Exploring political interest as a multidimensional concept,"A politically interested citizenry is vital to a healthy democracy and an informed society. Political interest is highly correlated with important expressions of political engagement, such as voting or taking part in a political discussion, as well as seeking out knowledge about politics. Despite these vital linkages, scholars disagree over what actually constitutes political interest. Scholars have variously defined political interest as one<e2><80><99>s attentiveness to political matters, an intrinsic motivation, a feeling of concern or curiosity, or treat political interest synonymously with political involvement. Unsurprisingly, these disparate definitions have produced a diverse array of operations to measure the concept. This study argues that political interest is a multi-dimensional concept and employs a multi-method approach to investigate those dimensions. The results indicate political interest is an umbrella term with two distinct dimensions: enjoyment and motivation. The thesis concludes by discussing implications for future political science research.","Riddle, George I",0,,599
817,Enhancing visitors' interest in science - A possibility or a paradox?: A study of what scientific content staff members focus on when planning a new exhibition,"Within the enterprise of science and technology centres there exists explicit aims and ambitions to enhance visitors' interest in and knowledge about science. Meanwhile, several researchers question the choice of the scientific content in exhibitions when arguing that a too unproblematic view of science commonly is presented. But how do staff members consider what scientific content to include and how this content can be organised in exhibitions? The results from interviews of staff members, responsible for planning and creating new exhibitions, suggest that they consider the scientific content of their exhibitions to a high extent in terms of organizational matters. This means that the staff members tend to not consider discussions about what aspects of science to include or exclude. Further on, the results imply that the relation between science and society risk being implicit to the visitors, whereas the aspect of scientific processes tend to be overlooked when constructing new exhibitions. The staff members express an anxiety in displaying scientific uncertainties or different models of explanations when arguing that this risks confusing the visitors. However, these aspects of science are, in the field of science education, considered crucial in order to create curiosity and interest in science. Does this mean that science and technology centres, through their eagerness to enhance young visitors' scientific literacy, risk contributing to their detachment from or unconcern for scientific issues? <c2><a9> Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Davidsson, E",0,10.1007/s11165-008-9080-2,600
818,The Ambient Birdhouse: An IoT device to Discover Birds and Engage with Nature,"We introduce the Ambient Birdhouse, a novel IoT design for the home that seeks to encourage awareness and discovery of birds outside. People increasingly have routines and technologies that disconnect them from nature. Moreover birds are hard to come to know, seen but not heard, heard but not seen, or simply around when we are not. The Ambient Birdhouse aims to reconcile these positions, by using local bird media to leverage people's playfulness and curiosity, calmly sustain interest over time and ultimately to garner interest and engagement in nature and conservation projects. We trialled the Ambient Birdhouse with five families. Key findings are that the playful nature of the Birdhouse has an immediate grasp on children, and through them on the rest of the family. Children were prompt to learn bird calls, and invented and played games that involved the Birdhouse. Learning strategies emerged spontaneously from family routines and arrangements, with each family creating different moments and spaces for learning.","Soro, Alessandro and Brereton, Margot and Dema, Tshering and Oliver, Jessica L and Chai, Min Zhen and Ambe, Aloha May Hufana",0,10.1145/3173574.3173971,601

820,Bumps in the Road: Expecting More Than Points on a Chart,"The behaviorist theory encourages educators to use rewards as teaching strategies. Extrinsic rewards eventually reduce intrinsic motivation, cheapen value and love of learning, give the wrong messages, and create an escalating no-win game. Three significant principles of motivation particularly important in fostering internal motivation for independent reading are choice and control, interest/curiosity, and social interaction. Internal motivation becomes the driving force propelling students into the world of reading while the instruction provided by teachers is the admittance ticket into that world. Improving access to appropriate texts and providing reading opportunities enhances ownership of the reading activity by allowing self-selection of texts and fostering conversations about texts before, during, and after reading as a way to stimulate deeper understandings. This article describes two strategies to teach students to become more effective in choosing books for themselves: (1) Goldilocks; and (2) BOOKMATCH which stands for book length (B), ordinary language (O), organization (O), knowledge prior to book (K), manageable text (M), appeal to genre (A), topic appropriateness (T), connection (C), and high interest (H).

Many language teachers might have commonly asked themselves this question. The present study is an empirical investigation of the concept of curiosity in the field of second language acquisition (SLA). Using a mixed-methods design, we aim to conceptualize language learning curiosity (LLC) within the framework of interest/deprivation (I/D) model of curiosity (Litman and Jimerson in J Personal Assess 82(2): 147-157, 2004. https://doi.org/10.1207/s15327752jpa8202_3) and see how it may be recognizably distinct from L2 psychological constructs, as well as how it connects with related constructs such as willingness to communicate, enjoyment, and anxiety. To measure LLC and depict its underlying dimensions, a new curiosity scale was developed and validated in this study. Overall, our results suggest that LLC can be conceived as an affective-cognitive variable reflecting an inquiry-driven interest and desire to learn and use a foreign language.

The events of Sept. 11, 2001, and periodic media focus on RDDs heighten student interest from both a scientific curiosity as well as a personal protection perspective.

Quantitative surveys were administered to 6,089 adults living in 17 communities located in 13 countries; all with active science centers. Data collection and analysis protocols ensured a representative sampling based on age, education, and income from each of the 17 participating communities. Results showed that individuals who used science centers had significantly higher understanding, interest and curiosity, participation in free-choice leisure activities, and identity relative to science and technology than did individuals who did not visit; even when potential self-selection biases such as income, education level, and prior interest were taken into consideration.

He touches on the medical conditions that may lead to stroke and the methods that health care providers use to find out more about the stroke: they rely heavily on a thorough history and physical examination to identify certain stroke symptoms and continue with a variety of tests. This book is thorough and informative, and the illustrations are excellent. Its organization could be improved. This 231-page book is designed to read from front to back rather than to sample as interested. While some readers will be overwhelmed and alarmed by the amount and detail of information, this book can be confidently recommended to an educated layperson who has a basic medical understanding, an intense curiosity, and the desire to become an expert in stroke. Health care providers may also find the book rewarding to keep up with patients and to gather tips on effective communication.

836,"Curiosity: Care, Virtue and Pleasure in Uncovering the New","It is no longer controversial or suspicious to be curious. But, until recently, there has been little curiosity about curiosity itself. This has begun to change, with the publication of a series of books asking what curiosity is and why it matters. Though an eclectic and slippery subject, taking different forms in different times and places, curiosity has two common threads. The first is <e2><80><98>care<e2><80><99>, comprising commitment or interest (committed rather than <e2><80><98>mere<e2><80><99> curiosity) and a quality of attention (carefulness). The second is concerned with <e2><80><98>questions<e2><80><99>, and this highlights the drivers and parameters of enquiry: the mixture of virtue, pleasure and passion that drives explorers (in all their forms) to uncover the new.

838,An analysis of Golgi maturation and inheritance in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>,"In this thesis I analyzed the maturation and inheritance of the Golgi apparatus in budding yeast. The idea that the Golgi matures has been around for over forty years. In this view the Golgi is a dynamic organelle in which cisternae are constantly turning over. On the other side of the debate is the stable compartments model, in which the individual cisternae are stable structures whose biochemical composition remains unchanged. To distinguish between these models, my colleagues and I directly observed the Golgi in living cells. Our work showed for the first time that the Golgi does indeed mature. We followed individual Golgi cisternae over time and observed the change from early to late identity. Furthermore, I compared the cisternal lifetime with the transit time of secretory cargo through the Golgi. The two sets of measurements matched, suggesting that secretory cargo transits the Golgi in maturing cisternae. These findings open the way for molecular and mechanistic analyses of cisternal maturation. My interest in Cdc1p grew out of curiosity about Golgi inheritance. A previous student showed that cdc1 mutants have defects in late Golgi inheritance, and I reasoned that by figuring out the function of Cdc1p, I could gain insights into the mechanism of Golgi inheritance. The results presented in this thesis allowed me to formulate a model for the function of Cdc1p and its effect on Golgi inheritance. I propose that Cdc1p is a manganese-dependent ER-localized lipid phosphatase, with an active site facing the lumen. In cdc1 mutants, defective phosphatase activity leads to accumulation of a metabolite, probably a phosphorylated lipid, that activates calcium signaling. This signaling causes actin depolarization and a late Golgi inheritance defect. My findings pave the way for future experiments that will focus on identifying the substrate of Cdc1p and elucidating how calcium signaling affects Golgi inheritance.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

It is acknowledged that the good quality of practical work promotes the engagement and interest and curiosity of students as well as developing a range of skills, science knowledge, and conceptual understanding. Specifically, this study examined the contribution of activities and materials developed for teaching science to students with VI which are found difficult to comprehend even by the sighted students. The research was carried out in three steps. In the first step, the exploratory case study was used in order to identify the needs of the students. In the second step, instructional materials and activities were designed to meet the needs of students. In the last step, the evaluative case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the designed activities and activity materials. In conclusion as students with VI are easily distracted by unnecessary details, it is equally essential to design materials and activities to be as simple as possible, as well as focusing on only few core ideas in each practical work, rather than covering several ideas through a single activity.","Kizilaslan, Ayd<c4><b1>n and Zorluoglu, S Levent and Sozbilir, Mustafa",0,10.1080/08856257.2020.1732110,617

843,"Vladimir Iowa Lenin, Part 1: A Bolshevik Studies American Agriculture","A busy year for Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, 1917 also marked the publication of his study of American agriculture. The report reads as more than a historical curiosity, offering insights, however era-bounded, on a variety of topics of substantive and epistemological interest today. Lenin writes of the history of American agriculture, its dynamic regionalism, and its sector-specific class conflicts. Along the way, despite his obvious structural tendencies, we meet an anti-foundational author who, while upbraiding bourgeois economists for their expedient technicism, often in scathing terms, also warns that sweeping conclusions about the sizes of farm and capitalization are problematic in the face of historically dependent and contradictory trends. Here, in the first of the paper<e2><80><99>s two parts, we begin to place Lenin<e2><80><99>s project in the broader stream of critical agrarian studies, including the classic contrast with agricultural economist Alexander Chayanov, but also the diseconomies of modern agriculture, the biological limits on industrializing food production, and Stalin<e2><80><99>s <e2><80><9c>dekulakization<e2><80><9d> campaign.

845,The Landscape Attractiveness of Abandoned Quarries,"This study is a trial for presenting high attractiveness of shape form in abandoned quarry areas, as well as for indicating social interest in the areas in terms of their attractiveness. For this reason, a procedure of evaluation of the landscape attractiveness of abandoned quarries is suggested, which was created by assigning additional partial criteria, and their comparison with the criteria of already existing methods. Methods used for the research are as follows: the semantic differential technique (also called Osgood<e2><80><99>s method), the entropy method, and the method of point bonitation. In order to verify the procedure suggested, 10 objects (quarries) located in the area of the <c5><9a>l<c4><99><c5><bc>a Landscape Park with its buffer zone were studied. Then, comparative studies were conducted, this time with quarries from Great Britain and Austria, also subject to some forms of environmental protection. The results of the research suggest that the main indicator of a quarries<e2><80><99> attractiveness is their uniqueness, aesthetic appeal, interest, and the curiosity they raise, which allows the formation of four classification groups for attractiveness: very attractive, attractive, slightly attractive, and unattractive quarries. The research conducted also indicates that highly attractive quarries may gain a larger number of tourists and the development of hiking, cycling, horse riding, and, in some cases, also qualified tourism (rock climbing or diving) through creating additional side attractions. Additionally, due to their uniqueness and form differentiation, abandoned quarries may be used for common social education, being a didactic place in programmes of touristic trips, science lessons, and ecological education. <c2><a9> 2017, The Author(s).","Baczy<c5><84>ska, E and Lorenc, M W and Ka<c5><ba>mierczak, U",0,10.1007/s12371-017-0231-6,620
846,Principles of comparative psychology,"This book, initiated by Willard Caldwell, represents the combined efforts of a group of psychologists working in the field of animal study to present the data and the interpretations of those data in this fascinating area. The contributors were selected because they are themselves responsible for much of the research material brought together in the text. Each is an independent scholar in his own area and is thus best able to interpret the outcomes of experimental and theoretical studies in that area. The authors have tried to incorporate recent findings without neglecting the standard, time-tested material to be expected in a book that proposes to survey the entire field. The following features of the text illustrate this effort: a new look at the old problem of innate behavior; the effects of early experience on the development of sensory and perceptual abilities; the added insight on neural mechanisms resulting from the application of recently developed techniques; new research trends in motivation; fresh evaluations of findings in the areas of social and abnormal behavior; the role of genetics in the analysis of behavior; an account of the contributions of European ethologists to comparative psychology; the study of many different species; and the inclusion of divergent theoretical points of view rather than the particular biases of the contributors and editors. The book is designed to be more than a mere compilation of factual materials. Experimental findings are essential, but of equal, or greater, interest are the principles drawn from these findings. The references listed at the end of each chapter will direct the interested student to the original sources for a more detailed statement of the techniques and data on which the textual material is founded.

The science learning given in this way is one of the appropriate alternatives in introducing the concept of science to children because basically science learning can improve cognitive, affective, and psychomotor development, and foster thinking ability of children. The introduction of the concept of science to early class children cannot be separated from the role of the teachers as educators, because teacher has the important role. The science material presented is chosen in such a way that it can be presented more attractively. The learning process is done through interesting activities, arousing curiosity, motivating children to think critically and discovering new things, therefore the instructional media is presented with an interesting and creative activity that is using the magic game technique on the basis of that it is needed to do in-depth study of science instructional media in the form of a magic game on the concept of solid effect in the early classroom school.","Arifin, Irvin Novita",0,,623
849,Personal informatics for everyday life: How users without prior self-tracking experience engage with personal data,"The spreading of devices and applications allowing people to collect personal information opens new opportunities for Personal Informatics. Although many of these tools are already effectively used by motivated people to gain self-knowledge and produce change in their behaviors, there is a great number of users that are potentially interested in Personal Informatics but do not know of its potentialities and criticalities. In order to investigate how users perceive and use self-tracking tools in everyday life, we conducted a diary study, requiring fourteen participants with no previous experience in Personal Informatics to use a variety of trackers. We discovered that they use and perceive these technologies differently from the ones experienced in self-tracking. Participants considered the act of collecting personal information burdensome, with no beneficial reward. We also uncovered a series of problems that they experienced while tracking, managing, visualizing, and using their data. Among them we found that the lack of suggestions on using data and the excess of abstract visualization in the apps prevented users to gain useful insights. As a result, their interest in self-tracking soon faded, despite their initial curiosity in exploring and ``playing'' with their data. Starting from the findings of this study, we identified seven design strategies to better Personal Informatics tools, supported by literature and examples that draw from different research fields, from tangible interfaces, to virtual environments and video games. These strategies are primarily addressed to satisfy the inexperienced users' needs, but their applicability can be reasonably extended to all the individuals curious and interested in Personal Informatics.

Dr. Shore's book is on a subject of very great present interest to us, but it does not contain much of what we most want to know. We can pretty well take for granted that education among the Russians is being used to advance and perfect the Communist state, that it is realistically emphasizing polytechnical training, that it is designed to cultivate intense hatred of whatever and whomever the Party leaders call bourgeois. Shore likes especially to dwell on these and closely related matters. He fails to satisfy our curiosity about the marked shifts in Soviet educational policies in the last dozen years. All in all the book is not very well organized and it is not easy to get from it the good it does have to offer. It deals best with things that probably at this time matter least. It does not make clear the exact nature of the challenges presented to us in education by our great and distrusting world neighbor.

853,Writing Code to Assess Geometric Reasoning,"Eliciting student thinking is paramount to effective mathematics teaching and learning. Although one can use many strategies and techniques to promote student thinking, technology is one resource that is often underutilized. Whether it is the informed use of calculators or an interactive website, technology can be leveraged to promote mathematical curiosity, reasoning, and communication. As discussed in NCTM's ""Principles to Actions: Ensuring Mathematical Success for All,"" when electronic tools are used meaningfully, ""students have a greater sense of ownership of the mathematics that they are learning, since the applications promote a sense of shared enterprise in the learning of mathematics."" Indeed, in a meta-study of technology and student engagement, Moos and Marroquin (2010) found that student interest is enhanced when learners are free to use technology in student-centered environments. With these benefits in mind, this article explores how fifth-grade students' use of technology, specifically writing code using the platform ""Scratch,"" not only promoted curiosity and mathematical reasoning but also allowed for a more detailed way of assessing students' prior geometric understanding. Examples of student work appear along with suggestions of how anyone can learn to code with ""Scratch.""","Bolognese, Chris A",0,,627

855,Examining quantum oddities within the context of other major scientific theories,"Analogies are often used in introductory quantum lectures to help students deal with the abstract aspects of this difficult subject. This article discusses a strategy to introduce the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics within the context of three other major scientific theories: evolution, gravity, and special relativity. The use and scope of these conceptual analogies can be tailored to the particular background of the audience at hand. While not all instructors will deem this technique suitable to their general chemistry students, many others will find valuable discussion material. In the author's experience, a 20 minutes discussion on these sensorial oddities can trigger the students' interest for quantum mechanics and capture their attention in subsequent lectures. On the whole, the fundamental lesson conveyed by the analogies is: We humans, under normal circumstances, cannot personally experience the empirical effects of any of these four theories because they occur beyond the range of our sensorial capabilities. We need very long time intervals to observe noticeable evolutionary changes, very large masses to create our own gravitational attraction, traveling speeds close to c to detect significant time dilations, and atom-like sizes to undergo quantum effects. The discussion of these sensorial limitations offers students a broader conceptual framework to understand the odd behavior of quantum systems. Instructors can use this strategy to stimulate intellectual curiosity and introduce the main fundamental concepts of quantum theory with just a bit of algebra and quantitative reasoning. If time allows, simple quantitative exercises can be assigned to students to show that we could better perceive the effects of these theories if the constants or units involved in the pertinent equations (<ce><94>t, G, c, and h) are made smaller or bigger. <c2><a9> Division of Chemical Education.","Molina, P A",0,,629
857,Disciplining knowledge: Representing resources for southeast Asian studies in the libraries of the U.S. academy,"In response to an invitation to write a provocative discussion paper on the question of international collaborative preservation of cultural heritages of Southeast Asia, Jennifer Lindsay, formerly program officer for the Ford Foundation in Jakarta, wrote a short story. The story, entitled ""The Keepers,"" written for a conference at Chiang Mai University in 2000, describes the clash of interests and understandings that occurred when an American graduate student conducting his anthropological research in Yogyakarta ""discovered"" a private collection of valuable manuscripts relating to his subject.1 The custodian of the documents, an elderly dance practitioner, was honored to share the collection and his ritual knowledge with the young man, even approving a U.S. foundation-funded project to preserve the manuscripts on microfilm. As the story develops, Lindsay's caricatures-based on characters very well known to anyone in the Southeast Asian librarian community-trace the misunderstandings that emerge when the manuscripts are filmed, duplicated, and cataloged and surrogates are deposited at the Center for Research Libraries in Chicago. Lindsay's story explores the sensitivities at stake as the guardian's role, and his understandings of his responsibilities toward the preservation of his cultural knowledge, are gradually challenged and pitted against the modernizing techniques of the Euro-American library and archiving profession. Lindsay's story complicates this rational narrative of technological progress by emphasizing the personal and institutional ambitions of the scholars, project managers, funding agencies, and national governments involved in the project and calls into question the competence of the normative organizing structure of the modernizing intervention. Finally, her story highlights the personal and community loss, as the texts became objectified in a high-profile international project that preserved the collection in modern scientific ways and integrated it into an international scholarly corpus. The traditional curator's original trust in his personal relationship with the researcher was rewarded by the unwanted attentions of centralgovernment bureaucracies, which were urged by this international attention to intervene in local questions of cultural heritage. Governmental efforts to remove the collection to ""safekeeping"" in national repositories resulted in the severing of the ties between the artifacts and their ritual communities. This story underscores the difficulty of balancing local agency with pressures for a global access to knowledge and a perceived shared responsibility toward preserving and documenting the world's textual heritage according to norms of archiving practice. In this process of preserving its textual expression, the heritage itself is transformed from local ritual knowledge to international ""research archive."" The story also provides a subtext for much of the discussion contained in this essay, in which I illustrate the tensions between the normative empirical structures dominating Euro-American conceptions of knowledge organization and the emerging awareness of the need to ""represent"" local knowledge from Southeast Asia on its own epistemological terms. This binary seems to exist in a dialectical relationship within another register of representational interventions, which posit cultural knowledge in a continuum between what I will call bibliographic and exhibitionary orders. The bibliographic order is that knowledge system prevailing within libraries which privileges the published word as a transparent vehicle of authoritative and rational scientific modernity and named authorial responsibility but which does not indiscriminately include non-Western texts in its purview.2 Indeed, such notions of acknowledged authorial responsibility and claims to origination, as opposed to serial orality and textual redaction, have been quite recent products of the imposition of colonial economic and legal practices within the region. In this dialectic of representational tropes, I invoke Timothy Mitchell's notion of the ""exhibitionary order,"" which has influenced recent conceptions of presenting material culture for display. Within this order, native artifacts are aestheticized and commodified as exotic objects of the white man's gaze.3 In the colonial context that Mitchell exposes, the exposition is unmasked as an attempt to make legible the disorder of the other, and to do so in ways that reaffirm and naturalize the homogenized order of the white subject. Reality becomes only that which can be represented, in a system of signification in which objects are displayed before observing subjects as ""mere 'signifiers' of something further.""4 In the context of the library world, where the book as reproducible creative artifact is characterized not only by its endogenous content but also by its ability to signify ""something further,"" it is useful to compare Mitchell's idea of the exhibitionary order with Walter Benjamin's concept of ""exhibitionary value."" This latter characteristic of the creative product is that which, under the influence of the technologies of mechanical reproduction, lends itself to the reproducibility of the modern information age. Benjamin imagines a process through which the unique artistic product moves from its traditional cult value as the object of fetish to an ""exhibitionary value"" that satisfies an emerging modern need for spatial proximity to the artifact or its reproducible surrogate.5 In the bibliographic world it is the slippage from Benjamin's exhibitionary value of the reproduced artifact within its natural ritual community to an exhibitionary order in which the artifact becomes fetishized by its commodity and art value within the unnatural display of the library collection that interests me. Failing to place textual artifacts satisfactorily within a normative bibliographic order, libraries are in danger of the strategic placement of local knowledge as an object of curiosity and wonder, its textual artifacts mere markers of an exotic visual and linguistic universe illegible to the average library user. These non-Western texts, already marked by the otherness of their language, may not be treated as carriers of knowledge equal to that of the modern ""Western"" text but as artifacts carrying a range of significations of a different register, from icons of a ""traditional"" cult value to markers against which a trajectory of modernity's ubiquitous reproducibility and spatial proximity may be measured. Indeed, as Daniel Lev has pointed out, even into the late 1960s, it was argued that only certain languages counted as scientific under criteria for fulfillment of graduate school requirements: These languages were German, French, Russian, Spanish, Italian, and possibly Japanese. Other languages were defined as little more than ""tools"" that gave access to local views,6 just as vernacular texts are viewed as unmediated ""primary resources"" reflecting local realities, and as self-reflective scholarly contributions of ""scientific"" discovery only to the extent that they can be judged against Euro-American norms of scholarly fashion. Library treatments of such texts may be pragmatically inevitable, as they attempt to translate knowledge worlds into systems that have meaning in our own local contexts, but they are nonetheless both exoticizing and minimizing.7 While Euro-American disciplinary practice has focused on emphasizing the ritual, sacral, and performative origins of local cultural production-and these genealogies are inherently represented in library knowledge systems by such essentializing qualifying terminologies as ""ethnology"" and ""mythology""8-Western texts are not accorded qualifying description based on these categorical judgments, even though their ideological foundations in esoteric or mythical knowledge systems might well be worthy of such qualifications. The categorizations of bibliographic ""description"" place local knowledge categorically and often inappropriately within a rational Euro-American nomenclature, much of it dating from orientalism's constructions of the colonial world, enabled by the theoretical propositions of anthropology.9 With its post-World War II expansion on U.S campuses as an area of study, Southeast Asia became a focus of systematic library collecting.

858,XTribe: a web-based social computation platform,"In the last few years the Web has progressively acquired the status of an infrastructure for social computation that allows researchers to coordinate the cognitive abilities of human agents in on-line communities so to steer the collective user activity towards predefined goals. This general trend is also triggering the adoption of web-games as a very interesting laboratory to run experiments in the social sciences and whenever the contribution of human beings is crucially required for research purposes. Nowadays, while the number of on-line users has been steadily growing, there is still a need of systematization in the approach to the web as a laboratory. In this paper we present Experimental Tribe (XTribe in short), a novel general purpose web-based platform for web-gaming and social computation. Ready to use and already operational, XTribe aims at drastically reducing the effort required to develop and run web experiments. XTribe has been designed to speed up the implementation of those general aspects of web experiments that are independent of the specific experiment content. For example, XTribe takes care of user management by handling their registration and profiles and in case of multi-player games, it provides the necessary user grouping functionalities. XTribe also provides communication facilities to easily achieve both bidirectional and asynchronous communication. From a practical point of view, researchers are left with the only task of designing and implementing the game interface and logic of their experiment, on which they maintain full control. Moreover, XTribe acts as a repository of different scientific experiments, thus realizing a sort of showcase that stimulates users' curiosity, enhances their participation, and helps researchers in recruiting volunteers.","Caminiti, Saverio and Cicali, Claudio and Gravino, Pietro and Loreto, Vittorio and Servedio, Vito D P and Sirbu, Alina and Tria, Francesca",0,10.1109/CGC.2013.69,631

The Gestalt Process Approach to teaching reading encourages the active involvement of the learner, including whole word recognition, word boundary, multi-language activities, instant sight word development and sentence building. Based on this process, two first grade teachers daily used word card study for each child in their classes, regardless of level. Instruction followed a pattern of presentation which included concrete (naming objects), semi-concrete (matching objects to words), semi-abstract (matching words to pictures), and abstract (word cards held up when called). Then, when handed a reader, students could read it. Two other classes followed the basal linear curriculum. Findings indicated support for the Gestalt Process Approach.

861,Psyche's virtual reality: A psychological exploration of self-doubt in the experience and structure of the post-modern self,"Self-doubt is a crisis in being. Based on the professed experiences and implied psychological structure of an introverted intuitive woman's voice in an amalgamated phenomenological recitation, this work explores an experience of self-doubt, and finds it to be a crisis in which the self is alienated from her own sense of self, from her relations with others, from a sense of connection with her culture, and from her identity as one of the human family. It is a crisis in which there is a fluctuation and a conflict in thought and feeling which gives rise to a disorientation about what is real, what is possible, what is good. ""Something about who I am is self-doubt,"" writes the woman, ""it is like 'doubt' is the state, that it precedes the 'self' part."" She frequently is stuck in a frightened, paranoid-schizoid place, caught in a cycle fueled by her longing and patterns of remembering, which moves from the strong energy of desire, expectation, interest, and curiosity, through an automatic containment with questioning and ambivalence, into a reactive, associative, negativity of affect and thought, igniting harsh self-attack in which she stands outside herself and objectifies her actions, and thoughts, and feelings, which then excites strong energy again. She loses track of her subjectivity. In this cycle she is distanced from the part of herself which knows a more open and symbolic functioning, and cannot reliably access the depressive capacity for play. Possibility, life, narrows. This study synthesizes certain depth psychological approaches concerning the process of development of a sense of self, focusing on the disruption of this development in the existential tension of self-doubt, both in trapsychically and in the interrelational, cultural, and mythic contexts of the postmodern Western world. To date, very little has been directed in the literature to either the specific experience or the theoretical understanding of the ubiquitous and crippling phenomenon of self-doubt. With the text of this study I begin to form new theoretical connections among the various depth understandings in this area, work to open up and integrate insights within analytical psychology, psychoanalytic psychology, archetypal psychology, ego psychology, object relations, self and intersubjective psychologies, attachment and developmental theories of self, and parallel the individual subjective experience with its cultural-historical mirror in the modern Western world using theoretical writing, and mythological and poetic images. As such, this work is largely a theoretical dissertation using a hermeneutic and heuristic method, organized around a thematic and synthetic exploration of a psychological process and reality, which is established by a description through a created phenomenological monologue. In this process, the work elaborates a particular experience of self-doubt, identifies some structural and typological realities in this experience, isolates the experience of self-doubt in terms of a struggle with psychological separation and dependence, and in terms of its patterns of affect and cognition, and touches on its expression in the multiple realms of sense of self, making a beginning into understanding a significant psychological reality.

862,College Teachers Who Stimulate Curiosity,"Characteristics of 30 University of Illinois college teachers judged to be best at stimulating student curiosity and their teaching practices were studied in 1978, based on interviews and results of student evaluations of teacher performance. Attention was directed to undergraduate and graduate training, teaching experience during graduate study, teaching experience since receiving the doctorate, courses regularly taught, grading practice and kinds of exams employed, and the teacher's self-perceptions regarding their grading practices. The teachers also described their classroom activities and instructional materials. The special strengths of the teaching methods employed by the respondents were as follows: the use of vivid illustrative examples, hands-on experiences (labs, field trips, and clinical case studies), and brain teasing problems, with emphasis upon questioning and interactive lecturing. The mean number of years of teaching experience was 13 with a range from 3 to 30 years, and nearly all of the teachers taught both undergraduate and graduate courses. The commonly stated characteristics ascribed to the teachers by students to open-ended questions on course evaluation questionnaires were enthusiasm, ability to stimulate thinking, willingness to listen, humor, questioning techniques, and ""best instructor."" The single feature of the interviews that appeared clearly important was the teachers' encouragement of students' questions and their use of rhetorical questions in their lectures. The professors seemed to be interested in their students not just as students but as persons. Their teaching methods emphasized problematic content that stimulated curiosity, thought, and interest. Examples of teaching exercises are included. (SW)","Jones, R Stewart",0,,634
863,"Educational Media and Technology Yearbook, Volume 42","This is Volume 42 of the ""Educational Media and Technology Yearbook."" For the past 40 years, the Yearbook has contributed to the field of Educational Technology in presenting contemporary topics, ideas, and developments regarding diverse technology tools for educational purposes. This Yearbook has inspired researchers, practitioners, and teachers to consider how to develop technological designs and develop curricula and instruction integrating technology to enhance student learning, teach diverse populations across levels with effective technology integration, and apply technology in interactive ways to motivate students to engage in course content. Part One of this updated volume, ""Trends and Issues in Learning, Design, and Technology,"" presents: (1) Issues and Trends in Instructional Technology: Access to Mobile Technologies, Digital Content, and Online Learning Opportunities Continues as Spending on IT Remains Steady (Abbie Brown and Tim Green); (2) Second Thoughts: Understanding the Impact and Appropriate Use and Non-use of Technologies (Brad Hokanson and Amie Norden); (3) Enhancing Student Critical Literacy through Social Annotations (Yu-Tien Huang, Shu-Min Shih, and Sheng Shiang Tseng); and (4) 2019 Scholarship Rankings (Rick West and Robert Bodily). In addition, Volume 42 features the Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) research and educational use cases, organized and coordinated by Vivienne and David. This section provides evidence that the affordances of AR, VR, and mixed reality, defined as an immersive multi-platform experience reality (XR), have begun to make indelible changes in teaching and learning in the United States. XR's recent developments stimulated the editors to propose a special edition to mark the interoperability of immersive technology to push the boundaries of human curiosity, creativity, and problem solving. After years of incremental development, XR has reached a critical level of investment, infrastructure, and emerging production. The chapters included in Part Two illustrate how XR can push user inquiry, engagement, learning, and interactivity to new levels within physical and digital contexts.

865,"The Golden Helix: Origins, ethnicity and preconception genetic screening in Israel","The unique Israeli nation-wide programme of voluntary, free-of-charge programme of ""population genetic screening for reproductive purposes"" screens for ""frequent and severe"" genetic diseases. It is grounded in the observation that specific groups in Israeli population carry ""founder mutations"": changes in DNA appearing with a high frequency in a given population. The Israeli enthusiasm for genetic testing and screening was linked with the Zionist ideology, traditional Jewish valorization of the family, a shared understanding of difficulties of life in Israel, fear of disastrous consequences of a pregnancy and, for some, also a lingering influence of eugenic ideas. This article proposes a somewhat different view. It argues that the development of state-sponsored genetic screening in Israel was to an important extent a result of a partly contingent encounter between a national ideology, a traditional Jewish respect for science - or for some the absence of a critical view of science - the development of new biomedical technologies, and the multilevel professional interests of physicians and geneticists: from curiosity and a wish to help mutation carriers - Jewish and non-Jewish - to have healthy children, to financial interests in the development of genetic testing and a widespread apprehension of juridical pursuits. <c2><a9> 2017 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Zielinska, A C and L<c3><b6>wy, I",0,10.1057/s41292-017-0070-3,636
866,Dangerously Addictive. Why we are biologically ill-suited to the riches of modern America?,"For the past quarter century we have worshiped the ""free"" market as an ideology rather than a natural product of human social evolution. Under the spell of this ideology and the false promise of instant riches, the America's immigrant values of thrift, prudence and community concern - traditionally the foundation of the American Dream - have been hijacked by an all-consuming self-interest. That the human animal is a curiosity-driven pleasure seeker easily seduced is of no surprise to the behavioral neuroscientist. ""Overloading"" the brain's ancient reward circuits with excessive stimulation - through drugs, novel experience, or unlimited choice - will trigger craving and insatiable desire. When desire is lost we call it anhedonia -or depression -and consider it an illness. But when the brain's reward circuits are overloaded or unconstrained, then desire can turn to craving and to an addictive greed that co-opts executive analysis and commonsense. Adam Smith - the eighteenth century Scottish philosopher and capitalism's patron saint - believed that ""self-love"" (instinctual self-interest) within the give and take of a market framework would create a self-regulating economic order. Today the tethers that gave us Adam Smith's enduring metaphor of an ""invisible hand"" balancing market behavior, have been weakened by an intrusive mercantilism that never sleeps. Before 1985 American consumers saved on average about 9% of their disposable income but by 2005 the comparable savings rate was zero as mortgage, credit card and other consumer debt rose to 127% of disposable income. America had transformed itself from the world's bank to a debtor nation. With the nation's financial system at the brink of disaster we found ourselves rudely awake. Now with reality challenging the laissez faire ideology of recent decades we have the opportunity to take stock with a renewed self-awareness, to curb our addictive striving and to reach beyond immediate reward to craft a vigorous, equitable and sustainable market society - one where technology and profit serve as instruments in achieving the good life and are not confused with the good life itself.","Whybrow, P C",0,,637

872,Aspects of sexual discrimination by female Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens Regan),"Recorded responses of female Betta splendens to various stimuli (e.g., live male and female B. splendens) presented behind a transparent partition. The models consisted of 4 pairs, one member of which had long male-like fins and raised opercula, and the other, short femalelike fins and lowered opercula. The 1st pair had lifelike coloring; the other 3 pairs had ""aggressive,"" ""submissive,"" and ""reproductive"" colorings. The responses to live males and females differed primarily in the amounts of agonistic behavior shown to each, and in the color patterns adopted. Four main motivational systems are suggested as influencing a female's response to a conspecific: (a) a close display response elicited by a female conspecific, (b) a mate-or-flee response to a male conspecific (affecting primarily the color pattern adopted by the female), (c) an overt-aggression response most often elicited by a female conspecific, and (d) a ""curiosity"" response indicating interest in a stimulus. Females appear to distinguish 3 classes of conspecific: ""displaying female,"" ""courting male,"" and ""other."" There was some indication that females discriminate the sex of conspecifics using only fin length and body pattern cues, but unlike the males, it appears likely that these cues are not the primary ones.

875,Using historical fiction to help students gain a deeper understanding of key social issues,"Over the years, various educators have asserted that historical fiction is capable of developing interest, curiosity, and imagination in students, and they have argued that a textbook fact driven approach is more likely to stifle those very things. Put another way, historical fiction can ""bring history to life"". Freeman and Levstik also assert that using historical fiction can ""recreate a sense of time and place that often eludes elementary children as they study the past"". At the same time, it can help students make connections between the past and the present. It can also serve as a launching point for students to posit questions about various aspects of history, which, in turn, can lead to a deeper understanding of historical events. Moreover, critically embracing fiction in a resource-rich social studies class can even help students see history as something to tinker with and do, not just to admire from afar. All of these positive effects, though, are not free of consequence. While many tout the benefits of historical fiction, its use in the social studies classroom is also connected to long-running critiques of textbook-driven teaching. It is important to note that historical fiction is not simply advocated as a replacement for a textbook, with similar testing and evaluating tools as the primary measure of student learning; rather, the stories in historical fictional are perceived as a springboard for deeper work. Students need to be encouraged and guided to make use of such critical reading and thinking skills as sharing and comparing texts, evaluating texts, and reimagining them in order to get at the heart of history. By incorporating such learning activities in the classroom, teachers can support students in asking questions about what they are reading and in problematizing and considering multiple perspectives.

877,Prospective teachers' general epistemic curiosity and domain-specific epistemic curiosity: The mediating role of perceived instrumentality,"Despite the fact that both epistemic curiosity and perceived instrumentality are two important concepts necessary to understand student motivation in educational settings, they have not been examined together in a single study in teacher education to date. Thus, based on the survey method with simple random sampling, this study examined the mediating role of prospective teachers' perceived instrumentality regarding pedagogical and domain knowledge categories in the relationship between their general epistemic curiosity and domain-specific epistemic curiosity regarding these knowledge categories. A total of 413 prospective teachers, majoring in mathematics teaching, primary school teaching, art teaching, special education teaching, and social studies teaching at a large university located in the North-West of the Black Sea region in Turkey, voluntarily participated in the study. The sample consisted of first-year, second-year, third-year, and final-year prospective teachers. Using correlation, regression, and structural equation modeling analyses, the data were analyzed inductively in order to obtain valid and reliable results. The results of the present study showed that the prospective teachers' interest-type general epistemic curiosity and deprivation-type general epistemic curiosity significantly and strongly predicted their interest-type epistemic curiosity regarding domain knowledge and deprivation-type epistemic curiosity regarding pedagogical knowledge categories, respectively. The results also showed that the relationship between the prospective teachers' interest-type general epistemic curiosity and interest-type epistemic curiosity regarding domain knowledge is partly, but significantly, mediated by their perceived instrumentality regarding domain knowledge; whereas the relationship between the prospective teachers' deprivation-type general epistemic curiosity and deprivation-type epistemic curiosity regarding pedagogical knowledge is partly, but significantly, mediated by their perceived instrumentality regarding pedagogical knowledge. These results suggest that the prospective teachers' epistemic curiosity should be considered together with perceived instrumentality in order to see the picture of their interests in pedagogical and domain knowledge categories more comprehensively. Implications for teacher education and directions for future studies are also discussed in the present study. <c2><a9> 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.","Eren, A",0,,642

Upon reflection of these successes, Chapter Five responds to the question, <e2><80><9c>How can creativity be promoted in educational online courses to prepare all students, including the gifted, to successfully compete in a future marketplace?"" A heightened awareness of the competitive nature of international expectations on today<e2><80><99>s students places a greater importance on educators to meet the present and future needs that will prepare students for tomorrow<e2><80><99>s workforce, where creativity and innovation are paramount to survival. There is a wide array of courses available online today for students in kindergarten through university or adulthood that provide both enrichment and acceleration, and are based upon various individual interests, needs and ability levels. However, virtually every online instructor struggles with how to incorporate and nurture creativity in offering educational opportunities so students can demonstrate ways they can be creative in the classroom. Given the fact that not every student may be motivated to learn, each student needs to perceive their instructor as a caring human being and bond with the class. Because online teaching presents a format different than the face-to-face classroom model, creativity must be facilitated through online forums, discussion boards and postings. Human elements, such as humor, create bonding as instructor and students directly engage and interact with each other through using their imagination. Therefore, the first step in promoting creativity in an online course begins with hiring a creative instructor who sparks and appreciates creativity in others. Instructors must understand their students in order to deliver content that is meaningful and creative. Chapter Five provides a variety of strategies that encourage students to become active, not passive learners, who can learn from one another. By helping students learn to cope with frustration and failure, online instructors shape the curriculum in new and productive ways that pique their students<e2><80><99> curiosity and develop a <e2><80><98>can do<e2><80><99> attitude or growth mindset. Chapter Five concludes with a list of creative new technologies instructors can employ to challenge students to experience learning in many, different ways. Personal and professional individual successes are dependent upon students becoming divergent thinkers who are equipped to analyze problems and create new solutions in an ever-changing world. Online instructors are encouraged to continually self-assess and examine their teaching practices and course designs to address the needs of providing opportunities for creativity to emerge.

A spiking neural network (SNN) is used to model the neuromodulatory function for generating context based behavioral responses of the robots to sensory input signals. The neural network incorporates three types of neurons-cholinergic and noradrenergic (ACh/NE) neurons for attention focusing and action selection, dopaminergic (DA) neurons for rewards-and curiosity-seeking, and serotonergic (5-HT) neurons for risk aversion behaviors. The model depicts description of neuron activity that is biologically realistic but computationally efficient to allow for large-scale simulation of thousands of neurons. The model is implemented using graphics processing units (GPUs) for parallel computing in real-time using the ROS environment. The model is implemented to study the risk-taking, risk-aversive, and distracted behaviors of the neuromodulated robots in single-and multi-robot configurations. The entire process is implemented in a distributed computing framework using ROS where the robots communicate wirelessly with the computing nodes through the on-board laptops. Results are presented for both single-and multi-robot configurations demonstrating interesting behaviors.","Muhammad, Cameron and Samanta, Biswanath",0,,644
882,What does curiosity really do to the cat? A look at how message exposure can lead to illicit drug trial Among College Students,"This study examines how exposure to media messages about drugs leads to curiosity about illicit drugs, which, in turn, can lead to illicit drug trial among interested college students. The Model of Product Curiosity (MPC; Smith & Swinyard, 1988) was used to predict the effects of exposure to drug messages on intention to try a ""new"" illegal drug. An experiment was performed with 172 undergraduate students to determine whether awareness, interest, and product curiosity affected intention to try a fictitious drug, MCA. Students were asked to listen to 1 of 4 radio segments with drug messages embedded in them. The results suggest that among students predisposed to try illicit drugs, repeated exposure to drug messages heightens awareness, interest, and curiosity about drugs, which, in turn, leads to an intention to try new drugs.

883,Leaders and the psychology of leadership,"Interest in leaders and leadership has been the subject of human curiosity and speculation for thousands of years. It has consumed hours of academic energy and page upon page in books, both scholarly and popular, and academic journals for the last seventeen years, especially since the advent of ""Executive Coaching"" in 1985. The field is simultaneously confusing and chaotic. What a leader is and does, how a leader is developed and selected is no better understood for the hours of study or articles written. Yet there is a crisis in American business, politics, and academia for the lack of leaders in their respective fields. This dissertation explores the problems in defining what a leader is and does, how they are chosen, especially in the corporate world, and what is expected of those who provide executive coaching. As such, it recognizes a void which professional psychology ought to fill theoretically, and to clarify academically through empirical means. Establishing the psychology of leadership as a specific body of knowledge and its practical application through executive coaching requires its recognition as a unique area of specialization within the field of psychology.

884,A study of lower-order and higher-order questions at secondary level,"In classrooms, questioning is one of the most regularly employed teaching strategies. Questioning is considered by many to be the most important tool that teachers have for helping students build understanding and to encourage students to think about and act upon the material that have structured. Questions are asked to individual pupils, to the whole class, to small groups to arouse curiosity, focus attention, develop an active approach, stimulate pupils, structure the task, diagnose difficulties, communicate expectation, help children reflect, develop thinking skills, help group reflection, provoke discussion and show interest in pupils' ideas. Perhaps few studies have been carried out regarding the levels of classroom questions in Pakistan on this vital aspect of teaching learning process. The main objective of the study was to explore the levels of questions teachers asked during teaching at secondary level using bloom's taxonomy. It was focused to observe the ratio of lower and higher- order questions. It was an observational study of the descriptive method. The target population comp rised all theteachers of Working Folks Grammar School & College Peshawar. Twenty teachers of different subjects teaching at secondary level were randomly selected as sample of the study. Teachers were observed using an observational guide and audio recording were conducted. The researcher focused only the asked questions of the teachers. This study is significant because its findings and conclusions may stimulate teachers to improve their questioning behavior in order to develop and promote higher order thinking abilities. The result of the study showed that so much time was spent with teachers questioning the students. Most of the questions were low- level cognitive questions. Higher- order questions were also observed however, the ratio of these questions was very low. Total percentage of questions during 445 minutes was 60 percent. The whole number of questions was good but in most of the classes the number of questions was low. Among 267 questions 67 percent were knowledge based, 23 percent were comprehension based, 7 percent were application based, 2 percent were analysis based and 1 percent was synthesis based. However the ratio of evaluation based questions was zero.","Khan, W B and Inamullah, H M",0,10.5539/ass.v7n9p149,647

886,The Intangibles in the Early Childhood Classroom,"The early years are such formative years, when attitudes are being created, when habits are taking shape, when thoughts are being crystallized. This is when the very essence of each child is coming into being. These are the intangibles that educators may look for within early childhood settings. They must look towards the child care centers around the world, the nursery schools, the public schools, and in the home care settings. It is there, in these important places, where they want to create a place where each child wants to be. For without that physical and emotional comfort the possibility of learning is greatly diminished. So from the very beginning, from the first steps away from home, educators must take it upon themselves to think in depth, to plan for, organize, and thoughtfully build an environment that beckons the best both ""for"" and ""from"" the children. An overarching belief for educators of young children is to foster ""a zest for learning"", to cultivate an ""ongoing curiosity"" about the world they live in, that is both vibrant and self-sustaining. They feel the importance of fostering and establishing ""an inextinguishable enthusiasm about the joy and the process of gaining new knowledge,"" assuring that it engenders in young children a sustained interest and involvement. The author calls for all classrooms, no matter what their level of sophistication, to be vessels of interest and challenge in which young minds and bodies have the freedom to explore new areas of thought and experience; to seek the intangibles outlined in this article.","Hillman, Carol B",0,,649

Is it possible to teach inquiry skills systematically and to engage learners in being inquirers across elementary, secondary, and post-secondary schooling? To answer these urgent questions, this book (1) pulls together more than four decades of expert opinion, quantitative research, and qualitative research on inquiry in different disciplines, school subjects, and levels of education; and (2) presents a dozen different pedagogical, philosophical, and disciplinary traditions within which evidence and rationale are found for building learning and teaching experiences around inquiry-based curricula.

Understanding their reasons for delaying or initiating first-time vaginal intercourse is important in designing culturally relevant health promotion programs. Using qualitative methods, we analyzed 21 semi-structured interviews with US Latino adolescents regarding their sexual initiations. Seven had sexually debuted, acknowledging sexual feelings of desire, curiosity and pleasure for their romantic partner. The remaining 14 had not debuted citing reasons of self-interest and external prohibitive factors. Eight out of 14 also attributed their status to not being in a romantic relationship. Our findings suggest several areas for increased discussion including how romantic relationships and Latino cultural values influence sexual initiation and the use of contraception. These findings could improve health promotion programs by identifying critical elements that may resonate with US Latino adolescent socio-cultural values and sexual development.","Useche, Bernardo and Medina, Gilda and Ross, Michael W and Markham, Christine",0,10.11144/Javeriana.UPSY13-4.ycag,654

895,Enrichment of the Educational Psychology Curriculum through Clinical Experiences,"An educational psychology curriculum for preservice teachers that attempts to overcome some of the shortcomings of most such curricula while providing clinical experience is described. The curriculum is based on three major propositions: (1) preservice teachers must acquire psychologically informed inquiry skills and a general understanding of when and how they are to be used; (2) preservice teachers must be encouraged to learn independently in ways that reinforce critical thinking and increase the strength and range of their intellectual curiosity; and (3) educational psychology is an appropriate place to begin encouraging prospective teachers to be reflective so they can learn from teaching itself. The curriculum is confined to the traditional subfields of motivation, human development, learning theory, and evaluation. Teaching is primarily interactive, with small-group work, micro teaching, simulation, discussion, and question-and-answer sessions. Weekly field-based or clinical laboratory activities for 90 minutes augment classroom instruction. Among the requirements is that students present a five-lesson mini-course to middle-school students. The grading system transfers some of the evaluative responsibility to the students themselves. Student interest, involvement, and achievement are indicators of the value of this curricular approach.

Only a few years ago some thought the secret was revealed in the socialized recitation; this was rapidly superseded by the project method; which in turn has given way to activity programs. Now each of these people and movements, with many others, has found something. Vital attack in teaching involves not one formula but many. We have no more reason to expect to find one panacea in the art of teaching than in the art of healing. Vital attack is more like the entrances to a temple which has many doors, any one of which leads to the interior. There is, however, one door, known as the front door, which leads directly to the main reception hall around which all the other rooms of the temple are arranged and from which they may be most readily explored. Similarity in teaching there appears to be a front door of approach which leads directly to the heart of the subject before us and from which all other aspects of the subject gain significance and interest. This is the method of direct attack. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Ruediger, William Carl",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/14529-001,657
897,Information seeking and use in the context of minimalist lifestyles,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe information seeking and use (ISU) within the context of minimalist lifestyles and connect characteristics of living with less to theories of information poverty and resilience. Design/methodology/approach - Naturalistic methods of inquiry describe minimalist lifestyles in a remote, rural context through semi-structured interviews with 24 adults. Environmental scanning and visual methods extended data collection retrospectively and longitudinally to span almost 118 years of community history. Qualitative thematic coding and analysis proceeded inductively and reflexively. Findings - Living minimally in this environment results in adaptive strategies that compensate for lack of resources in general, and information resources specifically. Positive psycho-social attitudes such as optimism, creativity, curiosity, resourcefulness, and self-sufficiency continue to be important factors in developing resilience in information seeking practices. Research limitations/implications - Information poverty is usually defined relatively, and often in relation to formal, macro-level environments. Focussing attention on informal, local level ISU reveals alternate varieties of knowledge, ways of knowing and characteristics that create information resilience in the face of sometimes profound deficits. Practical implications - Highlights of positive aspects to ISU in this remote, rural context will be of interest to researchers and practitioners serving rural library systems. Originality/value - This study provides an historical and contemporary glimpse into the ISU patterns of a previously unexamined population and context, those who live minimalist lifestyles in a remote and rural location.","Pollak, Angela",0,10.1108/JD-03-2016-0035,658
899,MMPI-2 predictors of Gray's two-factor reinforcement sensitivity theory,"This study examined the utility of the MMPI-2 to predict Gray's BIS/BAS dimensions in a sample of 193 Spanish undergraduates. Although the MMPI-2 is composed of numerous scale indices, we focused on the clinical, content, and the Personality Psychopathology-Five (PSY-5) scales. Overall, findings confirmed hypothesized associations between BIS/BAS factors and MMPI-2 indices. BIS scores demonstrated strong, positive relationships with numerous indices of anxiety, neuroticism, and negative affect, whereas BAS scores were positively related to indices of impulsivity, positive affect, disinhibition, extraversion, and anger. Multiple regression analyses further highlighted PSY-5 Negative Emotionality/Neuroticism scale and content scales of Low Self-esteem and Anxiety as predictors of BIS activity. By contrast, BAS activity was predicted by PSY-5 Positive Emotionality/Extraversion scale, the content scale of Type A Behavior, and the clinical scale of Hypomania. As expected, PSY-5 Constraint scale was a potent predictor of both BIS (positively) and BAS (negatively). Of particular interest, PSY-5 Aggressiveness scale predicted BIS and not BAS activity. Implications of these multivariate formulas for the assessment of BIS and BAS dimensions using the MMPI-2 are discussed.

900,Personality and curiosity about morbid and sexual events,"The study was designed to examine the relationships of sensation seeking, extraversion, neuroticism and psychoticism traits with an interest in presentations of violent or morbid and sexual events in the media and in live sports. Scales of curiosity about morbid and sexual events and self-ratings of attendance of horror and X-rated erotic movies were developed and given to 89 male and 213 female undergraduates along with the personality scales. Males scored higher than females on both types of curiosity and film attendance scales as well as on the SSS and P scale. The SSS and P scale correlated positively with curiosity scales and sensation seeking also correlated with film attendance of both types of films. A new hypothesis suggests that high sensation seekers are interested in stimuli that increase activity in central catecholamine systems. Past research has demonstrated that violent, fear-provoking and erotic films increase peripheral catecholamines. <c2><a9> 1986.","Zuckerman, Marvin and Litle, Patrick",0,10.1016/0191-8869(86)90107-8,660

Building on the success of previous experiences in the area of serious games, we are investigating the potential of situational curiosity and serendipity to increase the retention of historical facts. We present a game designed to explore networks of relationships among the topics of upcoming classes (not necessarily History ones) and topics that may be of interest to their students in a given place and/or on a given date. The design of the game's concept is supported by an intelligent system that uses DBpedia and YAGO as the main sources of knowledge in the search for semantic links among concepts.

902,Executive information seeking and the corporate library,"This study began with an interest in corporate libraries and a genuine curiosity in the information preferences and resources valued by executive leaders at JET Aircraft Co. Executive information preferences and the downward trend in special libraries initiated the investigation of information seeking among executive leaders and yielded the inquiry: What resources do JET Aircraft Co. executives value when they need information? Employing an ethnographic approach, this study investigated what JET Aircraft Co. executives know about information resources, what they believe about information resources, and how they act when they require information. While JET Aircraft Co. maintained a special corporate library called the Company Research Library (CRL), the purpose of this study was to determine what resources were of value to executives at JET Aircraft Co., understanding that the CRL may or may not be a resource executives' value. As a byproduct, this study also sought to establish executive information preferences and perceptions of the CRL. Information seeking at the executive level, studied through an ethnographic lens, provided insight into how executives at JET Aircraft Co. work and what they prefer, and it established a baseline for the Company Research Library's position among the resources valued by executives.

Even though instructors may not have an especially broad background in the Humanities, the students themselves bring their own set of interests to the course. The students' curiosity for their already existing interests can be exploited to broaden the course and to help them see connections between methodologies and subjects.

907,How to Read a Research Paper: An Exercise in Critical Thinking in the Context of an Epidemiologic Study on Tamsulosin and the Risk of Dementia,"A recent study of the relationship between tarnsulosin and dementia found that, in propensity score-matched analyses that adjusted for measured risk factors for dementia, the use of tamsulosin to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was associated with a small but significant increase in the risk of incident dementia relative to untreated BPH, BPH treated with the 50-reductase inhibitors dutasteride and finasteride, and BPH treated with the a adrenoceptor blockers doxazosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin. The choice of control groups addressed confounding by indication, confounding by disease severity, and confounding by pharmacologic drug class The authors of the study provided a wealth of detail in their main paper and in supplementary materials, allowing an almost forensic examination of the findings. This article discusses the study from the perspective of whether the hypothesis relating tamsulosin to dementia was set a priori or emerged after an exploratory exercise; whether tarnsulosin crosses the blood-brain barrier for dementia as the event of interest to be attributable to treatment; whether the action of tamsulosin is plausibly related to dementia as a possible outcome; whether confounding was adequately addressed in the analyses; whether the duration of follow-up was sufficient for the event of interest to be attributable to tamsulosin; whether the absolute increase in the rate of incident dementia was clinically significant; and what the curiosities in the dose-dependence and subgroup analysis findings could imply. These matters provide considerable food for thought Thus, this article is intended to serve as an example of how to read a paper critically and how to think about what the findings might suggest.","Andrade, Chittaranjan",0,10.4088/JCP.18112660,664
908,"Kisagotami, Buddha, and mustard seeds: An existential psychological perspective","As interest in Eastern thought continues to increase in Western societies, psychologists and psychology students in India, China, Japan, and other Asian countries are rigorously studying the history and methods of the Western tradition as the use of psychotherapeutic interventions is rapidly expanding there. This cross cultural dialogue is becoming more frequent and lively as clinicians and researchers travel more regularly between cultures. Curiosity and dynamism continue to hold off the dogmatism that can be present in both traditions, and due to their openmindedness. Western existential psychology and Eastern Buddhism seem to be at the forefront of this exchange. In fact, many of the fundamental questions and conclusions of existentialism and Buddhism are analogous. While both traditions value rigorous scientific and philosophical examination, both also use the creative arts and narratives to go beyond reductionist paradigms and engage multiple ways of knowing. This chapter recalls some common stories about Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, to highlight these similarities and to consider their implications for the practice of psychology and psychotherapy. While some fundamentalist Buddhist scholars prescribe to singular interpretations, or even a literal understanding of these stories, the vast majority of teachers and scholars encourage students to contemplate their meaning not only intellectually, but personally. In fact, the historical information about the actual life of the Buddha, similar to that regarding the life of Christ, was not codified until after his death. The earliest biographies of the Buddha were written more than five hundred years after his death and most stories have multiple versions, each of which has been influenced by the culture, historical background, and the interests of the writer. One of the best examples is the multiple versions of a story of Kisagotami. Depending upon the source, Kisagotami can be described as tall, thin, restrained, and unattractive (Hecker, 1982), or pretty, well-spoken, and a cousin of the Buddha (Tisdale, 2006). While these details may carry important information for cultural studies scholars, from a general existential perspective, and particularly for the purpose of this chapter, they are tertiary, as the poignancy of the story transcends these demographic variables. The following summary is drawn from multiple sources in order to capture the essence of the existential messages of the story with particular emphasis placed on the translations from the earliest Pali version (Bhushan, 2008; Gyasto, 1992; Hecker, 1982; Lillie, 1881; Murcott, 2006; Nikaya, 1930; Therigatha, 1883; Tisdale, 2006; Udana, 1948; Weeraperuma, 2006).

909,Using common elements to explain electromagnetism to children: Remote Laboratory of Electromagnetic Crane,"It is important to bring engineering to young people, and it is better to do so at an early age. In this case, the goal is to show children aged 10-15 years how electromagnetism works, and how we can find it in common tools that surround us. To do so, we are developing a remote laboratory that will be used in the sessions of science and technology in a school. Concept of electromagnetic crane has been chosen because a crane is a common tool. It is an object used in construction and in factories. Using electromagnet power to move metal objects is also a common concept that children can understand. Using these tools as an example, we seek to bring science to everyday life and promote the interests of children and young people in engineering and technology. The aim is to encourage them to seek education in engineering programs in the future, and teach them to understand and appreciate how important technology is. Initially, the laboratory will move left and right in a circumference of 350 degrees and permit up and down different preselected masses. Also, students can increase or decrease the voltage of the electromagnet to raise masses. The entire system will be accessible remotely by the student who will be able to move the crane, activate or deactivate the electromagnet, and lift or take down the masses. At the same time, the user interface displays the image of the laboratory and a graph showing the relationship between the power and its capacity to lift the mass every time the student applies voltage to the solenoid. All of this will allow us to see the effect that the applied voltage has over lifting the mass. This work in progress is associated with different learning environments to adjust the experience at different ages which range between 10 and 15 years. The students will interact with the remote laboratory from their homes, but also, the laboratory can be used in the classroom taking advantage of the data displayed through the user interface. Another objective is to show how engineering and science allow us to control remote objects and measure their effects through technology. Planting in students the seed of curiosity may be a good way to arouse the interest of future engineers.","Carro Fernandez, German and Carrasco Borrego, Ramon and Sancristobal and Ruiz, Elio and Castro Gil, Manuel and Mur Perez, Francisco",0,,666
910,Introduction,"The first paper on the subject of an analyst's pregnancy appeared more than 50 years ago, and was followed by a complete silence on the subject for the following 17 years. Slowly, a few substantial papers began to emerge, and there has been a gradual expansion in this area of the psychoanalytic literature particularly over the past 25 years, so that by now we have at least 60 papers on the subject, several chapters in books, and at least one complete book that I am aware of. There is of course a substantial separate literature on the subject of pregnancy itself, which is of direct relevance to an understanding of the subject of the analyst's pregnancy. In addition, the literature on special events in the course of therapy is pertinent to the subject too. I have limited my own review of the literature specifically to that related to the analyst's pregnancy but I have included all the references I could trace in the bibliography at the end of this issue. I have grouped the papers to some extent around key areas of interest as they emerge from the whole literature. In particular, I have noted that the earliest papers began to outline some generic responses to the analyst's pregnancy, ranging in intensity from supposedly minor turbulence in men to intense transference storms in women. The early papers seem to have regarded pregnancy solely as an interference in the treatment process. Later papers began to place more emphasis on the analyst's countertransference response and to acknowledge that the therapist herself is confronted at this time with issues involving her own identity, integration of new roles, maternal identification and redefinition of important relationships in her own life. At the same time she is having to find a way of functioning as an analyst in the face of intensified transference reactions. If the analyst can negotiate the challenges to her own pre-existing psychological equilibrium which pregnancy confronts her with, she will be better placed to address the stormy period in therapy which her pregnancy is likely to provoke in her patients, and some therapeutic gains can be made over this phase of the analysis. Later papers attempt to differentiate male from female responses to the pregnancy, and the demarcation is not surprisingly found to track psychosexual development along familiar gender lines. Examination of responses of homosexual patients, whether male or female, emphasizes the point. In addition, attempts to differentiate responses to the event according to the core psychopathology in the patient, confirm the pattern of anxieties and defences to be expected in particular configurations. A few papers examine the responses of patients to the therapist's pregnancy in different treatment modalities, and although there is some evidence to suggest that patients having group treatment are more likely to present with issues of sexual curiosity, sexual identity, or sibling rivalry, compared with patients in individual therapy, in the final analysis all patients confirm a core complex of fear of abandonment and feelings of loss of the fantasized exclusive mother-infant relationship. There is very little discussion in the literature on the impact of an analyst's absence due to unsuccessful pregnancies and it is postulated that this remains an area of great difficulty for the patient and the analyst, to the extent that it is almost obliterated. I can find only three papers on this topic. However, a few papers are published on the patients' responses to an analyst who has had two pregnancies. While this constitutes a particularly complex challenge to both patient and analyst, the overview suggests that there are additional therapeutic gains to be made in terms of working through, in the course of the second pregnancy. Numerous authors address the subject of the inevitable changes in technique that follow from the fact of the analyst's pregnancy. Some of these changes are felt to be directly related to the physical and psychological changes with which the therapist is confronted at this time, and by association so is her patient. The more these changes can be acknowledged by the therapist, within herself, the more likely it is that she will be able to continue to function as an analyst. It is also apparent that the role of the supervisor is of particular importance during and immediately following this life-changing event (Imber 1995, Goldberger et al. 2003) and this is described in some detail in these two recent papers. <c2><a9> 2004 The Association for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in the NHS.","Whyte, N",0,10.1080/14749730410001656480,667
911,DIFFERENT CULTURES DIFFERENT VALUES: IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING AND,"This session is designed to demonstrate to the participants how global citizenship can be taught from social studies thematic unit with the use of multiple literacies and technology. Social studies discipline is an indispensable channel in providing multiple literacies and integrated learning for global citizenship to the whole child, teachers and community. Through its interdisciplinary approach, students will become aware of different world cultures and values. The use of technology in social studies instruction facilitates learning and increases students' curiosity in social and global issues. It also stimulates their interest in problem solving and decision making; thus preparing them to become active and responsible citizens of their country and the world. Multiple literacies with emphasis given to strategies for curriculum integration and learning, can expand intellectual horizon and break down borders between cultures and countries, even as it contributes to a better understanding of ourselves, our country and our world. This session will increase participants' capacity to integrate into their curriculum global consciousness and appropriately utilize technology in educating and assessing performance. Multiple literacies through interdisciplinary approach, designed by pre-service teachers in my social studies methods class, will be examined to show how global citizenship and sensitivity to human differences can affect the development of the whole child, teachers and community. Finally, participants will develop plans for integrating their ideas into teaching frameworks for example, instructional methods, activities, and lesson plans or curriculum unit that could be used in their schools or at various levels of instruction (Pk -12).","Henshaw, Elizabeth U and Buote, Kerren",0,,668
913,Personal practices for emancipatory systems change,"Applications of systems theory have been long understood to be effective in the interest of organizational change (e.g., Argyris & Schon, 1978), but systems interventions are largely inaccessible to people without the power or resources to facilitate them. Moreover, systems interventions are not always dedicated to social and ecological justice, or emancipatory change, change that promotes flourishing for people in the system, and for people, communities and ecologies affected by the system. The literatures of applied systems thinking (e.g., Senge, 1990 & 2006), critical systems thinking (Flood, 1999), collective wisdom (e.g., Briskin, Erickson, Ott & Callanan, 2009), complexity theory (e.g., Stacey, 2008), critical race theory (e.g., Delgado & Stefancic, 2001), presencing (e.g., Scharmer, 2009); and nonviolence (e.g., Kurlansky, 2006) imply the possibility that personal practices can promote emancipatory systems change. This study explored the questions: Is it possible for personal practices to support emancipatory change, or perturb a system to emancipatory change? If so, what are those practices? I applied a phenomenological approach to interpret transcripts from conversations with 30 participants with varied experiences across sectors and types of organizations. Based on those findings, I have suggested that intentional personal practices can perturb a system in the direction of emancipatory change, even in the face of resistance to such change. These practices are categorized in postures of curiosity, humility, mindfulness, respect, generosity, and nonviolence. I suggest some practices as foundational to emancipatory change and other practices in response to three sources of resistance to emancipatory change, which I identify as internal limitations, fear, and limiting morality.

914,The duality of the trait of curiosity and its role in self-rating questionnaires,"Since Antiquity, curiosity has been considered both in a positive and negative way. Some authors have put forward its important role in the search for truth and knowledge, while others have condemned the frivolous quest for new experiences. Contemporary research in psychology meets the opinion of antique philosophers and gives empirical support to the hypothesis of a basic duality of trait-curiosity. Different terms are used to designate the two components (opposition between breadth and depth of interest, perceptual and epistemic curiosity, or experience versus information seeking) but, beyond terminological divergences, the descriptions converge. One facet of the trait has to do with the attraction toward novelty (neophilia), the other one with the need to understand (epistemic component). The relationship between these two facets and two other traits, sensation seeking and need for cognition, is underlined. Various self-report questionnaires are briefly described and the way they assess the duality of trait curiosity is examined.

915,Gender and Motivational Orientation among High School Students,"This study explored possible gender differences in intrinsic motivation among 120 white students at a semi-rural high school. Researchers drew students randomly from each of the four grade levels. Students provided information on age, grade level, and grade point average, then anonymously completed Harter's 1981 Scale of Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Motivation. The Scale included five subscales grouped into two central components. The Mastery Motivation component was measured by three subscales: (1) preference for challenge versus preference for easy work assigned, (2) learning out of curiosity/interest versus pleasing the teacher or getting grades, and (3) independent mastery versus dependence on the teacher. The Autonomous Judgment component was measured by two additional subscales: (4) independent judgement versus reliance on the teacher's judgment, and (5) internal versus external criteria for assessing success or failure in school. Data analysis indicated that girls were significantly more intrinsic on autonomous judgement components and the judgement subscale. There were no significant differences on the mastery motivation component and the four other subscales. Grade point average positively correlated with mastery motivation for both sexes. Autonomous judgement significantly correlated with grades for girls but not boys. Overall, boys and girls had similar intrinsic motivation. (Contains 2 tables and 13 references.)

916,Art in the Garden,"Meadow Woods Elementary in Orlando, Florida has a garden ceremony at the end of each year. This is a time when the whole school gathers together to celebrate another successful school year. The classrooms are built around the garden, so it is the centerpiece of the school. Students always do an art project for this ceremony. One year, students made visors to wear to the ceremony, and students stepping stones for the garden. This year the project was to paint a shed, which is in the center of the garden. The project naturally led into discussions of art concepts. For instance, while painting the caterpillar's body, first grade students discovered that there are many shades of green. Fourth grade students learned that the way light hits a subject creates depth. Fifth grade students were challenged by using a vanishing point and perspective when painting the scene of a city street for their character, Maniac Magee. Every painting became a lesson on color mixing. The paintings also created interest in literature. Each time a class entered the artroom, discussion began with what grade was working on which character. Even the youngest students wanted to name each one, and they were excited to see the progress happening before their eyes. The black stallion painting sparked the curiosity of third graders, and now they look forward to reading that book in fourth grade. The same is true for the other paintings. Hopefully, the project will encourage all students to read these books and continue to expand their knowledge through literacy.","Tucciarelli, Teri",0,,672

ER-Ps were calculated separately for drawings that were viewed longer or shorter than the median viewing time of each participant. The drawings viewed longer elicited a larger anterior negativity (N2) peaking at 245 ms than the shorter viewed drawings. This effect disappeared and the overall amplitude of the N2 decreased when the same set of drawings was presented again in a subsequent interest-rating session. Drawings rated as more interesting elicited a larger N2 than did drawings rated as less interesting. This study demonstrates a type of anterior N2 that is sensitive to stimulus unfamiliarity or difficulty in encoding, which reflects a conflict between stimulus input and existing knowledge and prompts further recognition processes and visual exploration.","Nittono, Hiroshi and Shibuya, Yoshie and Hori, Tadao",0,10.1111/j.1469-8986.2007.00539.x,675

924,Review of Personalising public services: Understanding the personalisation narrative,"Reviews the book, Personalising Public Services: Understanding the Personalisation Narrative by C. Needham (2011). In this book, C. Needham defines personalization as 'a set of stories that were being told about public services and the people who use and work in them, that together constituted a narrative of public service reform'. The author analyzes evidence is drawn from policy documents, interviews with prominent actors, and participant observations at personalization events. The analysis of this evidence is informed by a type of interpretive policy analysis that places particular emphasis on the narrative facets of policy. The reviewer believes that this book is likely to be of interest to readers with a curiosity in how welfare policies develop. Critics of personalization may take for granted the freedoms from state coercion won by disabled people. This does not, however, mean one should condemn criticisms of personalization and assume they imply support for paternalism. Needham's text is apposite in this regard, remaining ambivalent, and balancing the progressive aspects of personalization with the depressing likelihood it is these aspects that are least likely to be realized in today's context.

925,Modeling the Activities of Scientists: Prospective Science Teachers' Poster Presentations in An STS Course,"In this study, prospective science teachers' (PSTs) views about their poster presentations were investigated. These posters were developed through PSTs' online and library research and scientific mini-symposiums in chemistry related topics in the framework of science, technology and society course (STS). During the first four weeks of STS course, PSTs (N=50) were taught about some important issues such as the goals for teaching science through STS, the topics to be taught, how the science and STS content be integrated, how to design STS instruction and how to prepare and present a poster. Fifty PSTs were grouped in small groups of four or five and freely selected their research projects in chemistry topics involving STS content. After their on-line and library research and scientific mini-symposiums, PSTs presented the poster presentations of their studies to all of students and educators in the faculty of education as a group of scientists in a manner of a scientific meeting and responded the questions of the visitors related to their posters toward the end of the STS course. Then, semi-structured interviews developed by the researchers were carried out with PSTs in small groups to identify PSTs' views about their poster presentations. The results of small-group interviews showed that PSTs described their poster presentations as a funny way of learning and they stated that they understood how the scientific developments are achieved by cooperative working which enabled them to feel as scientists. They also stated that this improved their self-confidence. They expressed that their poster presentations made the knowledge they gained in STS course more permanent and increased their curiosity and interest toward STS issues. Appended are: (1) Some photographs of PSTs' posters and poster presentations.","Dogan, Alev and Kaya, Osman Nafiz and Kilic, Ziya and Kilic, Esma and Aydogdu, Mustafa",0,,678
926,"Learning benefits of secondary school students' inquiry-related curiosity: A cross-grade comparison of the relationships among learning experiences, curiosity, engagement, and inquiry abilities","This study addresses the issue of curiosity-driven inquiry learning by examining the interplay among students' inquiry-related curiosity, laboratory engagement, and inquiry abilities and investigates how their learning experiences would associate with such interplay. We employed structural equation modeling to analyze data collected from 920 eighth graders and 1,090 eleventh graders, including their performances on a multimedia-based assessment of scientific inquiry abilities and their responses to items in an online questionnaire. The results revealed that, for students from both grades, inquiry-related curiosity was associated with their inquiry abilities, and that the association was mediated by their inquiry-related laboratory engagement. Furthermore, the analyses showed that both formal and informal experiences were associated with the laboratory engagement of students from both grades through curiosity. Yet, the results indicated that, although the roles of the two types of experiences varied in the associations, formal science experience had stronger associations with students' inquiry abilities than informal science experience for both graders. Taken together, this study supports the importance of having curiosity-driven engagement and suggests that the science education community should collaboratively offer secondary school students such learning opportunities in formal and informal science learning settings.","Wu, Pai-Hsing and Kuo, Che-Yu and Wu, Hsin-Kai and Jen, Tsung-Hau and Hsu, Ying-Shao",0,10.1002/sce.21456,679
929,Curiosity and Motivation,"Curiosity is an old, intriguing, and vexing construct in the psychology of motivation. This chapter reviews the major strands of thought on curiosity and motivation: (1) curiosity as a motive to reduce negative states, such as uncertainty, novelty, arousal, drive, or information gaps; (2) curiosity as a source of intrinsic motivation that fosters learning and exploring for their own sakes; and (3) curiosity as a stable motivational difference between people that leads to differences in knowledge, goals, achievement, and experience. The scope of psychological thought on curiosity defies a simple integration, but it offers inspiration for researchers curious about why people learn and explore in the absence of obvious external rewards. <c2><a9> Universiyt Press, 2014.","Silvia, P J",0,10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195399820.013.0010,680

931,Emotional reactions to human reproductive cloning,"Background Extant surveys of people's attitudes towards human reproductive cloning focus on moral judgements alone, not emotional reactions or sentiments. This is especially important given that some (especially Leon Kass) have argued against such cloning on the ground that it engenders widespread negative emotions, like disgust, that provide a moral guide. Objective To provide some data on emotional reactions to human cloning, with a focus on repugnance, given its prominence in the literature. Methods This brief mixed-method study measures the self-reported attitudes and emotions ( positive or negative) towards cloning from a sample of participants in the USA. Results Most participants condemned cloning as immoral and said it should be illegal. The most commonly reported positive sentiment was by far interest/curiosity. Negative emotions were much more varied, but anxiety was the most common. Only about a third of participants selected disgust or repugnance as something they felt, and an even smaller portion had this emotion come to mind prior to seeing a list of options. Conclusions Participants felt primarily interested and anxious about human reproductive cloning. They did not primarily feel disgust or repugnance. This provides initial empirical evidence that such a reaction is not appropriately widespread.","May, J",0,10.1136/medethics-2015-102738,682
935,"Incentive motivation, conditioning, stress, and neuropsychiatric disorders: A tribute to Jane Stewart","Jane Stewart has been a leader whose contributions over the past half-century have profoundly influenced these fields. In an era of increasing specialization and exponential growth in the number of publications, her research interests have remained exceptionally broad, reflecting her genuine interest in understanding how the brain controls behavior. Jane Stewart received her Ph.D. in 1959 from the University of London, England. In her dissertation work she characterized the ability of a light cue to serve as an operant reinforcer in the rat, a phenomenon that has become important many years later for the understanding of nicotine's rewarding effects. This Special Issue contains empirical papers and reviews that reflect her contributions both as a scientist and as an educator. The breadth of her scientific contributions is reflected in the diversity of topics included here in these papers by her collaborators, colleagues, and trainees. As an educator, Jane has had a deep and lasting influence on all of us who were fortunate enough to work with her. Jane demands scholarship and precision from her trainees. Her genuine curiosity about the brain and behavior is infectious to those who work with her, and she is only satisfied with the most rigorous scientific standards to address the research questions.

937,Decomposing perceived playfulness: A contextual examination of two social networking sites,"Social networking sites (SNSs) are focused on providing playful services for users that will keep them engaged without losing their interest. Perceived playfulness is derived from the user's subjective evaluation of their interaction with technology and is represented through the subdimensions: concentration, enjoyment, and curiosity. Results show that there is a positive association between perceived playfulness and their attitude toward using the technology. However, the existing studies do not provide a clear direction about conceptualizing and measuring the subdimensions of perceived playfulness. The lack of conclusive evidence, despite the IS literature, shows the need for more empirical studies investigating the actual effect of the distinct subdimensions of perceived playfulness across various contexts. This study develops a context-specific model by decomposing playfulness to completely identify the extent to which specific dimensions are influencing the user's attitude and further clarify their relative importance. An empirical study was conducted with a total sample size of 551 participants, from two different types of SNSs, to test the context-specific model. The results showed that the relative importance of the subdimensions is significantly different between the two SNSs. The findings make the relationship between perceived playfulness and the user's attitude more context sensitive and provide a useful guide to formulating greater user experience in constructing SNS services.

938,Values of students and their ratings of a university professor,"Reports on the personality variables of college students as related to the performance of a college professor. Ss were 109 males and 83 females in a university class. Ss responded on the Allport, Vernon, Lindsey Study of Values, on a part of the Purdue Rating Scale for Instruction and on a biographical inventory. The following dimensions of instructor performance were rated by the Ss: interest in subject, sympathetic attitudes toward students, fairness in grading, liberal and progressive attitudes, presentation of subject matter, sense of humor, self-reliance and confidence, personal appearance and ability to stimulate intellectual curiosity. The interactions between instructor performance and student values were based on the theoretical, economic, aesthetic, political and religious values of the Ss in addition to their sex and grade expected. Nine out of 60 possible effects and 13 out of 240 possible interactions between the effects of behavior dimensions of an instructor and student values were significant (p < .05).

940,Queriosity: Automated Data Exploration,"Curiosity, a fundamental drive amongst higher living organisms, is what enables exploration, learning and creativity. In our increasingly data-driven world, data exploration, i.e., making sense of mounting haystacks of data, is akin to intelligence for science, business and individuals. However, modern data systems - designed for data retrieval rather than exploration - only let us retrieve data and ask if it is interesting. This makes knowledge discovery a game of hit-and-trial which can only be orchestrated by expert data scientists. We present the vision toward Queriosity*, an automated and personalized data exploration system. Designed on the principles of autonomy, learning and usability, Queriosity envisions a paradigm shift in data exploration and aims to become a a personalized ``data robot'' that provides a direct answer to what is interesting in a user's data set, instead of just retrieving data. Queriosity autonomously and continuously navigates toward interesting findings based on trends, statistical properties and interactive user feedback.","Wasay, Abdul and Athanassoulis, Manos and Idreos, Stratos",0,10.1109/BigDataCongress.2015.116,687
943,Influences of stimulating tasks on reading motivation and comprehension,"One theoretical approach for increasing intrinsic motivation for reading consists of teachers using situational interest to encourage the development of long-term individual interest in reading. The authors investigated that possibility by using stimulating tasks, such as hands-on science observations and experiments, to increase situational interest. Concurrently, the authors provided books on the topics of the stimulating tasks and teacher guidance for reading to satisfy curiosities aroused from the tasks. Students with a high number of stimulating tasks increased their reading comprehension after controlling for initial comprehension more than did students in comparable intervention classrooms with fewer stimulating tasks. Students' motivation predicted their level of reading comprehension after controlling for initial comprehension. The number of stimulating tasks did not increase reading comprehension on a standardized test when motivation was controlled, suggesting that motivation mediated the effect of stimulating tasks on reading comprehension. Apparently, stimulating tasks in reading increased situational interest, which increased longer term intrinsic motivation and reading comprehension.","Guthrie, J T and Wigfield, A and Humenick, N M and Perencevich, K C and Taboada, A and Barbosa, P",0,10.3200/JOER.99.4.232-246,688
944,Aesthetics of the classical period of the Islamic Mughal empire in India through a portrait of AbÅ« al-Fatá¸¥ JalÄl al-DÄ«n Muá¸¥ammad Akbar,"The reign of Ab<c5><ab> al-Fat<e1><b8><a5> Jal<c4><81>l al-D<c4><ab>n Mu<e1><b8><a5>ammad Akbar (1556-1605) was a fruitful period of the political, cultural and spiritual synthesis of Persian, Indian, and European tradition, as well as an artistic and aesthetic renaissance. This cosmopolitan, universal and charismatic ruler strived for the external, political, material and spiritual well-being of his colourful empire. In search of a balance between the external and internal, and in his endeavours for the unification and uniformity of India he gradually created a completely new style of Mughal arts, which is a stunning reflection of his personality<e2><80><99>s transformations, principles, insights, interests, and spiritual growth. The paper focuses on a psychological portrait of the ruler, who dictated aesthetics and the style of the classical period of Mughal arts which consists of the three basic developmental phases of Akbar<e2><80><99>s enigmatic character. The thesis on the parallel development of Akbar<e2><80><99>s personality and Mughal arts is supported by research on the influence of certain European and Persian aesthetic elements, and mainly on the influence of Indian philosophical-religious tradition (the doctrines on rasa, bhakti, yoga, and tantra). The early period of Mughal arts, with predominantly realistic elements, coincides with the ruler<e2><80><99>s dynamic, youthful enthusiasm and immense curiosity to acquaint himself the most varied aspects of external events and appearances. The second, the mature period, which enriches this earlier realism by means of mystical elements and the symbolism of Indian pre-Mughal painting, is marked by the shift into the interior and by searching for the harmony between the material and spiritual. In the late period of Mughal painting, however, reflexive and lyrical works prevail, which are a reflection of completion of Akbar<e2><80><99>s spiritual quests, and the unique project of multifaceted synthesis that he undertook and promoted. <c2><a9> 2018, Ljubljana University Press.

945,Biology Teachers' Perceptions of Subject Matter Structure and Its Relationship to Classroom Practice,"Current reform efforts in the teaching of high school biology demonstrate the need for a synthetic treatment of prominent concepts. There exists insufficient research that delineates the global content understandings--in this paper designated subject matter structures (SMS)--of biology teachers; or that assesses whether these SMS do, in fact, translate themselves into classroom practices. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the nature of biology teachers' SMS and the relationship of these structures to classroom procedures. Case studies of five biology teachers from five different high schools in a small region of a western rural state were conducted utilizing interviews, classroom observations, anecdotal data, and analyses of instructional materials. In phase 1 of the study, initial interviews were held in order to construct an academic and professional profile of each teacher. In phase 2, each teacher was observed during 15 periods within the same semester. The data were analyzed qualitatively to determine which SMS the teachers demonstrated within the classroom teaching context. These observed-SMS were compared to the SMS provided by the teachers in post-observation interviews and to the SMS encouraged by the text. In general, teachers' SMS tended to be fragmented, indicating the absence of coherence necessary to the integration of biological concepts within classroom instruction. Mediating variables between teachers' SMS and their classroom techniques included teachers' intentions, knowledge of textbook content, pedagogical knowledge, student curiosity and level of interest, teacher autonomy, and time constraints.

949,Learning to Program by Playing Learning Games,"Game-based learning is an emerging field that has become a part of university education and several researchers describe its strong learning potential. For several subjects there is a rich flora of learning games and commercial-of-the-shelf games available, but for programming education in general and Python programming in particular, the situation is different. There exists an economical aspect as well and to develop learning games for programming education, might not interest the mainstream game industry and most universities do not have the resources needed to develop their own tailor-made learning games. Digital gaming in general has had a fast expansion during the last decade and the generation that now is entering the universities has a habit of regular gaming. At the same time there are several studies reporting about low motivated students in introductory programming courses. In a time when commercial games for programming education are rare, universities must look for affordable ways to construct appropriate learning games. This study has investigated the idea of using learning games developed by university students as additional learning tools in an introductory programming course. Five student constructed games for learning to program in Python have been analysed. Eventually two learning games were selected and tested as part of a five week introductory programming course. The overall strategy has been action research with the aim to improve an existing programming course. A group of students have played the games in two workshops where data has been collected in a mix of questionnaires, observations and group discussions. Findings indicate that the general idea seems to work, but as for all kind of course content, there need to be a thorough assessment and iterative refinement. Despite some found bugs and interface flaws the games had a challenging gameplay as well as learning outcomes. The game-based workshops also had a catalytic effect and created energy as well as curiosity among the participants. To what degree the games and the workshops contributed to concrete learning outcomes will be further analysed after the second examination deadline.","Olsson, Marie and Mozelius, Peter",0,,694

European folk musics are diverse and have been strongly tied to national and regional politics for at least 200 years. However, attempts to construct pan-European musical identities rest upon the notion of bringing forward new, original compositions based upon these numerous musical identities and often occur in the context of large-scale festival commissions. The music of La Banda Europa however was not politically motivated in its genesis; it grew initially from Jim Sutherland<e2><80><99>s artistic curiosity and interest in the cultural heritage of different folk traditions from around Europe.

Assessments of home environments and interest support between ages 4 and 5 years were used to predict different types of child interest profiles over an ensuing 24-month period. Subtle differences in home environments and parental attitudes were noticeable at interest inception between a subgroup of children who sustained long-term individual interests and a subgroup that did not. In particular, parents of children with long-term individual interests tended to place a heavier emphasis on academic stimulation, the role of curiosity in learning, and provided more interest-related materials in the home than parents of children with shorter-term interests. Implications for ontogenetic models of interest development are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The first study compares three different presentation formats: a video presentation and two Virtual Product Experience (VPE) presentations, namely, triggered interaction and full interaction. The findings suggest that triggered interaction VPE is more effective in enticing users to attend to and further explore the featured products than both the non-interactive video presentation and the full interaction VPE. The second study builds upon the first and focuses on two specific VPE design factors. In particular, it investigates interaction constraint (high versus low constraint) in addition to the activation mode of interaction (process-based interaction versus event-based interaction). The results reveal interesting interaction patterns between the two design factors, i.e., providing less constrained interaction performs better when process-based interaction design is adopted, but performs worse when event-based interaction is employed.","Yi, Cheng and Jiang, Zhenhui and Benbasat, Izak",0,,698
954,"It's not what you know...: Encounters, go-betweens and the geography of knowledge","Sometime in the 1760s, a Constantinople-born, French-educated Muslim arrived at the port of Balassor in north-east India. Known variously as Mustapha or Monsieur Raymond, he had, he later wrote, with a mediocre dictionary and a bad grammar, and by conversing with the ship's captain en route from Bombay, learned enough of English... as I might delight in Bolingbroke's Philosophical works. This student of contemporary intellectual history soon put his knowledge to work, securing a position translating for Robert Clive, the conquering hero of the English East India Company's new imperial administration in India. Subsequently falling from favour, Mustapha crossed over to seek employment with the English company's French rivals, earning himself a spell in prison as a spy. He also travelled to Mecca, where he gained the honorific Haji but lost his fortune, his cabinet of curiosities and his collection of books and manuscripts. He then became the keeper of a zenana (to the Europeans, a harem or seraglio), and he entered the world of publishing. In 1789, in Calcutta, Mustapha had printed for himself a pamphlet-length diatribe on the iniquitous administration of the law in British Bengal entitled Some Idea of the Civil and Criminal Courts of Justice at Moorshoodabad. In the same year he was also involved, as the pseudonymous editor Nota Manus, in the publication of a three-volume English translation of a Persian work of Indian history-Ghulam Hussain Khan Tabatabai's Seir Mutaqherin, or View of Modern Times (written in 1781-2)-which dealt with the British conquest and administration of Bengal, and offered a stern critique of the new rulers who seemed to have an aversion to the Society of Indians, and a disdain against conversing with them. Finally, Mustapha (who called himself a Semi-Englishman who had the interests of his adopted countrymen at heart) claimed to have published in London a work of futurology entitled State of Europe in 1800. In his encounters with Europeans, his travels within and beyond India (although he never made it to England as he had planned), and his involvement in the production of historical and geographical knowledge, Mustapha was deeply interested in that which shaped his own fortunes: the relationships of knowledge and power between Europe and other parts of the world. <c2><a9> 2013 Cambridge University Press.","Ogborn, M",0,10.1017/S147924431200039X,699
956,St. Leon and the culture of the heart,"This essay reads Godwin's second novel, St. Leon (1799), as an attempt to counter the asperity he expresses towards the domestic affections in his political philosophy of the 1790s. In St. Leon, Godwin seeks to square his newfound interest in the affections as a topic for fiction with his commitment to an anti-establishment political agenda. Though it is presented as a 'eulogium' to 'the affections and charities of private life', the narrative persistently undercuts the potential for the affections to stimulate readerly curiosity. The focus of the novel constantly shies away from the domestic scene, and instead propels the momentum forwards to the alchemical adventures that precipitate the disintegration of the very affections the novel purports to eulogise. The novel thus plays out Godwin's complicated desire to embrace, and yet simultaneously to deny, the importance of private emotions in the pursuit of political justice. <c2><a9> 2006.","Joy, L",0,10.1016/j.histeuroideas.2006.06.004,700

959,Before Freud: Hysteria and hypnosis in later nineteenth-century psychiatric cases,"Before Freud is an anthology of psychiatric case histories published between 1869 and 1894 by five leading medical practitioners: George Beard, Richard Krafft-Ebing, Arthur Schnitzler, Jean-Martin Charcot, and Pierre Janet. Most of the cases here are translated from German or French for the first time. The purpose of this collection is to make accessible to English speakers important primary documents crucial not only for the history of psychology but also for an understanding of the literature of the period. A brief introduction outlines the evolution of psychiatry from the eighteenth-century ""mad doctors'"" belief in demons through the nineteenth-century search for visible bodily lesions in the wake of discoveries in physical medicine to the recognition of the centrality of invisible neuroses in the patient's mind. Each section opens with a headnote that provides information about the writer as well as commentary on the significance of his ideas and methods in the context of the time. No prior knowledge either of the writers or of the history of psychiatry is assumed, and technical jargon is avoided or explained in lay terms. While scholarly, the volume aims to be eminently readable to those unfamiliar with the history of psychology/ psychiatry. The case histories themselves are so bizarre as to arouse curiosity. The work is also suitable for adoption in courses on the history of medicine--a rising discipline--and will certainly be of interest to students of nineteenth-century literature. To re-read Freud in light of his predecessors is to attain a better understanding of his immense contribution to the development of psychiatry. By introducing the ""talking cure"" he transformed the patient from a passive object to be silenced and restrained into an active participant in his/her treatment. Although still controversial, his innovative concepts on repression and the role of the unconscious have been widely assimilated into our culture. Current research in neuropsychiatry (e.g., Mark Solms et al.) revisits his theories and legitimizes them in scientific terms. This volume widens our horizon, enabling us to appreciate the leap forward that Freud made. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Furst, Lilian R",0,,702

The first of these powers is an original endowment; the second is a developed capacity. The examples of the development of this power which we have considered all occur under our direct observation. Experience is a decisive witness that the ability to make these combinations is acquired by every human being, by processes which we can more or less distinctly analyze. The exercise of this power involves all the constituents of induction. We propose next to treat of the acquisitions which are made before we can observe so as to remember; i.e., to trace the growth and development of the sense-perceptions in earliest infancy. We take our guidance from what we have observed of those processes which we are certain that we acquire, and, going back to that period of which memory brings no report, we ask, From what beginnings, in what order, and by what steps does the infant mind develop and mature the power of sense-perception of which it finds itself in possession, when it awakes to distinct and remembered consciousness? The problem is full of interest. It seems like a proposal to revive the experience of our earliest years, to restore, as it were, the forgotten past of our lives-the period when our curiosity was eager, our energy unabated, our hopes were boundless, and the universe was beckoning to us to explore and enjoy its infinitude. There is a mystery about those months and years which we would fain unravel, which tempts and tantalizes us because of its apparent darkness and obscurity. The difficulty and apparent insuperableness of the problem incite and challenge us to make the effort to follow the successive acts by which we 'build up the being which we are.' The difficulty which attends the effort arises from the fact that it is impossible, by memory, to bring back a single fragment of our infant life.

962,History of interest in the gifted,"Curiosity about the lives and works of talented individuals probably dates back to the time man first showed interest in why human beings are different from each other. Whenever and wherever persons have excelled in some culturally prized area of endeavor requiring outstanding ability, they have invariably aroused some degree of public curiosity, suspicion, appreciation, or antipathy, depending upon the temper of their audiences. Some have attracted attention to themselves as individuals, exclusive of their work; others, though unknown in their time, have left immortal legacies for succeeding generations. Some have caught the public eye in their lifetimes; others were not idolized (or pilloried) until after death. Classical and Western cultures have been deeply intrigued by the gifted, judging by the multitude of theories on the nature of genius and its impact on human affairs. Among ancient Greeks and medieval Europeans, for example, there existed a popular notion that genius is a divine gift, a touch of omniscience enabling one to penetrate into depths of Truth too remote for ordinary mortals. A contrasting theory among the ancients that has also gained wide acceptance in modern as well as ancient times is that the genius is emotionally aberrant and can be carried into flights of creativity only on wings of madness. Then too, extraordinary mental strength was once regarded by some as symptomatic of physical disease. Debate over the relative influence of the great man and his social milieu-whether it is the hero who makes history or history which makes the hero-has likewise raged for many years. Whatever the answer to this popular, age-old question, one fact seems clear: Concern with the major achievements of talented individuals through the ages is of more than passing interest in the study of history itself. This chapter discusses that the concern for talent has deep historical roots and the education of the gifted.

963,Contribution to the problem of the knowledge of man,"4 general groups interest themselves in sizing up persons: the naive (waiters, etc.); those whose work requires a quick decision (personnel managers, etc.); educated people interested in reading up on psychology; and those with true scientific curiosity and discrimination. By using a questionnaire designed to determine the processes by which personality estimates are arrived at, Brugger found that all groups relied on a schema of signs, the significance of which derived from the particular viewpoints, experiences, and purposes of each group. The judgments of group 1 are based on few signs; utilize suggestion and situations; and are often unconscious, confused, uncritical, and vague. Those of group 2 are drawn from practical experience and crystallize into formulas. Group 4 uses many and exact signs and stresses intellect rather than emotion. Nevertheless, a common trait unites these groups: the wish to understand man and a special aptitude for appreciation and judgment. No amount of study can replace native inclination, sensitivity, and recognition of the profound vibrations between man and man.

964,"Teaching with high probability-strategies in the elementary classroom to affect student engagement, learning, and success: An action research study","Engaged students have been described as intrinsically motivated by curiosity, interest, enjoyment, and a desire to achieve personal goals. Researchers have discovered that the instructional practices of teachers can have a direct impact on student engagement and student achievement. High-probability strategies (HPS) are research based best practices that effective teachers employ regularly and that may increase student engagement. This study was an attempt to determine if HPS significantly impact student engagement, student learning, and student achievement. Additional researchers have demonstrated that HPS encourage student engagement through the development of higher level thinking skills, student-centered instruction, and generation of genuine student interest in learning tasks. This study gathered data in the form of student test scores in Grade 3 English language arts prior to and after the intervention, student responses to the engagement survey, and teacher reports of student engagement. Results of 3 data sources were reported for this study. Analysis using t test and analysis of variance resulted in f-values of .382249 and 4.0 respectively. Neither of these results provided a significant difference in either the language arts test scores pre-/post-implementation of HPS or the pre/post National Center for Student Engagement Student Engagement Survey results. However, trend data supported that student language arts scores were higher during the 4th 6 weeks and that student composite scores from the Research Assessment Package for Schools Teacher Report of Student Engagement were higher during the same 4th 6-week grading period. The implications of these results indicate that research in student engagement should continue to be ongoing.

965,The Effect on Elementary Science Education Based on Student's Pre-Inquiry,"In this research, after extracting the pre-inquiries (student-level question) for which students had curiosity in the elementary science and analyzing their correlation with the elementary science curriculum, highly correlated inquiries (meaningful pre-inquiries) were selected and applied in class. After organizing an experiment group and a controlled group with one each class of 6th grade in two elementary schools which showed homogeneity in prior research. This study collected pre-inquiries from the experiment group through a questionnaire and together with a science education experts selected inquiries significant to the elementary science curriculum. The selected pre-inquiries were used for each class and its activity (question -resolution class) to accomplish the class goal. Through this research class, this study conducted T-test, mean-difference test, in order to compare the difference by period and group in science process skills and science-related affective domain. In the result of the science process skills, the controlled group showed 16.20 score while the experiment group showed 17.70 so that the experiment group showed higher score and it was a significant difference(p<0.05). Also, for the science-related affective domain, the experiment group showed significantly higher scores compared to the controlled group in general (p<0.001). This study explored the educational implication in organizing elementary science curriculums in consideration of the demanders such as what subject students have interest in or feel curious about.","Kang, Houn Tae and Noh, Suk Goo",0,,708
968,Scientific Discovery for All,"The scientific discovery process comes alive for 70 minority students each year at Uniondale High School in New York where students have won top awards for ""in-house"" projects. Uniondale High School is in a middle-income school district where over 95% of students are from minority groups. Founded in 2000, the Uniondale High School Research Program has grown to 70 students per year who are engaged in multiyear research projects developed using their own creativity and ingenuity. Students develop projects from an original idea that interests them, design the methodology, implement it, present results in written and oral form at competitions and conferences, and propose and conduct further studies. The Uniondale High School Research Program is successful because of careful ""recruitment,"" ""research projects"" that are devised by students, and ""recognition"" by the school, community, and outside entities. Student curiosity in, enthusiasm for, and commitment to the process of scientific discovery is paramount in the selection process. These qualities are a prerequisite for development of novel student-created research projects. All Uniondale students present their environmental science projects at the Dowling College Annual Symposium On the South Shore Estuary. Students benefit directly by winning monetary awards and other prizes at competitions, gaining admission to top colleges, earning college scholarships, and presenting their work at national scientific meetings. They gain confidence in themselves and discover their potential as their work is recognized by professionals. Although the most important key to success is a dedicated teacher (preferably a full-time program advisor), any teacher can replicate this program by guiding students in developing projects that use standard materials and equipment available in the school.

969,Assessing the Factors Deemed to Support Individual Student Intrinsic Motivation in Technology Supported Online and Face-to-Face Discussions,"Research has established that intrinsic motivation has a positive effect on learning and academic achievement. In order to investigate the phenomenon of intrinsic motivation in technology-supported learning environments, this paper investigates the factors deemed to support individual student intrinsic motivation in online discussions. A research model is presented based on research into motivation, and the specific areas of self-determination and curiosity provide a framework for the model. Mean scores for both online discussions and face-to-face discussions were compared using a two-tailed t-test for the six constructs of perceived competence, perceived challenge, feedback, perceived choice, perceived interest, and perceived curiosity. Results from the study showed that online discussions provided significantly stronger mean ratings (t = 3.2) for perceived choice than did face-to face-discussions, while online discussions gave somewhat significantly stronger mean scores for perceived competence (t = 1.84) than similar face-to-face discussions. Feedback obtained identical mean scores for both online and face-to-face discussions, as did perceived interest, while the slightly higher differences in the online situation were not significant for perceived challenge (t = 0.96) or perceived curiosity (t = 1.19). Assessing the factors deemed to support individual student intrinsic motivation may assist in enhancing intrinsically motivated behavior in technology-supported learning environments. This would assist Web course designers and science educators to create online learning programs that best utilize students' capacity for learning and academic performance. The Web, with no direct verbal face-to-face interaction, lends itself better to online discussion in a more structured manner by enabling students to communicate more comfortably with their peers and provides a more egalitarian environment, where participants share the same tools and opportunities to communicate. The creation of online learning programs provides students significant opportunities for learning, such as the extended exchange of ideas and expertise where students can read, respond to, or initiate comments in a virtual meeting space.

973,"Differences between Online and Traditional Students: A Study of Motivational Orientation, Self-Efficacy, and Attitudes","The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the differences in demographic characteristics, motivational orientation, self-efficacy, and attitudes about technology between students who enrolled in a course offered in the traditional setting and those enrolled in the same course online. The two groups, each comprised of 27 students, were administered self-report measures to evaluate their levels of technological self-efficacy, attitude toward technology, and motivational orientation. Participants also reported their age, number of online courses taken, and gender. Results indicated that the two groups did not differ in terms of their attitudes about and feelings of self-efficacy toward technology. Despite many similarities in motivational orientation, online students did report higher levels of interest, curiosity, and intrinsic motivation, suggesting that students in online courses may prefer autonomy in the course design. Further research is necessary to determine whether students seek out online courses because they possess motivation or if online courses create motivation.

974,"""Can We Do That Again?"" Engaging Learners and Developing beyond the ""Wow"" Factor in Science","Adding Mentos to an open bottle of Diet Coke can produce a fountain of liquid and froth extending several metres high. This activity can engage a wide audience of learners in a relevant and meaningful way, provide a model for creative science teaching, and help to develop learners' attitudes towards school science as a subject. In this paper, the authors describe the use of this activity with primary-aged learners. Some challenges associated with the construction of the delivery mechanism for the Mentos are discussed, and ideas are provided for improving the performance of the fountain. An activity that provides an unexpected or startling outcome is usually guaranteed to generate interest, excitement, and enthusiasm from learners of any age. Teachers often look to activities that not only inspire learners but also develop curiosity. The Mentos and Diet Coke activity is one such activity that has been made much more accessible to a wider audience through the Mythbusters television programme (Savage & Hyneman, 2006) and the science educator Steve Spangler (Steve Spangler Science, 2010a). Fritz Grobe and Stephen Voltz, the creators of EepyBird, have taken the Mentos and Diet Coke activity and developed new and unusual ways of presenting the activity through performance art, and their 2006 video, ""The Extreme Diet Coke & Mentos Experiments"" (EepyBird.com, n.d.), has been watched by millions. The popularity of the Mentos and Diet Coke activity has led to thousands of creative home videos being uploaded onto YouTube. The Mentos and Diet Coke activity has been successfully used by teachers to demonstrate science processes involved in completing an open-ended physics experiment with undergraduate physics students (Coffey, 2008b). The primary goal was to engage the physics students in ""real"" research. The students worked collaboratively to explore the different aspects of the activity, including the type of sweets used, temperature of the soda, and ingredients in the sweets and soda. The results from the work of these undergraduates were then published in Coffey (2008a). The interest in the Mentos and Coke activity resulted in the students' findings being reported in the popular science magazine ""New Scientist"" (Muir, 2008). This activity has also been used within undergraduate Chemistry courses to create curiosity and engagement with an authentic science focus (Baur, Baur, & Franz, 2006; De Grys, 2007; Eichler, Patrick, Harmon, & Coonce, 2007; Liljeholm, 2009; McGuyer, Broen, & Dang, 2009) and also as a model for volcanology investigations (Quane, Klos, & Jacobsen, 2009; Wright, Rust, & Cashman, 2006).

978,The Struggle for Creativity: The Effect of Systems on Principal Creativity a Systems Theory Perspective,"Creativity is generating more interest as we move into the 21 st century. Businesses are pressuring schools to graduate individuals who are critical thinkers and who can become future innovators. Principal creativity as a component of school success is virtually ignored. Numerous creativity studies examine the traits of personality, intelligence, motivation, or environment as predictors of creative job performance. Less attention is devoted to understanding the interactive role these components have on an individual's creativity. The research examining principal creativity is even more restrictive in scope to nonexistent. Using Csikszentmihalyi's (1996) three-pronged systems theory of creativity, this basic interpretive qualitative study employs open-ended interview questions and two Runco Creativity Assessment Battery (rCAB , 2011) assessments to explore how principals perceive the influence of systems on their ability to be creative. Framed within a constructionist viewpoint, narrative analysis investigates the gap that current literature has not addressed by attempting to answer the overarching question: How does the principal perceive the impact of systems on his or her ability to be creative? Through the data analysis several major themes emerged. As children, the principals were exposed to varied experiences and diverse ways of thinking. Engaging in activities that encouraged curiosity and perseverance appears to have laid the foundation for a lifestyle that continues into adulthood. As adults, they are able to identify and evaluate the worth of creative ideas. The principals not only excelled in their degreed fields of study, but also showed interest in exploring diverse subjects. They are ambitious, confident, competent, and eager to develop their own potential and that of their followers. The principals believe good communication builds honest and collegial relationships. They show a sensitivity and obligation to create the supportive environment needed to make their schools centers of creative thought and action. The interactive nature of systems theory becomes clear after analyzing the data. Their individual traits impact the relationships they have with the field, which impacts the domain of educational leadership. Using systems theory, this research adds to the literature and our understanding of principal creativity. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Griese, Vivian Elane",0,,715

This massive volume is organized into two parts, Part one providing an introduction to the topic and exploring the role of developmental components and temperament in personality disorders in childhood and adolescence. Part two deals with discrete disorders, begins with Asperger's disorder, followed by Borderline Personality Disorder, Narcissism, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Histrionic Personality Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, Dependent Personality Disorder, and Negative Personality Disorder. The book concludes with a summary chapter by the Editors reviewing what we now know regarding this field. This is a voluminous text, exploratory in many ways and organizing groundbreaking ideas, theories, and processes. It is written for those with interest and curiosity in this field. It could be a valuable graduate text for any psychology or psychiatry course addressing childhood personality disorders. Its strengths revolve around the select group of researchers and theorists who were asked to participate, in its concise style, and in its large, easy to read print. Its weaknesses are attributable to the very nature of the topic, given that little empirical data, as yet, exist. For those clinician's with a keen interest in this area, the $100 cost might not be a major obstacle.

In light of the approaching aged society, Taiwan's Ministry of Education enacted its ""Toward an Aged Society: Policies on Education for Older People"" program in the hopes that older people will be better able to adapt to the coming changes in society through continued learning. This study explored older adults' motivations for and the benefits of participating in cooperative learning groups. Qualitative focus group discussions were held with 13 cooperative learning groups and a total of 93 older adults. The results indicated that the motivations behind participating in cooperative learning groups included curiosity, the desire to promote senior citizens learning camps, the desire to learn exercises, personal interests, the desire to leave the house, the desire to combat physical and mental deterioration, and recommendations from others. They benefited from the learning process. The benefits from cooperative learning included demonstrating learning outcomes, happiness, new knowledge, improved physical health, altered outlooks on life, enhanced learning ability, and slowing the aging process. The results showed that older adults received positive feedback which enhanced and helped them to plan their lives.

987,"Freedom of mind in willing; or, Every being that wills a creative first cause","Physical science and material progress are now the absorbing objects of effort. To these all utility is ascribed, to the exclusion of the metaphysical, which lies under the imputation of being both uninteresting and useless. Why this opprobrium and whence the general neglect, the absolute indisposition, to inquire into the structure and conditions of our spiritual being, which, as the source of all our power and all our enjoyments, one might naturally suppose would most interest us, and at the same time, by its mystery, most excite our curiosity? That the discoveries in physics, so varied and so magnificent, have largely contributed to our material comforts, have feasted the intellect and even regaled the imagination, is undoubtedly one cause of this neglect of the science of mind. But there are other reasons, among which we may mention the real difficulties of the subject. These are of two distinct kinds; first, those of ascertaining the truths; and second, those of imparting them after they have been ascertained. The first of these are, in some respects, peculiar. We want to examine that which examines; we want the mind to be employed in observing its own action, i.e., we want it to be doing one thing when it is of necessity doing another. A further difficulty, even in the investigation of the phenomena of mind, arises from the fact that the language applied to metaphysical science is very imperfect as an instrument of thought. The science of mind has very little language of its own, and in adopting for it what has been formed and fitted to another department of knowledge, much confusion and error result. The ambiguity, or various meanings of the terms, so often mislead the investigator himself, that he is not infrequently obliged to relinquish the instrumental aid of words, and directly examine his original ideas and conceptions of the subjects of inquiry. The difficulty of imparting the results in a language so imperfect is obvious, and is increased when it has been discarded in reaching them. But, with all this in appreciation of its benefits and all its recognized difficulties, metaphysics has its peculiar attractions. The questions of every child, the yearnings of the adult, though in expression only occasionally gleaming through the settled gloom of discouragement and despondency, still manifest the fervid curiosity in regard to that mysterious invisible, which knows, thinks, feels and acts; and even in those too busy, too sluggish, or too hopeless to put forth an effort to gratify it. The reason of its being neglected lies not so much in its want of attraction, as in the prevailing idea of its inutility; and this idea, though now magnified by temporary causes, has a foundation in the fact, that no investigation of the nature of our faculties and powers, mental or physical, is essential to that use of them which our early existence demands. For this we have the requisite knowledge by intuition. We can use our powers without studying either anatomy or metaphysics. It is not, then, surprising that we should early direct our attention to the study of those extrinsic substances and phenomena of which more knowledge is obviously and immediately useful. The want of satisfactory results has also had its influence; and perhaps there is no question, the discussion of which has tended more to bring upon metaphysics the reproach of being unfruitful, than that of the ""Freedom of the Will."" The importance of removing this grand obstruction to the progress of ethics and theology, is appreciated only by those who in their researches have encountered it. They alone have caught glimpses of the radiant fields of speculation which lie beyond; and most men regard the speculations upon it, not only as having furnished no new truth, but as having obscured what was before known.

988,Riding an Emotional Roller-Coaster: A Multimodal Study of Young Child's Math Problem Solving Activities,"Solving challenging math problems often invites a child to ride an ""emotional roller-coaster"" and experience a complex mixture of emotions including confusion, frustration, joy, and surprise. Early exposure to this type of ""hard fun"" may stimulate child's interest and curiosity of mathematics and nurture life long skills such as resilience and perseverance. However, without optimal support, it may also turn off child prematurely due to unresolved frustration. An ideal teacher is able to pick up child's subtle emotional signals in real time and respond optimally to offer cognitive and emotional support. In order to design an intelligent tutor specifically designed for this purpose, it is necessary to understand at fine-grained level the child's emotion experience and its interplay with the inter-personal communication dynamics between child and his/her teacher. In this study, we made such an attempt by analyzing a series of video recordings of problem solving sessions by a young student and his mom, the ideal teacher. We demonstrate a multimodal analysis framework to characterize several aspects of the child-mom interaction patterns within the emotional context at a granular level. We then build machine learning models to predict teacher's response using extracted multimodal features. In addition, we validate the performance of automatic detector of affect, intent-to-connect behavior, and voice activity, using annotated data, which provides evidence of the potential utility of the presented tools in scaling up analysis of this type to large number of subjects and in implementing tools to guide teachers towards optimal interactions in real time.

994,Pathways from parental stimulation of children's curiosity to high school science course accomplishments and science career interest and skill,"Curiosity is fundamental to scientific inquiry and pursuance. Parents are important in encouraging children's involvement in science. This longitudinal study examined pathways from parental stimulation of children's curiosity per se to their science acquisition (SA). A latent variable of SA was indicated by the inter-related variables of high school science course accomplishments, career interest, and skill. A conceptual model investigated parental stimulation of children's curiosity as related to SA via science intrinsic motivation and science achievement. The Fullerton Longitudinal Study provided data spanning school entry through high school (N = 118). Parental stimulation of curiosity at age 8 years comprised exposing children to new experiences, promoting curiosity, encouraging asking questions, and taking children to a museum. Intrinsic motivation was measured at ages 9, 10, and 13 years, and achievement at ages 9, 10, and 11 years. Structural equation modelling was used for analyses.

995,Undergraduate veterinary education at University College Dublin: A time of change,"The final-year Bachelor of Veterinary Medicine (MVB) class of 2005 were the first cohort of students to complete the new curriculum at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin (UCD). The new curriculum is a fundamental departure from the traditional curriculum that had served the veterinary profession in Ireland over many years. The change was not a precipitate action but the outcome of a prolonged and thorough examination of the realities of veterinary medicine, its science and its art, in the first decade of a new millennium. Over recent decades, rapid and fundamental changes have been witnessed in the economic, cultural, and ethical environment in which the veterinary profession operates, and these changes, coupled with the ``information explosion,'' dictated an examination of the educational paradigm. The new curriculum exposes the first-year class to veterinary information technology and problem-based learning (PBL). In the second year, students are instructed in clinical examination, history taking, and client communication skills, in addition to further exposure to PBL. The third and fourth years are now systems-based, with coordinated input from microbiologists, parasitologists, pathologists, and clinicians in teaching each body system. The first lecture-free final year in the 104-year history of veterinary education in Ireland consists of clinical rotations and a four-week elective pursued within the faculty or at other recognized institutions. Students must also complete a minimum of 24 weeks' extramural studies (EMS). Critically, the development and assessment of all courses in the new undergraduate degree program has been driven by carefully thought out learning outcomes. The new curriculum will provide graduates with the essential knowledge and skills required for entry into the veterinary profession. Society expects these qualities from veterinarians in the interests of the communities they serve during their professional careers. In addition, the curriculum should foster the ability to adapt to changing circumstances, instill the desire and ability to work in teams, and develop life skills. It is hoped that the academic innovations will arouse the intellectual curiosity and commitment to lifelong learning that future graduates will require if they are to retain the confidence of the society in which they work in the future.","Doherty, Michael L and Jones, Boyd R",0,10.3138/jvme.33.2.214,727
996,How to connect school mathematics with students' out-of-school knowledge,"In this paper we present an explorative study for which special cultural artifacts have been used, i.e. supermarket receipts, to try to construct with 9-year old pupils (fourth class of primary school) a new mathematical knowledge, i.e. the algorithm for multiplication of decimal numbers. Furthermore also estimation and approximation processes have been introduced, procedures that are not commonly used in ordinary teaching activity. In our study the receipts, through some modifications, have become more explicitly tools of mediation and integration between in and out-of school knowledge; so they can be utilized to create new mathematical goals, thus becoming real mathematizing tools and constituting a didactic interface between in and out-of-school mathematics. In agreement with ethnomathematical perspective we deem that it is a task for the teacher to know, in order to be able to profitably take account of the teaching, the life experienced by the pupil. Future mathematics teachers should be prepared a) to see mathematics incorporated into real world, b) to investigate mathematical ideas and practices of their pupils, and c) to look for ways to incorporate into the curriculum elements belonging to the sociocultural environment of the pupils, as a starting point for mathematical activities in the classroom. In this way the motivation, interest and curiosity of the pupils will be increased and the attitude towards mathematics of both pupils and teachers will be changed.","Bonotto, C",0,10.1007/BF02655698,728
998,Michael Balint's group approach: The Boston Balint Group,"Michael Balint was a physician/psychoanalyst who trained in Hungary and emigrated to England in 1939 when Nazi Germany began to dominate Europe. At the Tavistock Clinic, he and his wife met with social workers and physicians around ``case discussion seminars.'' With his strong interest in medicine and his curiosity about the patient-physician relationship, he initiated research/training groups with interested physicians, which ultimately led to publication of the now-classic The Doctor, His Patient, and the Illness, a rich text that has become a virtual staple of family practice residencies, along with ``Balint Groups'' for training. Balint refrained from considering his groups'' psychotherapy'' in order to minimize resistance of his physician-students. But because the groups lasted sometimes for years and explored transference and countertransference in patient-physician relationships, he acknowledged that the result was personal growth of the participants. His techniques are described and an example of a Balint Group (''Boston Group'') are presented here.","Lipsitt, D R",0,10.1023/A:1023028121072,729
999,Finding Creativity for Children,"This paper examines the nature of creativity and the nourishing of children's creativity. One definition of creativity focuses on two of its aspects, of novelty and usefulness. Other definitions that stress one or the other of these aspects are discussed. According to M. Rhoades (1961), the four components of creativity are: (1) people--their traits and characteristics; (2) the thinking process they use; (3) the products or outcomes they produce; and (4) the nature of the environment in which creativity occurs. Teachers who wish to foster creativity in children must discover the individual child's interests and talents and establish an environment that promotes the expression of the child's interests and talents. Teachers should develop a sensitivity to observing traits that indicate creativity. These traits include flexibility, originality, openness, risk-taking, curiosity, imagination, independence, and tolerance of ambiguity. Environmental barriers to creative expression include lack of freedom, inappropriate reward systems, and insufficient resources and time. Environmental stimulants to creative expression include freedom, sufficient resources and time, enthusiastic management, a nonthreatening and collaborative atmosphere, recognition and reward, and challenge. An appendix lists 12 suggestions for establishing an environment conducive to creativity. A 12-item reference list is provided. (BC)","Hill, Rebecca",0,,730
1000,An uneasy but powerful alliance: Faculty use of e-books,"After embracing patron-driven acquisitions (PDA) models for e-books and publishing two articles on PDA, librarians at a small university wanted to investigate faculty attitudes toward e-books. Usage statistics showed heavy use of e-book collections, but information on faculty usage was merely anecdotal. A short survey was developed and sent to all teaching faculty in all disciplines to help Stetson University's collection development librarians match print and ebook selections to faculty preferences more effectively, thus increasing usage of titles purchased. Additionally, the results indicated whether faculty training was needed in the use of e-books. Preliminary data from faculty indicated that interest in e-books ranged from enthusiastic to uninterested. The majority of respondents were in the middle of those two extremes, expressing hesitant curiosity about e-books provided by the library. Most were interested in learning to use ebooks, download them to mobile devices, and use them within learning management systems such as Blackboard. In the interest of promoting faculty collegiality, a strategic, personalized training program was developed to introduce faculty to features of library-provided e-books. This article presents the survey instrument, survey results, and summary of the faculty e-book training program. <c2><a9> Common Ground, Debbi Dinkins, Laura N.

1001,A Learner's Voyage: My Moon Exploration in 2009,"My childhood experience in school was fragmented from my out of school experience where I lived in rural China. School subject matters were reduced to bits and pieces. I excelled in this artificial symbolic world. Progressing from preschool to graduate school, I trained to teach in that world, and gained the opportunity to study at Harvard. My first course there was with Eleanor Duckworth. To put students in close contact with subject matter, and to listen to learners explain what they think, Duckworth's course creates space where learners develop direct relationship with subject matter. Throughout the semester, we record the moon as we observe it, share observations, and discuss questions. In contrast with my prior schooling, we learners are responsible for following our emerging curiosities. Narrating from my moon study in that course, I chronicle how I came to grasp what it means to learn through truly experiencing exploratory learning. Reentering my moon study in researching for this paper became a search for what previous years of my schooling had taken away from me: confidence and dignity as a learner.","Yang, Yan",0,,732
1002,Unpacking the popularity of a paper on feigning sexual pleasure: Consider both sexual politics and 21st-century profits,"Comments on an article by Emily J. Thomas et al. (see record 2017-07072-002). Suspicions about women's sexual purity continue to feature as the central expression of this mistrust in cultures with obvious gender inequality, where dowry demands, men's honor entitlements, and virginity tests provide the tableaux where mistrust is played out. However, in the global North, where popular discourse emphasizes women's sexual emancipation, sexual self-expression and gender equality, the mistrust moves to a more covert level. It fuels ongoing interest in ""women feigning sexual pleasure"" but you will rarely see any analysis of the sources of this interest. Every topic is fodder for the boundless sexual curiosity of the media. In its insatiable need for sexual material, especially with the dignified tone of scientific research, media look for content such as new sexual facts and theories. They look to you and me, the readers and contributors to this journal, to fill their pages and websites. We who write about and research sexuality are as much part of contemporary sexual commerce as the manufacturers of other sexuality products, at least in the eyes of the mass media, and it behooves us to grasp our situation and situatedness.

1003,Can pornography have a positive influence on female sexuality? influence of frequent pornography consumption on the sexual lives of women: A qualitative study,"Research into the influence of pornography (sexually explicit material) on the sexual life and satisfaction of women is largely concentrated on the negative consequences of such consumption. There is a notable lack of interest in the influence on female sexuality of frequent female consumption of pornography, particularly when it is positive. This paper deals with attitudes, motivation and patterns of pornography consumption among young women who frequently use pornography to satisfy their own sexual needs. It is based on qualitative research carried out by way of in-depth interviews with 16 women aged between 20 and 29, who were engaged in higher education or had already earned a degree. The results have shown that, apart from satisfying their own sexual needs, women are also motivated by curiosity and a desire to learn for the purpose of broadening their own sexual repertoire and their repertoire with a partner. Carried out on a specific sample, this study has shown that consumption of pornography can have a positive influence on those women whose motives for its consumption are related to exploration and enrichment of their own sexual experience.","Brajdi<c4><87> Vukovi<c4><87>, M and Do<c5><a1>en, K and Ghazzawi, L and Taroki<c4><87>, S",0,10.5613/rzs.43.2.2,734
1004,An Augmented-Reality-Based Concept Map to Support Mobile Learning for Science,"Computer hardware and mobile devices have developed rapidly in recent years, and augmented reality (AR) technology has been increasingly applied in mobile learning. Although instructional AR applications have yielded satisfactory results and prompted students' curiosity and interest, a number of problems remain. The crucial topic for AR applications is the lack of appropriate instructional scaffolds to help students organize the content to be learned. Moreover, a lack of appropriate instructional activities and scaffolds often results in student confusion and frustration. Therefore, we integrated AR with concept maps to form a concept-mapped AR (CMAR) scaffold. Subsequently, whether CMAR improves learning outcomes, motivation, and attitude in mobile learning activities was determined. An empirical study was conducted on 71 fifth-grade elementary students in Southern Taiwan. The students were divided into CMAR and AR system groups. The results showed that students in the CMAR group performed significantly better than those in the AR group. The student interview results also showed that the CMAR system helped students organize what they wanted to learn.","Chen, Chien-Hsu and Chou, Yin-Yu and Huang, Chun-Yen",0,10.1007/s40299-016-0284-3,735
1005,AN INNOVATIVE TEACHING APPROACH TO CIRCULATORY AND SKELETAL SYSTEMS,"Today teaching Biology in school is still mainly tied to the transmissive method based on behaviorist theories. Consequently, the student is seen as a person who passively absorbs knowledge transmitted through textbooks, to be learned by heart. This makes the subject extremely tedious and tricky to students. It becomes necessary for school to take on a new challenge: to stimulate children with passion, interest, curiosity about the world of science and to strengthen their critical approach to scientific issues. As claimed by authoritative exponents of teaching Biology, this will be possible through a change of methods and teaching practices in the didactic management. Teaching Sciences, and in particular Biology, must be characterized by an active teaching in which students can learn by doing, actively involved in their learning and knowledge building. These considerations resulted in the present teaching research, aimed at testing two experimental hypotheses. The first concerned the validity and effectiveness of a workshop approach (of direct exploration) in the teaching of Biology and, specifically, in the teaching-learning processes of the circulatory and skeletal systems of vertebrates. The second experimental hypothesis concerned, the opportunity to deal with these physiological systems even in a comparative anatomy perspective. The research was conducted in two Primary Schools in the north-east of Italy. In the experimental classes, the circulatory and skeletal systems have been studied comparing heart and bones from different species of animal (such as chicken, dog, pig, rabbit, roe deer, striped dolphin and trout). The project included supplementary activities, differenced for the two systems, stimulating discussions and reflections about certain diseases of the skeletal system and exploring the circulatory system in a physiological perspective. The results highlighted the possibility of proposing, even in the Primary School, laboratory activities in Biology and the possibility to approach the students with complex subjects, like Comparative Physiology and Anatomy. Furthermore, these disciplines helped students to mature a more complete and qualitatively better knowledge about the circulatory and skeletal systems. Moreover, from the analysis of the self-evaluations, it emerged that almost the totality of children appreciated the laboratory activities.","Favaron, Anna and Ancona, Elisabetta and Bramuzzo, Simone and Callegaro, Erica and Guidolin, Laura and Irato, Paola and Santovito, Gianfranco",0,,736

Mass magazines, a popular source of health information among women and minorities, are well positioned to reach these targeted audiences and assist health communicators achieve their communication objectives. However, results from this pilot study suggest these vehicles are largely untapped channels to disseminate this type of culturally targeted health information. Content analyses of consumer mass magazines reveal Essence, an ethnic magazine, does incorporate some spiritual and religious factors; however, general readership magazines do not. Given the current spiritual landscape, health communicators can utilize not only ethnic magazines but also other women's mass magazines as health promotion channels to communicate health risk among African American women. <c2><a9> 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Lumpkins, C Y and Cameron, G T and Frisby, C M",0,10.1080/15348423.2012.688664,737
1007,Current factors affecting the choice of psychiatry as a specialty: An Italian study,"Objective: This study examined the differential impact of factors hypothesized to affect the choice of psychiatry as a specialty in Italy. Method: A 38-item Likert-type questionnaire about factors that potentially affect the choice of a career in psychiatry was administered to 97 Italian medical school graduates sitting for an admission examination to psychiatric residencies and to 82 colleagues sitting for an admission examination to an internal medicine residency. The two groups' ratings on the questionnaire items were compared. Results: Response rates were 49.5% and 45.1%, respectively, for the psychiatry and the internal medicine groups. Future psychiatrists did not differ from future internists in sociodemographic characteristics. They rated 13 factors on the questionnaire more positively than did their colleagues who were pursuing internal medicine, and many had chosen psychiatry very early (40% had done so before medical school). Some of the more positively rated factors were experience with mental illness either personally or by a relative or close friend, efficacy of psychiatric treatments, the degree to which psychiatric practice is perceived to be evidence based, research opportunities, and curiosity about the topic of ``madness.'' Conclusions: Findings confirm earlier work in North American samples showing a substantial cross-cultural consistency in motives for choosing psychiatry as a discipline. A strong, early interest and curiosity among these students, often present in the premedical and pre-clerkship years, suggests some benefit in targeting this group for recruitment.","Galeazzi, G M and Secchi, C and Curci, P",0,10.1176/appi.ap.27.2.74,738
1008,INVESTIGATIONS AND INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING IN THE CURRICULUMS OF,"In this paper we examine the preschool curriculums of different countries and we try to find if they can be characterized as emergents, if they focus on the project approach, if they involve extended investigations in different domains, if they emphasize on inquiry-based learning. Kindergarten curriculums can capitalize on children's natural curiosity and their desire to make sense of their environment. However, curiosity on its own is not enough. The guidance of the preschool teacher is essential to enable children to learn through inquiry. Many different skills make up inquiry-based learning for children, and children need many opportunities to develop and use these skills as they progress through the Kindergarten years. Inquiry skills should not be taught in isolation, but integrated into interesting topics and ideas. Taking into consideration the strengths, needs, and interests of the children in the class, the teacher should model the inquiry process and pose questions that encourage, support and extend the children's learning. The results of research showed that different curriculums indicate common elements but also points of divergence.","Michalopoulou, Aikaterini",0,,739

Career adaptability includes four specific dimensions: concern, control, curiosity, and confidence. Career counselors can use these four dimensions dynamically within the counseling process to help clients better adapt their needs and capacities to different constraints imposed by the work environment (Savickas et al., Journal of Vocational Behavior, 75:239<e2><80><94>250, 2009).

The use of a vocational battery that includes personality, interest, intelligence or aptitude, and values instruments in career counseling may help clients to identify their strengths and weaknesses, their emotional skill level, and increase their self-knowledge and career decision-making abilities (Rossier, International Journal for Educational and Vocational Guidance, 5:175<e2><80><94>188, 2005) in order to use this knowledge and these skills more appropriately and effectively in the future. Sharing results from clients<e2><80><99> personality, interests, and values inventories with them and showing them how their individual profiles have helped and hindered their career performance in the past helps them to build further strengths.

1010,Principles of the civil code,"This section begins with an introduction of topics to be covered in ""Principles of the Civil Code."" Of all the branches of legislation, civil law is that which has the least attraction for those who do not study jurisprudence as a profession. But this is not saying enough. In fact, it inspires a kind of terror. Curiosity has for a long time been ardently exercised upon political economy, upon penal law, and upon the principles of government. Celebrated works have given credit to those studies; and under the penalty of confessing a humbling inferiority, it is necessary to have some information, and to express some opinions about them. But civil law has not yet come out of the narrow enclosure of the bar. Its commentators sleep in the dust of libraries, by the side of its controversialists. The public knows not even the names of its sects; and regards with a mute and ignorant respect those numerous folios, those enormous compilations. The general repugnance against this study results from the manner in which it has been treated. The works above alluded to bear the same relation to the science of law which was borne to the natural sciences by the works of the scholastic writers, before the introduction of experimental philosophy. What is it of which this part of the law treats? It treats of everything that is most interesting to men: of their security; of their property; of their mutual and daily transactions; of their domestic condition, in the relations of father, of children, of husband, and of wife. Here it is that rights and obligations spring up; for all the objects of law may be reduced, without mystery, to these two terms. The civil law is, in fact, only another aspect of the penal law; one cannot be understood without the other. The disputes of jurisprudence have produced, among the lawyers, a kind of unbelievers, who have doubted whether law has any principles. According to them, everything is arbitrary. The law is good because it is the law; because a decision, of whatever kind, produces the great advantage of peace. There is a little truth in this opinion, and a great deal of error. It will be seen in the following chapters that the principle of utility extends to this part of the law, as to all others. But its application is difficult; it demands an intimate knowledge of human nature. Bentham made frequent digressions upon the laws of England, which I have suppressed, for they have only a local interest. There are cases, however, where his observations would have lacked a foundation if I had omitted to mention the particular laws which were their object. In seeking to be more clear, to develop that which in the original was often only an allusion, I may have made some mistakes, which it would be unjust to impute to the author. These laws are so difficult to understand, that it is dangerous for an Englishman who is not a lawyer to run the risk of speaking about them--a risk which, for obvious reasons, must be still greater in the case of a foreigner.

1013,Animal Cruelty among Children in Violent Households: Children's Explanations of their Behavior,"Despite increased recognition that childhood animal cruelty (CAC) is a risk factor for subsequent interpersonal violence, there is a dearth of research examining motivations for children's animal cruelty behaviors in the context of violent households. The purpose of this study is to build on prior research in this area using a qualitative child-centered design to explore themes in children's narratives about harming animals. We were specifically interested in learning: (1) what contextual or situational factors are related to CAC behaviors in the context of adverse family settings? (2) what do children's accounts of their behaviors reveal about their beliefs about animal minds?, and (3) what are motivations for children's perpetration of harm against animals? Forty-six children and their maternal caregivers were recruited from community-based domestic violence services. Children were asked to describe times when they had harmed animals; caregivers were interviewed separately about children's harm to pets, and these data were used to triangulate patterns in the child data. Data were analyzed in Atlas.ti using the qualitative coding process of template analysis. Our thematic findings included: history of witnessing animal cruelty; history of witnessing pet neglect/abandonment; CAC with family members; minimization of animal harm; anthropomorphic beliefs about animal sentience; punishing pets out of anger; and curiosity. Our findings demonstrate that asking about children's experiences with animals is an important part of the evaluation process for professionals who encounter children exposed to, or at risk for, experiencing family violence. Implications for research and intervention efforts are discussed.","McDonald, Shelby Elaine and Cody, Anna M and Booth, Laura J and Peers, Jennifer R and Luce, Claire O'Connor and Williams, James Herbert and Ascione, Frank R",0,10.1007/s10896-018-9970-7,743
1020,"EUDOR-A multi-centre research program: A naturalistic, European Multi-centre Clinical study of EDOR Test in adult patients with primary depression","Background: Electrodermal reactivity has been successfully used as indicator of interest, curiosity as well as depressive states. The measured reactivity depends on the quantity of sweat secreted by those eccrine sweat glands that are located in the hypodermis of palmar and plantar regions. Electrodermal hyporeactive individuals are those who show an unusual rapid habituation to identical non-significant stimuli. Previous findings suggested that electrodermal hyporeactivity has a high sensitivity and a high specificity for suicide. The aims of the present study are to test the effectiveness and the usefulness of the EDOR (ElectroDermal Orienting Reactivity) Test as a support in the suicide risk assessment of depressed patients and to assess the predictive value of electrodermal hyporeactivity, measured through the EDOR Test, for suicide and suicide attempt in adult patients with a primary diagnosis of depression. Methods and design: 1573 patients with a primary diagnosis of depression, whether currently depressed or in remission, have been recruited at 15 centres in 9 different European countries. Depressive symptomatology was evaluated through the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale. Previous suicide attempts were registered and the suicide intent of the worst attempt was rated according to the first eight items of the Beck Suicide Intent Scale. The suicide risk was also assessed according to rules and traditions at the centre. The EDOR Test was finally performed. During the EDOR Test, two fingers are put on gold electrodes and direct current of 0.5 V is passed through the epidermis of the fingers according to standards. A moderately strong tone is presented through headphones now and then during the test. The electrodermal responses to the stimuli represent an increase in the conductance due to the increased number of filled sweat ducts that act as conductors through the electrically highly resistant epidermis. Each patient is followed up for one year in order to assess the occurrence of intentional self-harm. Discussion: Based on previous studies, expected results would be that patients realizing a suicide attempt with a strong intent or committing suicide should be electrodermally hyporeactive in most cases and non-hyporeactive patients should show only few indications of death intent or suicides.

1027,University Curricula in the Global Marketplace: Bridging the Valley between,"This article argues that the traditional idealist-realist divide on educational thinking have been and shall continue to be regarded as ""normal"" so long as education is a continuum which derives its being from the disparity in human thought. To commute one to the other--specifically, idealist to realist--to meet desperate industrial needs would be tantamount to obliterating the dual view of reality, and reducing man to a straight-jacketed robot, alienating him from his essences; it would deny the very purpose of university education itself; which is to promote human curiosity and inquisitiveness that animate civilization and development. However, dialectically speaking, a synthesis of the idealism-realism divide exists in pragmatism from which derive compatibilism to harken to the call of industrial society for relevance of theoretical knowledge offered by the universities. This third perspective arising from the synthesis of the contending schools should illuminate the role of polytechnics and other professional and technical colleges, which engage in vocational studies that ought to serve the purpose of mediating the interest of the global marketplace. If the course offerings of the professional/vocational and technical institutions are still inadequate to serve industrial needs, compelling industry to maintain an eye on the university service in that direction, then workplaces ""must"" imbibe complementary in-service training programmes for the re-orientation of their inductees and existing work force on their core values, strategies and objectives, even as universities remain largely obligated to concentrate on their generic curricula. The article conducts an overview of the broad concern of tertiary academic institution, with a view to specifying that of the university; the two broad schools of education--idealism and realism--to clarify their features, relying more on LeoNora Cohen's (1999) work on philosophy of education. It further makes a case for their perennial division and suggests the relevance of polytechnics, work-study programmes as well as in-service training, to bridge the gap created by the perennial divide; and hopefully, serve the needs of industry.","Unah, Jim I",0,,749
1028,Factors influencing the career choices of physicians trained at Yale New Haven Hospital from 1929 through 1994,"Purpose. To examine factors that influenced, positively or negatively, the specialty career choices of physicians trained at Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH) from 1929 to 1994. Method. The authors sent questionnaires to 4,888 physicians who had trained or were training in YNHH-sponsored residency programs. The physicians rated 36 factors posited to be influenced in career choice on a seven-point Likert scale from very negative to very positive. The authors compared the means of each factor's ratings by decade of medical school graduation. Results. The most positively rated influences were similar in each decade from the 1920s to the 1990s. These influences shared characteristics of intellectual curiosity (''intellectual content of the specialty'' and ``challenging diagnostic problems''), altruism (''interest in helping people'' and ``opportunity to make differences in people's lives''), and personal identity (''consistent with personality'' and ``possess the required skill or ability''). Negative factors, such as ``demands on time and effort,'' ``stress in the fieid,'' and ``malpractice costs,'' were also consistently rated throughout the decades. Conclusion. The reasons that physicians choose certain specialty careers have not changed significantly over the past 65 years despite all the changes that have occurred in medicine. Physicians continue to seek professional opportunities that are viewed as intellectually challenging and of benefit to others.","Krol, D and Morris, V and Betz, J and Cadman, E",0,10.1097/00001888-199803000-00020,750
1029,Visual experience and blindsight,"Philosophers and psychologists share a taste for the bizarre. Philo- sophers have been known to speculate about brain transplants, the destruction and reconstruction of a human being and even the existence of a twin earth, complete with the twin of every living creature on the planet we inhabit. By comparison, the curiosities one can encounter in psychological textbooks and journals seem small fry. Nevertheless, there is an analogy between the purposes served by philosophical and psychological studies of this sort, for in both cases the oddity is supposed to show something about the norm, whether this is the normal behaviour of a concept or the normal functioning of whatever processes underlie our possession and exercise of psychological capacities. This chapter will examine a psychological phenomenon which is sufficiently strange to have proved of interest both to psychologists and to philosophers.

1031,When outsiders redefine the boundaries of comics,"In 2017, the yearly anthology Best American Comics published the works of five creators with mental disabilities. This unprecedented initiative demonstrates the continuously growing interest of the comics' world for art pieces commonly described as 'outsider'. Whether in Europe or in North America, this pattern is particularly obvious in the case of alternative creators and editors. In 1990, Henry Darger's huge compositions depicting an imaginary war between the little Vivian Girls and cruel men in uniforms were already reproduced in Francoise Mouly and Art Spiegelman's Raw. This magazine is often regarded as the inaugural act of the alternative comics movement. Alternative comics stand out for their desire not to adopt the standard forms of mainstream publications and to open up new fields of potentials. The reinvention of topics, stylistic approaches, storytelling schemes or relations between texts and images are coupled with a strong curiosity for other forms of graphic narratives. Moreover, there is a significant tendency to incorporate works associated with other artistic domains into the comics' field.

1034,SIMPLIFIED BIOSIGNAL PROCESSING BLOCKS FOR PROTOTYPING AND EDUCATIONAL,"The evolution of Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology has made exceedingly sophisticated sensors available to a larger audience. This provides an opportunity to find new applications to utilize these sensors, and not just in the medical field. The parallel advent of a Do-It-Yourself culture, especially concerning embedded systems and electronics has created an environment for rapid prototyping projects that require less technical skill allowing users to play with much more freedom. This has also opened new avenues in computer and electronics education. To ease this exploration for developers and students lacking advanced knowhow, there is a concerted effort to simplify the components. Noteworthy efforts on this front can be seen in the popularity of development kits such as those of Arduino and Little bits that uncomplicate the use of electronics and programming. We focused our interest on developing data processing modules using microcontroller systems (specifically the Arduino) for Bitalino Electromyography sensors to convert the raw signal into usable level data. In this study we detail the different techniques used to clean the signal and the cumulative effects of these techniques. The techniques being process intensive, are not recommended for critical applications but would suffice for applications in rapid prototyping, hobby projects and other non-critical operations. Furthermore, we touch upon how these techniques may be employed to translate other kinds of data inputs from both from biosensors and otherwise, and their relevance to fostering curiosity in electronics.","Romero, M E and Vangal, R",0,,753
1035,"Emotions, learning, and the brain: Exploring the educational implications of affective neuroscience","In this ground-breaking collection, Mary Helen Immordino-Yang-an affective neuro-scientist, human development psychologist, and former public school teacher-presents a decade of work with the potential to revolutionize educational theory and practice by deeply enriching our understanding of the complex connection between emotion and learning. With her signature talent for explaining and interpreting neuroscientific findings in practical, teacher-relevant terms, Immordino-Yang offers two simple but profound ideas: first, that emotions are such powerful motivators of learning because they activate brain mechanisms that originally evolved to manage our basic survival; and second, that meaningful thinking and learning are inherently emotional, because we only think deeply about things we care about. Together, these insights suggest that in order to motivate students for academic learning, produce deep understanding, and ensure the transfer of educational experiences into real-world skills and careers, educators must find ways to leverage the emotional aspects of learning. Immordino-Yang has both the gift for captivating readers with her research and the ability to connect this research to everyday learning and teaching. She examines true stories of learning success with relentless curiosity and an illuminating mixture of the scientific and the human. Two boys produce remarkable painted portraits after recovering from epilepsy surgeries that left each missing an entire hemisphere of his brain. An ethnically, linguistically and economically diverse class of Boston seventh-graders takes a new interest in studying science after learning about hominid evolution and natural selection for adaptive traits like skin color. A kindergartener writes a song comparing her family's love for her baby brother to the immensity of planet Earth. A group of adults participates in the first neuroimaging study of the experiences of admiration and compassion, revealing brain activities with radical implications for our understanding of consciousness, survival, self, and social learning. What are feelings, and how does the brain support them? What role do feelings play in the brain's learning process? This book unpacks these crucial questions and many more, including the neurobiological, developmental, and evolutionary origins of creativity, facts and myths about mirror neurons, and how the perspective of social and affective neuroscience can inform the design of learning technologies. Emotions, Learning, and the Brain is the educator's foray into the neurobiology of emotion. It is a game-changing book that will transform the way teachers think about learning.

1036,Laying Siege to Parabolic Understanding,"Getting and keeping the attention of an eight-grade algebra class can often be a challenge. Doing so while trying to meet curriculum expectations and standards can be a daunting task unless projects are designed to both pique and maintain student curiosity. Projects designed around standards that initiate interest and have multiple entry points for students of different ability levels are a teacher's best tool for building understanding. This article describes a project that allows students to become engaged right from the start as they take a hands-on approach exploring linear relationships, parabolic curves, and quadratic functions. Although there can be considerable preparation in time, it is worth the effort and can be used year after year with little additional preparation time. Once the teacher briefly introduces the operation and use of the manipulatives, students can take the lead in working through the project and building understanding. Information needed for the project--including background, set-up execution, and follow-up activities--is presented.

1038,Community Service Orders in Action,"This study developed out of a genuine interest and curiosity on the part of the writer as to what happens in those cases where a sentence involving probation with a condition of community service was appealed by either the offender or the crown prosecutor and, therefore, was taken before an Appellate Court of Canada. Research revealed 24 such cases. What the writer was looking for was the type of cases appealed, and the reasons given by the Appellate Courts for decisions given. At the same time, the writer was very conscious of the similarities and differences found in each individual case. Although researching these findings has been the major goal of this study and has involved the extensive use of a legal computer as welt as a manual search of related reports, it has been necessary, in order to understand these findings, to research other areas of the criminal justice system and the sentencing process. The case comments (24) found in this paper are directly related to the use of community service orders. The decisions handed down by the Appellate Courts of Canada in each case are interesting, and encouraging to anyone working in community service order programmes. It is the intent of the writer that by having these 24 cases which can be properly cited, the community service order co-ordinator will be able to encourage reluctant members of the Bench to use this alternative to incarceration.","Sweeney, Patricia C",0,,757

His interest in traumatology began with one of his first patients, a Vietnam War combat veteran who wanted to be free from his painful symptoms, later known as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The author's work integrates developmental, biological, psychodynamic, and interpersonal aspects of the impact of trauma and its treatment. Because of his multidisciplinary approach and personal curiosity he has, perhaps more than any other modern traumatologists, helped to stimulate creativity among practitioners.

Its purpose is threefold: to sketch an overview of the major theories and concepts; to expose issues, summarize arguments and counter-arguments; and to encourage the beginning student to pursue critical thinking in the recognition that mainstream ideas deserve scrutiny, many essential questions remain unsettled, and that the outcome may result in the formulation and reinforcement of a personal perspective, premised on one<e2><80><99>s individual learning.The principal chapters focus on important themes and dichotomies of theory with attention to institutional frameworks (state and system approaches), the social dimension (class and group formations), the cultural dimension (individual and collective preferences), the economic dimension (capitalist and socialist development), and the political dimension (representative and participatory democracy). <c2><a9> 2000 by Taylor & Francis.","Chilcote, R H",0,10.4324/9780429501500,759

1047,Unified Blended Family Business: A New Perspective for the 21st Century Understanding Relationships in Family Businesses,"Eighteen million family businesses operate in the United States. Within these businesses, family and non-family members create two distinct groups of stakeholders, which engender in-group and out-group issues. Relationships between these two groups of stakeholders have remained relatively invisible and unexamined. In addition, current literature indicates that long-held beliefs about families are changing. Yet, many family businesses appear bound to the traditional meanings ascribed to the construct family. Within a social constructionistic frame, two areas of curiosity guided this naturalistic qualitative research study: (a) interrelational aspects of family and non-family stakeholders and (b) meanings family and non-family stakeholders ascribe to the notion of family as a component of the family business. Thirty-five stakeholders from 11 family firms participated in this research study. Results indicated that entities of blended family businesses appeared practical, especially for family businesses that were beyond their first generation. Some family firms, in second-, third-, and forth-generation, believed that the survival of their firms may be dependent on a blend of family and nonfamily personnel, thus creating a blended family enterprise.","Nedlin, Marny B",0,,763

1050,Increased visual interest and affective responses to impossible figures in early infancy,"This research evaluated infants' facial expressions as they viewed pictures of possible and impossible objects on a TV screen. Previous studies in our lab demonstrated that four-month-old infants looked longer at the impossible figures and fixated to a greater extent within the problematic region of the impossible shape, suggesting they were sensitive to novel or unusual object geometry. Our work takes studies of looking time data a step further, determining if increased looking co-occurs with facial expressions associated with increased visual interest and curiosity, or even puzzlement and surprise. We predicted that infants would display more facial expressions consistent with either ``interest'' or ``surprise'' when viewing the impossible objects relative to possible ones, which would provide further evidence of increased perceptual processing due to incompatible spatial information. Our results showed that the impossible cubes evoked both longer looking times and more reactive expressions in the majority of infants. Specifically, the data revealed significantly greater frequency of raised eyebrows, widened eyes and returns to looking when viewing impossible figures with the most robust effects occurring after a period of habituation. The pattern of facial expressions were consistent with the ``interest'' family of facial expressions and appears to reflect infants' ability to perceive systematic differences between matched pairs of possible and impossible objects as well as recognize novel geometry found in impossible objects. Therefore, as young infants are beginning to register perceptual discrepancies in visual displays, their facial expressions may reflect heightened attention and increased information processing associated with identifying irreconcilable contours in line drawings of objects. This work further clarifies the ongoing formation and development of early mental representations of coherent 3D objects.","Krause, Christina and Longo, Danielle and Shuwairi, Sarah",0,10.1016/j.infbeh.2019.101341,765
1051,How Literature Achieves AEsthetic Objectivity,"In daily life we are largely preoccupied with Close-ups. Only infrequently in our workaday hours is there a clipping of practical interests which results in aesthetic detachment. Often the aesthetic attitude is initiated only to be rudely shattered. Perhaps catching a glimpse of a lovely young girl we find ourselves rapt away in contemplation of her loveliness when, deftly, she pulls out her mirror and a powder-puff. She has destroyed the illusion. Unless, perchance, she be dancing across a stage to music, in which case she may powder her nose in public--if she does it rhythmically and not too efficiently--and still remain an object of aesthetic interest, because so many of the threads of daily life were clipped with our ticket when we entered the theatre. A beautiful woman in life rarely creates purely aesthetic effects, even when distanced by all the devices of ceremonial or those of stage-craft. She too inevitably arouses in men the personal, the possessive attitude; in women that of curiosity and envy. Not even when her beauty is embodied in marble or reduced to a mystery of light and shadow is it sure to give an impersonal effect.

1052,Science-Relevant Curiosity Expression and Interest in Science: An Exploratory Study,"In efforts to understand and promote long-term interest in science, much work has focused on measuring students' interest in topics of science, typically with surveys. This approach has challenges, as interest in a topic may not necessarily indicate interest in scientific practices and pursuits. An underexplored and perhaps productive way to gauge and foster interest in science is to understand the ways in which students express curiosity about the nature of an object, phenomena, or a given topic. This study explores the nature and prevalence of students' expressions of science-relevant curiosity such as wonderment about causal mechanisms, teleological explanations, and inconsistencies in observations. We coded student photojournal entries and interview responses to explore (1) how wonderment can be characterized not by science topic or domain, but rather by the aspects of scientific inquiry practice they reflect, (2) the variation in such science-relevant curiosity expression in a small sample (N = 19) of sixth-grade students, and (3) how individual variation in curiosity expression relates to reported interest in science. We found that a qualitative approach using photojournaling and interviews captured a wide variation in curiosity expression among students, and brief cases analyses (N = 3) demonstrate that students with differing patterns of curiosity expression talk about their interest in science differently.","Luce, Megan R and Hsi, Sherry",0,10.1002/sce.21144,767
1054,EXPERIENCE IN THE USE OF MOODLE CHOICES FOR STUDENTS OF STATISTICS,"We present an experience carried out for students of Statistics with the help of Moodle virtual platform used in the Universidad Politecnica Madrid (UPM). It was performed with various groups in the subject of Extension of Mathematics, a part of the Arquitecto Tecnico degree, in using Choices that are adapted to the Moodle educational platform to which the university student can either respond intuitively or by using the statistical tools studied in the subject. After the student has responded to the Choice, the statistical methods required to solve the set question are explained. Students who have failed to select the right answer have an incentive to study the subject since they have been shown that by so doing they will be able to improve their decision-making. On the other hand, the Moodle platform system itself automatically processes the responses and offers a bar graph showing the group's overall result. Therefore, each student knows the percentage of students that have chosen each of the possible options. This encourages them to compare their own answer with that of their fellow-students, which motivates the student to improve. We have also analysed the relation between the responses to these Choices and the final marks obtained by the students of the subject. To do this, the students were divided into classes according to the number of correct responses to the Choices. The analysis of variance indicates that there is no difference between the prior classes of students. This leads us to think that the lack of probabilistic intuition initially shown by some students has been offset by their efforts in studying the subject matter. The conclusions can be extended to any subject of Probability or Statistics providing the students can answer the questions set by the teacher, either in some educational platform like Moodle or by the use of some other resource that allows the responses to be automatically processed. This procedure provides a motivation for students and arouses their interest in the subject being taught. This is particularly necessary in core subjects that do not contain the specific subject matter of the student's chosen degree. They see these subjects as being dry and far removed from their interests and expectations. Such is the case in this instance where the development of this experience has been shown to be effective in providing an incentive to students' curiosity and interest for study.","Angeles Gilsanz-Mayor, M and Casaravilla-Gil, Ana",0,,768

1056,"Curiosity, learning, and the dopaminergic circuit","Comments on an article States of curiosity modulate hippocampus-dependent learning via the dopaminergic circuit by M J. Gruber (2014). States of increased interest and curiosity are well known to improve learning and memory, but the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been fully elucidated. Now, in a study of healthy young paid volunteers, it has been found that a state of heightened curiosity improves memory for both information that they were curious about as well as incidental material presented at the same time. Memory was improved immediately after testing as well as 1 day later. The results disclosed that increased curiosity activated the nucleus accumbens and midbrain. In addition, individual differences in memory for incidental material was related to anticipatory fMRI activity in the midbrain and hippocampus and functional connectivity between these two regions. As extrinsic reward is known to increase activation and dopaminergic activity in the midbrain, and intrinsic curiosity also increases midbrain activity, this suggests that there is a common dopaminergic mechanism underlying both intrinsic curiosity and extrinsic reward. These results suggest that enhancing curiosity prior to acquisition of knowledge will enhance learning and that the further development and use of improved educational methods to enhance curiosity will provide considerable educational benefits.

1057,The psychology of achievement,"What are we doing to find and foster people of rare ability? This book is devoted chiefly to the consideration of the first of these problems, which might be called euthenic psychology. Achievement is described as distinguished successful endeavor, usually in the face of difficulties. Character is diagrammed by means of ""the circle of personality"" in which radii represent traits and distance from the center the degree of their strength. Fifty traits are represented; nine of them are basic traits of achievement. By the use of this circle characters, real and imaginary, are portrayed showing where they meet, exceed, or fall short of the requirements of their respective jobs. Most of the book is devoted to analysis of a few of the most potent traits of personality: (1) Energy, the sort which is inborn and cannot be acquired; without which achievement is virtually impossible; and which can sometimes by sheer drive compensate for mediocre ability. (2) Interest, or ""a purpose in life"" to concentrate free energy upon one goal. (3) Emotions which produce and sustain the attitude of ""aggressive superiority"" and which are strong enough to resist orthodox training in submission. (4) Intelligence, marked by curiosity, imagination, memory, even performance, ability to observe and analyze, and modest self-appraisal. However, the presence of these qualities does not guarantee great achievement. The individual possessing them must find himself and his work early in life, before the twentieth year, or there is little probability of outstanding accomplishment. If the possibilities of these potential leaders are to be realized they must be picked out at an early age and given special training, which could be done by establishing a ""university of leadership.""

1059,"Informal learning: Perspectives, challenges and opportunities","Human beings are learning all the time. Regardless of whether or not they are enrolled in formal education, people are constantly learning from everyday experiences through problems they have solved and interactions they have encountered. Humans learn from family, friends, peers and colleagues as well as through their own natural curiosity. This informal learning is a powerful part of the learning experience, and is important to lifelong learners of all ages. Informal learning is important to education, in the workplace, during leisure activities and in social situations. The impact of informal learning is therefore quite considerable. Formal learning in the classroom is well-documented and exhaustively researched, but is limited by the need for an expert to design and scaffold that learning space. Even non-formal (self-regulated or self-directed) learning involves a goal, or a specific aim, and is usually guided by a curriculum. In contrast, informal learning is generally lacking in a clearly defined aim, is rarely-if ever-assessed, and can occur in any environment, at any time, and by anyone. This book aims to highlight examples of the many different forms that informal learning can take, and to assess its impact on educational situations and on learning in the workplace. Drawn from educational and workplace settings from expert contributors across the globe, the studies in this volume cover a broad range of environments and disciplines. Presented is a collection of case studies, expert reviews and original research, which illustrate different forms of informal learning, and provide examples of how the potential for informal learning can be harnessed in practice. From the experiences of workplace learners, adult learners, virtual learning communities, older learners, clinicians and volunteers, this volume addresses the role of informal learning in a variety of working and learning environments. By addressing the development of skills, identities, learning approaches and professional relationships, an impression of the role of informal learning in educational development is also highlighted. Finally, via examples of ubiquitous learning using mobile technologies, revisions to curricula, the use of games in learning, and the use of <e2><80><9c>pop-up schools<e2><80><9d>, this volume highlights how informal learning can be embedded in learning activities that lead to profound changes in how people see the world. This book would be of interest to educators and managers alike, and aims to highlight that informal learning occurs all around us, and if we recognise it and its impact, then we can enhance our potential as lifelong learners and make work and educational environments richer and more effective. <c2><a9> 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

1061,It Don't Come Easy: Overcoming Obstacles to Technology Use Within a Resistant Consumer Group,"To identify ways in which resistance can be overcome and technology's potential realized, we study acceptance and use of a specific technology, the Internet, by a specific resistant group, older consumers. Using interviews and a survey of consumers who are over 65 years old, we discover that curiosity and proactive coping drive technology optimism, which then predicts adoption and heavier usage. Motivated seniors with technology discomfort get help to adopt and continued assistance to learn usage repertoires. Surprisingly, technology discomfort is positively rather than negatively related to usage enthusiasm. Implications are drawn for consumer groups resistant to technology. <c2><a9> 2012 by The American Council on Consumer Interests.","Gilly, M C and Celsi, M W and Schau, H J",0,10.1111/j.1745-6606.2011.01218.x,774
1062,Curiosity and willingness to become involved,"Asked 103 teachers' college students to select from a list of problem-solving situations the content areas, and within areas the level of complexity or ambiguity, in which they would be willing to participate as experimental Ss. When each S's interest area subscale scores on the Ontario Test of Intrinsic Motivation (OTIM) were ranked, volunteering at the medium and particularly the high, complex levels was more frequent in higher ranked interest areas. Correlations showed that the mechanical, computational, and musical subscales were positively related to the complexity level chosen in their respective experimental areas, and the mechanical and scientific subscales predicted the average level chosen. OTIM total scores were more related to the amount of volunteering than to the complexity level favored.

1063,Development of a parent's guide for the Singapore primary science curriculum: Empowering parents as facilitators of their children's science learning outside the formal classrooms,"Parents can play a vital and active role in facilitating their children's science learning outside the formal classrooms. Parental involvement in their children's science learning process not only could enhance their children's learning motivation and interest in science, it could also help to strengthen the family bond when parents and children learn together. This paper describes the development of a Primary Science Parent's Guide to complement and support the Singapore Primary Science Curriculum (from primary levels 3 to 6). The guide aims to empower the parents of Singapore primary school children as facilitators of their children's science learning to reinforce science concepts and develop their children's science process skills, creative thinking and curiosity outside the formal classrooms. In this paper, the author will provide a brief background to and the rationale for the development of the Parent's Guide. Theoretical perspectives underlying its development, implications and potential issues of parental involvement in their children's science learning process outside the formal science classrooms will also be discussed. <c2><a9> 2012 HKIEd APFSLT.","Lee, A N",0,,776
1066,Young Adult International Adoptees' Search for Birth Parents,"This study examines international adoptees and factors associated with searching for birth parents. A total of 1,417 international adoptees in The Netherlands, aged 24 to 30 years, were divided into 4 groups: uninterested nonsearchers, interested nonsearchers, searchers, and reunited searchers. In total, 32% of adoptees had searched. Although the majority of searchers were well-adjusted, they had more problems-mainly internalizing problems-than uninterested nonsearchers. These problems, however, were not caused by the search itself. It is concluded that searching is the product of natural curiosity influenced by external factors such as the divorce of adoptive parents and the options for searching.","Tieman, Wendy and van der Ende, Jan and Verhtulst, Frank C",0,10.1037/a0013172,777
1068,What if schools were lively more-than-human agencements all along? Troubling environmental education with moldschools,"The recent more-than-human turn has increased interest in writing about relations between humans and other animals. In addition, scholars have called for a need to complement the animal turn with a turn to microbes. Microbes entangle all life in relations and participate in processes of living and dying, but thus far, they have been largely absent in environmental education research. This article attempts to think with microbes in environmental education by zooming into the phenomenon of `moldschools' in Finland. Employing the concept of agencement, the article first explores how school buildings, toxic molds, and humans have effectuated each other and introduces the idea of indoor climate crisis. Then the article explores the complexity of everyday life in one moldschool, asking, how was the school becoming felt and practiced differently by children and teachers in relation to material-discursive mold. Finally, the article asks what moldschools might teach us or ask from us in terms of environmental education and ethics. The notion of schools as always already more-than-human agencements is offered to make space for hesitation and curiosity on various scales of connection.","Tammi, Tuure",0,10.1080/13504622.2019.1584881,778

1071,Musical Education and Egyptian Child's Psychological and Social Needs,"The role played by music in Egyptian education in developing the character of the child is discussed. The first part of the paper discusses the characteristics of the elementary school child and examines how each can be developed through musical education. For example, young children have a fertile imagination that can be stimulated by music. Other characteristics discussed are curiosity, the childhood tendency toward beauty, the potentiality of childhood, the child's readiness to respond to any emergent influence, and the child's sociability. Musical education can help the child develop muscular-motor cooperation, aural memory and time sensation, and the abilities to differentiate aurally and to observe and pay attention. The second part of the paper examines childhood needs and the role played by music to satisfy them. For example, children need to be loved and to be affectionately secure. Music stimulates pleasant emotions and can satisfy children's need for love by encouraging them to participate with others, as in a chorus. Other needs discussed are those of security, belonging and social acceptance, self-respect and self-esteem, success and accomplishment, and knowledge and understanding.

1072,THE EDUCATIONAL DISTRICT - AN EXPERIMENTATION OF JOYFUL AND DIFFUSED,"In our society the school is one of the most exclusive places to educate the new generations, so we put trust and many expectations on it. As institution, it has a particular organization of spaces, times, rules, roles and its practices are based on rigorous hierarchies, discipline and authority, training children and young people to become suitable for the society in which they live. School reflects the dominant educational culture and spreads ideas that even if unconsciously internalized, have an indepth action on students. Its spaces are often detached and devoid of beauty and sensibility; inside school everything is under control and quantified, making learning and knowledge influenced by the market laws of our society. It rather focuses the attention on profit and results than on every student's personal path and makes culture something to get close to in a bored attitude and without any interest and passion. That's why in these years Paolo Mottana, a professor of the University of Milan-Bicocca, elaborated a theoretical reflection called ``joyful and diffused education'' to think about education again and to create educational experiences out of the school as we know it; in this new way of thinking about education the entire society and not only the school is the best context in which children and young people can learn and live rich, deep and exciting experiences. The town becomes an important experience place, in which young people can be real actors and not only spectators of their learning activities and of the city life. But town has to change its spaces, times and rhythms to welcome young generations, to pay them attention, to take care of them and to set their vitality, creativity and competences off. Starting from the joyful and diffused education reflection, Paolo Mottana and his research group elaborated the ``Educational District'', an experimental project in collaboration with some lower secondary schools of a district in Milan. It wants to foster a more inductive way of learning, which starts from the students' curiosity and the experiences lived out of the school, building real and diversified ways of discovering, far from the simulations and simplified experiences lived in the traditional school system. It also wants to satisfy young people's need for independence and involvement, promoting their attitudes, making them co-planners and letting them play a main role in their schooling, which needs to be more individual and personalized. The school needs to become a more open and flexible place, a ``hole'', a base, a meeting point to go and come back to talk, discuss and rework the experiences lived in the town. In this way school could get closer to young people's life and create strong links with the territory, being not the only educational institution and recognizing the importance of sharing this responsibility, this task with the territory and the entire society, trying to make a real cultural revolution.","Barioglio, M and Mottana, P and Martino, F and Pedrazzini, E",0,,782
1073,Interest and Prior Knowledge,"This paper selectively reviews research on the relationship between topic interest and prior knowledge, and discusses the optimal association between these variables. The paper points out that interest has a facilitating impact on learning, and at least part of this effect must be ascribed to prior knowledge. While the interest-knowledge association may account for about 20 percent of the variance, 80 percent of the variance in the effects of interest may then be unaccounted for by prior knowledge, leaving a considerable portion of independent variance with which interest can affect learning. Research suggests that interest contributes to learning in the following ways: it seems to invoke deeper types of comprehension processes, leads to greater use of imagery, and may arouse a more personal and extensive network of relevant associations than are invoked by prior knowledge. Analysis of a model of interest-prior knowledge relationships suggests that categories of high interest and low knowledge, and low interest and high knowledge, are likely to be transitory. Suggestions are made to divide topic interest into specific and domain interests. The advantages of educational research on interest or curiosity are discussed.

1074,Capturing Mathematical Curiosity with Notice and Wonder,"Teachers put a great deal of energy into searching for ways to engage each and every student. Some of these efforts fail. Others look promising one day, only to become less effective as the novelty wears off. Teachers want their students to feel ownership of their learning. They also believes that students engage more when learning mathematics relates to their own interests and curiosities. Brighton (2007) validates their intuition, noting that young adolescents seek intellectual opportunities to explore the varied facets of their lives and are more eager to learn about topics they find personally relevant. In this article, the authors describe an instructional routine that teachers can use to capitalize on young adolescents' intense curiosity about the world. They give two classroom examples of the ""Notice and Wonder"" routine (Ray-Riek 2013), discuss classroom implementation, and describe how this routine helps to meet the needs of students.","Rumack, Aaron M and Huinker, DeAnn",0,,784

The article deals with two issues: How do teachers promote participation in a preschool classroom as compared with a primary school classroom? What similarities and differences are found? It also considers the question of how the similarities contribute to the continuity from preschool to primary school in terms of participation. Based on observation data insights are provided into the interactions between teachers and children by using extracts from teacher-led learning sessions. The teachers used a diversity of strategies to promote participation in both contexts. In the preschool the focus was on participation and interaction as such, whereas in the primary school the emphasis was more clearly on academic learning. The findings suggest that teacher support of active participation and friendly relationships, together with creative and playful activities in the preschool, enrich children's curiosity, and nourish children's motivation for and interests in academic learning. <c2><a9> 2010 TACTYC.","Hannikainen, Maritta and Rasku-Puttonen, Helena and H<c3><a4>nnik<c3><a4>inen, M and Rasku-Puttonen, Helena",0,10.1080/09575146.2010.485555,787

Part I introduces the science by way of definitions, classification of mental experiences and practical applications to a wide variety of subjects--from the psychological laboratory to psychic phenomena. Part II introduces the reader to the psychoanalyst, then hastily escorts him through the psychological laboratory where he becomes acquainted, necessarily rather superficially, with scientific problems and technique. In the reviewer's opinion, the value of the book might have been enhanced if the chapter on character analysis in Part III, a field where popular interest and curiosity center, and upon which the author is particularly qualified to write, had not been limited to seventeen pages.

1085,Organizational paradoxes: When opposites cease to be opposites,"I have been using Kelly's (1955) repertory grid technique (RGT) with managers in organizational settings for over a decade now. My curiosity has always been about how managers find meaning in the things they do in organizational life. This interest led me originally to investigate employee performance appraisal systems and later to branch away from the area of human resources into dealing with boards of directors in their everyday strategizing. These include such phenomena as how senior executives see, interpret, and make sense of their strategizing experiences, director cognitions of board work, effective directorship, and how critical business issues (strategic issues) are interpreted; and, more recently, the usefulness of the strategy tools and techniques we teach in business schools. As I engaged more with the method (RGT) finding new ways of thinking about it and applying it in managerial and organizational situations I began to find deeper appreciation of this powerful clinical approach through a wider understanding of my own scholarship in Kelly's theory of personal constructs. This became even more evident as I entered a whole new area of research that investigated organizational paradoxes. This chapter brings together the insights I have gained from looking at the intersection of this new and emerging body of management research and Kelly's psychology of personal constructs.

1091,Measuring Epistemic Curiosity in Young Children,"Epistemic curiosity (EC) is the desire to obtain new knowledge capable of either producing positive experiences of intellectual interest (I-type) or of reducing undesirable conditions of informational deprivation (D-type). Although researchers acknowledge that there are individual differences in young children's epistemic curiosity, there are no existing measures to assess the I-and D-type constructs of EC in early childhood. The aim of this study was to develop and validate parent-report scales that reliably assessed early expressions of I- and D-type EC in young children. To develop the I/D-Young Children (I/D-YC) scales, 16 potential items were administered to 316 parents of children aged 3 to 8. These items were adaptations of an existing adult self-report measure of EC as well as newly developed items. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that a 10-item 2-factor (5 I-type, 5 D-type) model had the best fit. Construct validity analyses and psychometric data indicated that our newly developed I/D-YC scales are valid and reliable measures of individual differences in early expressions of I-and D-type EC.

1092,A VoIP system for mobility voice security support using the VPN,"Voice over internet protocol (VoIP) provided voice service using Internet. It receives footlights when it escapes an initial curiosity. Interest to VoIP increased, because it can transfer existing phone service and deliver voice data through Internet technology. Communication service providers introduce Next Generation Network and Broadband convergence Network with VoIP as an added service to the consumer. In addition, session initiation protocol (SIP) service can be applied even outside the Internet phone service. However, it is needed to ensure secrecy of VoIP call in a special situation. It is relatively difficult to eavesdrop in the commonly used Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) as it is connected with 1:1 circuit. In this paper, we propose a new model of Internet telephone for eavesdrop prevention enabling VoIP (using SIP protocol) to use the virtual private network (VPN) protocol and establish the probability of practical use comparing it with Internet telephone.

Curiosity is often inopportune, often neither possible nor necessary. It is often inopportune, only on account of the circumstances in which we find ourselves; that, is however, no fault in disposition. But often it does show a fault, since it reveals evil desires. Yet the fault does not then lie always in the curiosity as such, but in the emotion, which has its seat in the older and now aroused presentations, and its root in the organism. Therefore we shall blame this, and not the curiosity itself.

1097,Vicarious traumatization and transformation in Holocaust interviewers: A qualitative investigation of the impact of indirect traumatic exposure,"This study was a systematic exploration of the experience of interviewing Holocaust survivors and the factors affecting the interview process and outcome. A qualitative methodology, grounded theory, provided the framework and tools for the study design, data collection, and analysis. Twelve participants, all interviewers of Holocaust survivors, were recruited from eight organizations where oral history narratives have been gathered. The participants were interviewed and their responses classified into three categories: (1) the interviewers' emotional reactions to the interviews; (2) the cognitive and behavioral actions they took to facilitate the process and outcome of the experience; and (3) the consequences of their actions. The participants' reactions, actions, and consequences were examined over three time periods (i.e., before, during, and after the interviews) and divided into more descriptive subcategories. The salient factors were also grouped into three categories, which pertained to the characteristics of the interviewers, the interviews, and the survivors. The categories were then divided into subcategories. The central theme integrating the categories was the participants' closeness/connection to or distance from the Holocaust, the survivors, and their testimonies. This theme provided a unifying explanation for the participants' interest in the interviews, the effort they applied toward achieving a good outcome, their ability to relate to the survivors and elicit the survivors' testimonies, the effects of the interviews, and the impact over time. Although several participants described negative effects (e.g., dissociation, hypervigilance, flashbacks) consistent with secondary traumatic stress reactions, none viewed the overall experience as traumatic. Rather, they considered it positive and meaningful. They derived a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from conducting the interviews. In doing so, they developed greater interpersonal connections; interviewing skills; confidence; curiosity; knowledge; understanding; tolerance; perspective; gratitude; hope; clarification of values, priorities, and career direction; Jewish identification; awareness of prejudice and violence; and social activism. The salutary outcomes outweighed the adverse consequences, thereby mitigating them. By illuminating the effects of indirect traumatic exposure and the process of adjustment and growth over time, the study's findings facilitate efforts to prevent adverse consequences while fostering positive outcomes. Thus, the study has important implications for education, training, supervision, and treatment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Hertz, Laura S",0,,801
1098,Exploring the impact of evaluating strategic options in a scenario-based multi-criteria framework,"One of the least explored aspects of scenario planning is how to assess systematically the value and robustness of strategic options after scenario development. In this context, there is growing research interest on the use of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to evaluate such options, but with very limited evidence about its performance in practice. This paper examines effects of applying in practice one of those recently proposed scenario-based MCDA methods for identifying robust options. Three public sector decision-making instances in Trinidad and Tobago are examined within an action research framework to provide insights on differences in decision-making behaviour and areas for improvement of the method. Findings from these in-depth case studies indicate that the method's main benefit was that it stimulated curiosity on how options might be improved in order to mitigate negative consequences and capitalise on opportunities across scenarios. We conclude the paper by discussing these findings and their implications to the development of the method and the evaluation of strategic options under deep uncertainty. <c2><a9> 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Ram, C and Montibeller, G",0,10.1016/j.techfore.2012.09.019,802

In addition to regular lectures, large classes' teaching based on student-generated questions was explored. In order to improve students' motivation and stimulate their curiosity, conference-lectures were adopted to deal with selected topics of wide scientific, technological and social interest. Quantitative analysis and discussion of selected case studies, together with the organization of laboratory classes based on selected enquiry-based experiments, planned and executed by students, stimulated deep learning processes. A sample of 32 students was followed in the academic year of 2000/01 and the results obtained are here discussed in comparison with those of a sample of 100 students followed in 2001/02. Particular attention was paid to the quality of classroom interactions, the use of questions by students and their views about the course design.","Teixeira-Dias, J J C and de Jesus, H P and de Souza, F N and Watts, M",0,10.1080/09500690500102813,803
1102,Special Interest Areas and Employment Skills Programming for Secondary Students with Autism,"Many students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have specialized interests and passions that are highly reinforcing. Such special interest areas (SIAs) are more than mere hobbies or simple curiosities. Rather, the SIAs of an individual with autism may be characterized by (a) significant depth and breadth of knowledge about the area, (b) difficulty attending to other important information in the environment due to preoccupation with the area, (c) engagement in prolonged periods of study related to the area, and (d) a strong intensity in focus uncommon for neurotypical peers. Although an SIA may sometimes be perceived as a barrier to learning academic skills, incorporating the interest into transition planning and employment skill training promotes a strengths-based approach. Capitalizing on student SIAs may benefit individuals with ASD while advancing an understanding and acceptance of neuro diverse individuals. This article proposes a a four-step process to provide school-based opportunities aligned with a student's SIA to improve the skills necessary for gainful employment before and after high school graduation.","Bross, Leslie Ann and Travers, Jason C",0,,804
1103,Making learning interesting and its application to the science classroom,"Generations of students are graduating from secondary school disinterested in post-secondary study of science or pursuing careers in science-related fields beyond formal education. We propose that destabilising such disinterest among future students requires science educators to begin listening to secondary school students regarding their views of how science learning is made interesting within the science classroom. Studies on students' interest in response to instructional strategies applied in the classroom communicate the opinions (i.e. the voice') of students about the strategies they believe make their classroom learning interesting. To this end, this scoping study (1) collects empirical studies that present from various science and non-science academic domains students' views about how to make classroom learning interesting; (2) identifies common instructional strategies across these domains that make learning interesting; and (3) forwards an instructional framework called TEDI ([T]ransdisciplinary Connections; Mediated [E]ngagement; Meaningful [D]iscovery; and Self-determined [I]nquiry), which may provide secondary school science teachers with a practical instructional approach for making learning science genuinely interesting among their students within the secondary school science classroom context.","Jack, Brady Michael and Lin, Huann-shyang",0,10.1080/03057267.2017.1305543,805
1104,IMPLEMENTATION OF DIDACTIC LEARNING UNITS IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"The elaboration of didactic learning units oriented to create methodological advantages for students could be an important effort of the educational process in University. The didactic learning units presented in this paper have the objective of complementing the class notes and the teacher's lectures. In order to improve the quality degree of education, these complements for students have been carried out in this work. The didactic learning units were developed for each topic in some subjects coursed in the Defense University Center of Marin (Spain) for the subject of Materials Engineering. The units try to simplify and to streamline the learning curve of the student. All of them have a common structure and explain the basic principles of the topic. At the beginning of document, the competencies of Bologna Process contained in each educational unit are detailed. Moreover, theoretical explanations about the topic are supplemented with several schemes and figures, which provide a clear view of all contents. Furthermore, they include a kind of colour speech balloons whose purpose is to exalt important concepts of the unit thematic. Other type of speech balloons shows anecdotes about lesson, which goal is to generate interest and curiosity by student. At the end of didactic learning units, there is a test with some basic questions to student self-assessment. If the subject allows practical exercises, the didactic learning unit includes some solved problems and several proposed problems. Finally, these educational documents were complemented with ``knowledge pills'', which are videos uploaded in the University network, available for students. In them, the teacher shows a presentation oriented to the educational learning unit presented.","Alvarez, Yolanda and Alfonsin, Victor and Maceiras, Rocio and Casqueiro, Carlos and Arce, Elena",0,,806
1106,Exploring the psychology of interest,"By now, the study of interest is an eclectic and sprawling area of research. Psychologists interested in emotions, aesthetics, education, metacognition, vocations, personality, life-span development, exercise science, organizational behavior, neuroscience, and text processing have intriguing ideas about what interest is and how it works. The central goal of this book is to introduce the reader to these isolated pockets of research. Using modern theories of cognition and emotion as an integrative framework, the author examines the nature of interest, what makes things interesting, the role of interest in personality, and the development of peoples idiosyncratic interests, hobbies, and avocations. His examination reveals deep similarities between seemingly different fields of psychology and illustrates the profound importance of interest, curiosity, and intrinsic motivation for understanding why people do what they do. Part I of this book explores interest as an emotion, Part II considers interests as stable aspects of personality, and Part III considers some implications for models of interest and for future research.

1107,"Curiosity Protects Against Interpersonal Aggression: Cross-Sectional, Daily Process, and Behavioral Evidence","Objective Curiosity is the propensity to recognize and seek out new information and experience, including an intrinsic interest in learning and developing one's knowledge. With few exceptions, researchers have often ignored the social consequences of being curious. Method In four studies using cross-sectional (N?=?64), daily diary (Ns?=?150 and 110, respectively), and behavioral experimental (N?=?132) designs, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in curiosity are linked to less aggression, even when people are provoked. Results We showed that both trait and daily curiosity were linked to less aggressive responses toward romantic relationship partners and people who caused psychological hurt. In time-lagged analyses, daily curiosity predicted less aggression from one day to the next, with no evidence for the reverse direction. Studies 3 and 4 showed that the inverse association between curiosity and aggression was strongest in close relationships and in fledgling (as opposed to long-lasting) romantic relationships. That is, highly curious people showed evidence of greater context sensitivity. Intensity of hurt feelings and other personality and relationship variables failed to account for these effects. Conclusions Curiosity is a neglected mechanism of resilience in understanding aggression.","Kashdan, Todd B and DeWall, C Nathan and Pond Jr., Richard S and Silvia, Paul J and Lambert, Nathaniel M and Fincham, Frank D and Savostyanova, Antonina A and Keller, Peggy S",0,10.1111/j.1467-6494.2012.00783.x,808

1109,Psychological correlates of interest in genetic testing among korean american adoptees and their parents,"Adopted persons increasingly have turned to genetic testing to obtain health information or to search for birth family. The present study investigated psychological factors that may contribute to interest among adoptees and their parents in genetic testing for the adoptee, including adoptees' ethnic identity development, their thoughts or curiosity about birth family (birth family thoughts), and the interaction of these two factors. Data were drawn from the second wave of a longitudinal study, conducted in 2014, on transracially, transnationally adopted Korean American adolescents and their adoptive parents. In a sample of 106 adolescent-parent dyads, 2 adolescents (1.89%) had undergone genetic testing. Among the dyads in which adolescents had not sought genetic testing, 47.12% of adolescents and 43.27% of parents indicated interest in genetic testing for the adolescent adoptee. Adolescents' interest in genetic testing was independent from parents' interest. Neither adolescent psychological adjustment nor physical health was related to interest in genetic testing in either adolescents or parents. Adolescents' birth family thoughts were related to adolescents' interest in genetic testing, but not to parents' interest in genetic testing for their child. This study showed ethnic identity exploration and resolution moderated the relationship between birth family thoughts and adolescents' interest in genetic testing. Results point to the relevance of birth family thoughts and identity development to genetic testing in transnational and transracial adolescent adoptees.

1111,On their own terms: First-year student interviews about everyday life research can help librarians flip the deficit script,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate how first-year students conduct everyday life research and how, if possible, their everyday research skills can inform information literacy instruction in higher education. Very few studies in information literacy emphasize existing knowledge that students bring with them to college; instead, the emphasis tends to fall on deficits in students<e2><80><99> academic research skills. Strengths-based approaches or asset-based approaches as found in the literature of psychology and education provide a basis for exploring this direction in information literacy education. Design/methodology/approach: The research used a phenomenographic methodology, interviewing 40 first-year students from two large universities, a medium-sized university and a community college. Findings: The qualitative study suggests that first-year students are capable of using information purposefully to learn or research interests that have sparked their curiosities. They are also capable of reflecting on the ways that their investigations fulfilled their purposes, resulted in unexpected outcomes or made them consider their issue in a new light. These existing capacities provide promising starting points for strengths-based approaches to information literacy instruction. Practical implications: Dialogue with students about prior research experiences enables teaching librarians to plan engaging, authentic information literacy curriculum that acknowledges existing strengths. Originality/value: This study provides a valuable contribution to empirical evidence of student research skills prior to entering higher education and suggests connections between those skills and the ACRL Information Literacy Framework. In addition, the study provides a case for strengths-based education, activating students<e2><80><99> prior knowledge to learn and create new knowledge.

Experts around the world agree that education is the key foundational building block for innovation skill development, and that the seeds of innovation--curiosity, inquisitiveness, experimentation, risk taking, teamwork, and interest in science and math--are best planted in Grades 3-7. The Canada Foundation for Innovation has invested billions of dollars since its formation in 1997 to improve Canada's performance, but our ""National"" Innovation Strategy does not click into high gear until the post-graduate level.

1117,Associations between Emotion Regulation and Parental Reflective Functioning,"Emotion regulation encapsulates the capability to successfully manage an ongoing emotional experience, particularly in social interactions, and thus may be especially significant to early parent-child relationships. In particular, the capacity to adjust emotions may support parental mentalization and reflective functioning - how parents think about their own and their child's mental states and how these mental states effect behavior. To examine this issue, we investigated the association between emotion regulation, emotion dysregulation, and parental reflective functioning in a maternal sample (N=97). We found that mothers with higher tendencies to suppress their emotions and who had more difficulties with emotion regulation engaged in greater levels of pre-mentalizing (i.e., a non-mentalizing mode). Mothers with poorer emotional awareness also evidenced less interest and curiosity in their child's mental states. Finally, mothers who reported greater difficulty setting goals also evidenced a reduced capacity to recognize that their infant's mental states are not directly observable. Taken together, our findings support the relationship between different aspects of emotion regulation and maternal reflective functioning, suggesting that emotion regulation should be integrated in empirical and intervention work that targets maternal mentalization.","Schultheis, Alysse M and Mayes, Linda C and Rutherford, Helena J V",0,10.1007/s10826-018-01326-z,814

1119,"Cultivating classroom curiosity: A quasi-experimental, longitudinal study investigating the impact of the Question Formulation Technique on adolescent intellectual curiosity","Curiosity can be defined as the ""urge to know more"" that manifests behaviorally in questioning and exploration. Curiosity is associated with a host of positive youth outcomes, including academic achievement, school engagement, and deeper learning, yet studies indicate that few teachers foster curiosity in their classrooms, possibly due to a lack of pedagogical techniques focused on inspiring student curiosity. Many scholars suggest directly teaching questioning to cultivate student curiosity; yet, relatively few empirical studies on the role of questioning in fostering curiosity have been conducted. Accordingly, the present study conducted a quasi-experimental, longitudinal investigation to examine the relationship between exposure to the Question Formulation Technique (QFT), a classroom-based intervention that seeks to teach students how to ask their own questions, and scores on curiosity and related strengths in a sample of Northeast high school students. Participating English/Language Arts faculty at four high schools (N = 2,217 students; 42 teachers) were randomly assigned to either a fall or spring start condition. The study utilized student self-report questionnaires and teacher fidelity checks at three time points (fall, winter, and spring) across schools in order to consider the potential impact of the QFT on students' curiosity, divergent thinking, school engagement, and self-efficacy. In light of prior research, it was hypothesized that the QFT would have a significant positive treatment effect on the study constructs, and would positively impact growth in these attributes. In addition, higher teacher fidelity of implementation of the intervention was expected to lead to greater growth in these attributes. Furthermore, positive and reciprocal mediational paths between curiosity, cognitive engagement, and self-efficacy were proposed. Multilevel modeling revealed the QFT to have a positive absolute treatment effect on students' curiosity, but not an impact on students' curiosity growth. In addition, high teacher fidelity, but not dosage, led to increases in students' curiosity growth over the school year. No other overall positive treatment effects were found, although fidelity and dosage were related positively to growth on several variables. In addition, multiple-group structural equation path models revealed several complex indirect and direct pathways between the four variables of interest. Most surprising, cognitive engagement served as predictors of all other variables in the model. Qualitatively, teachers discussed the impact of the QFT on student responsiveness, described adaptations they made to the intervention, and noted the need for professional development. Limitations of the current study and implications for future research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)","Clark, Shelby",0,,816

While these topics are interesting in their own right, perhaps the most compelling aspect of these fields is how the tools, which are in widespread use, have been developed by an Open Source community. Individuals across several universities and companies have worked together in a distributed fashion to build and improve the leading generation of data technologies. These Open Source principles have enabled the latest industry-adopted tools to constantly evolve at an incredible rate. One way for educators to keep pace with these developments and maintain advanced curriculum is to adopt the same collaborative principles used in open source. At the Insight Data Fellowship, we've used this open source model to provide immediate feedback and drive our curriculum forward, while fostering a culture of independence and curiosity.

1127,"Disentangling Curiosity: Dimensionality, Definitions, and Distinctions from Interest in Educational Contexts","Curiosity has received increasing attention in the educational literature, yet empirical investigations have been limited by inconsistent conceptualizations and the use of curiosity synonymously with other constructs, particularly interest. The purpose of this review is to critically examine the dimensionality, definitions, and measures of curiosity within educational settings, and address the boundaries between curiosity and interest. A systematic review of 39 articles from 2003 to 2013 revealed a reliance on self-report measures, a focus on curiosity as a personality trait, and definitions characterized by four themes, the most common of which were curiosity as a need for knowledge or information, and curiosity as a motivator of exploratory behavior. The overlap and relations between curiosity and interest are discussed, and it is proposed that an examination of (a) the role of knowledge, (b) goals and outcomes, and (c) stability and malleability provide a basis for differentiating curiosity and interest according to their essential characteristics.","Grossnickle, Emily M.",0,10.1007/s10648-014-9294-y,820

Those who oppose the use of literature in teaching composition argue future social utility and personal welfare, conceive of students as bureaucratic communicators, and concentrate on teaching subskills. The intentions of both groups seem possible and necessary. Using the prose essay-as well as poetry, fiction, and drama-allows students to see the connection between form and content and to use a form that they will regularly use. Composition teachers need to see their courses as beginning a process, as helping the students' interest and belief in language support a general growth of intellectual curiosity, and as service courses. To regard the prose essay as literature is crucial to a clear perception of composition. (TJ)","Uehling, Edward M",0,,821

1130,Family Involvement & Beyond: School-Based Child and Family Support Programs,"Teachers often spend much time attending to the needs of children who are unable to focus attention, get along with other children, control their emotions and behavior, and lack persistence and motivation. During the last few years, many schools and families have begun to move beyond the finger-pointing stage and are developing partnerships to promote the optimal development of all children, creating school communities that foster positive relationships among all members. In this report, research on resiliency, culturally responsive teaching, school reform, and characteristics of school-based child and family support programs in elementary schools are discussed, and promising practices based on research are highlighted. Following a literature review, the report describes four Northwest schools (Helen Baller Elementary School, Camas, Washington; Cherry Valley Elementary School, Polson, Montana; Mary Harrison Elementary School, Toledo, Oregon; and Richmond Elementary School, Salem, Oregon) that have integrated effective school-based child and family support into their school programs. In these schools, emotional development is enhanced through supportive relationships with teachers, child and family mentors, family advocates, and other staff members who provide opportunities for children to learn how: to recognize and manage emotions, to understand how others think and feel; and to learn collaborative approaches to resolving conflicts. The report finds that educational practices that create the conditions that foster resiliency for all include: culturally responsive teaching; a curriculum that enhances children's inherent curiosity and builds upon personal interests; staff development that emphasizes reflective study of teaching practices; and family involvement and support. Throughout the report are references to materials suitable for handouts in workshops. (Contains 123 references.) (BT)","Novick, Rebecca and Northwest Regional Educational Lab.  OR.

1132,Museo Multiverso: Bridging the Gap between Museums and Mobile Platforms,"As mobile devices have pervasively become virtually available to all, cultural institutions have been increasingly investing resources in the creation of apps that can be enjoyed on the phone. Typically such apps are built custom for specific events or exhibitions, resulting in increased IT costs that well exceed the typical costs due to the maintenance of institutional websites and the carry on of traditional marketing strategies. In this paper we describe Museo Multiverso (MuMu), a mobile publishing platform that provides a standard interface with the mobile world to museum curators and experts. Using MuMu a museum curator can populate a mobile client with any multimedia information related to an exhibition or to a network of exhibitions and easily publish such information and make it available to mobile users. MuMu is composed of two main components: a platform that museum curators can use to organize and insert the information they want to share with the public and a mobile client where users can originally enjoy all of such information. In fact, the contribution of this work is twofold: (a) from an architectural point of view, we designed and implemented a platform that can be put to good use to support virtually any number of museums and events, and, (b) from a human-computer interaction point of view we leverage on advanced interaction techniques in order to provide an easy to use interface that excites curiosity and interest.","Roccetti, Marco and Bertuccioli, Cristian and Marcomini, Andrea and Varni, Angelo and Marfia, Gustavo and Zanichelli, Marco",0,,824
1134,An intimate understanding of America's teenagers: Shaking hands with aliens,"When a person thinks that he has a lot to say and boasts himself as the expert on a subject, not much room remains for humility. That said: I can't even imagine any other adult in America who knows more about teenagers than I do. So with great pleasure-and, yes, some trepidation-I now pass along my intimate understanding of America's adolescents to parents, teachers, teenagers, and anyone else with either a vested interest or a macabre curiosity. This is no time to be humble. As I began to reflect seriously on this project-looking over my notes, collections, and memorabilia-one major theme stood out: The problems teenagers faced 40 years ago are identical to the problems they face today. A huge difference, however, is that today the intensity of those problems is way off the charts. Modern technology and more aggressive media pose challenges never conceived of in the past. The lives of teenagers have been severely complicated by negligent parenting, mix-n-match families, and an apathetic, inadequate education system. Instead of inadvertently burning down Daddy's woodshed after playing with fireworks, kids today are burning CDs about raping and mutilating women. Instead of parents and teachers and lawmakers and society looking out for kids, today's kids have been left to fend for themselves. Those who wish to crawl into the minds, hearts, and souls of America's teenagers have opened the right text. The anecdotes will amuse you; the stories will move you; the conclusions will startle you-and the prescriptions I offer you come after countless hours of observations, reflections, and analyses. An extensive career as a veteran high school English teacher, baseball coach, play director, and debate advisor has afforded me an opportunity to do an insightful examination of teenagers from the last four decades, while concentrating on the most recent generation. I also divulge some secrets from my own experiences as a teenager, sometimes causing me to shrink with embarrassment, but always with a smile on my face. Note: The students and other teens in this book are real. Their names have been changed, and/or they are composites of teenagers. Student writings and interview commentaries have been edited or paraphrased. Conversations have been recreated from my own memory, notes, and the recollections of others. All stories are true. For a better understanding of the author's insights, those prescriptive sections that are aimed at parents should be examined by teenagers, too-and vice versa. All readers may benefit from the advice offered to teachers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Gevirtzman, Bruce J",0,,825

The campaign of housing-code enforcement that followed, known as the Baltimore Plan, made the city famous. When historians write about American housing-reform efforts during the mid-20th century, they tend to focus on big-ticket federal policies; by contrast, the Baltimore Plan seems too small to be significant. But it is more than a curiosity. First in Baltimore and then across the country, the neat cause-and-effect it posited between good stewardship and good housing crowded out more challenging ways of thinking about the problem. Eventually, the Baltimore Plan turned into a policy tool that reinforced the interests of the real estate industry at the expense of poor people. In that regard, the Baltimore Plan laid the foundations for federal disinvestment in the provision of decent housing and the midcentury tragedy of urban renewal. <c2><a9> 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Lieb, E",0,10.1080/02665433.2017.1325774,826

1138,"At U. of Maryland, an Effort to Make Introductory Courses Extraordinary","Required introductory courses are as important as they are unloved. They are a key part of the general-education curriculum, which makes up as much as one-third of the typical baccalaureate student's education, and they are the subject of seemingly never-ending revitalization efforts. Many senior faculty members avoid teaching such courses because they see them as being filled with callow students with little interest in the subject. Students often see them as the curricular equivalent of eating their vegetables, the unappetizing fare they must endure before they get to the interesting parts of their educations. Critics argue that such distaste is well founded. These courses typically take the form of a slog through a discipline's ""greatest hits,"" can prove to be deadly to students' curiosity, and often serve as gatekeepers that keep them from advancing. The University of Maryland at College Park thinks it may have found a way to make these courses more engaging and rigorous. New and retooled introductory courses, called the ""I-Series,"" have spread campuswide after a two-year pilot. This fall, all incoming freshmen must take at least two I-Series courses as part of a new set of core requirements. The ""I"" refers to a litany of higher-education buzzwords beginning with that letter, including imagination, inspiration, and innovation. Jargon aside, the courses are organized around provocative questions or propositions.

1139,Coming alive: The psychotherapeutic treatment of patients with eating disorders,"Describes a dynamic psychotherapeutic approach specifically developed for women (WM) with eating disorders (EDs). Principles from contemporary psychodynamic theories that focus on subjectivity and intersubjectivity are applied to the treatment of WM with EDs and are illustrated with clinical vignettes. Theoretical models employed include intersubjective and relational theory, self psychology, and feminist psychodynamic theory. Relative unresponsiveness to a child's subjective experience and to child-initiated cues are thought to contribute to psychological disturbances among WM with EDs. These disturbances include impairment in the sense of effectiveness, in the capacity to tolerate emotions, and in the continuity and cohesiveness of self-experience. Self-imposed starvation, binge-purge episodes, and excessive exercise may act as psychic organizers in these WM. An active psychotherapeutic approach with sustained interest in the patient's authentic subjective experience promotes the identification, organization, and integration of emotional experience and the consolidation of a more differentiated sense of self. In the psychotherapeutic treatment of WM with EDs, a therapeutic posture of empathic enquiry contributes to the patient's curiosity about her own subjective world.

1140,Ten Years Old & Competent. The Fourth Stage of the Competent Children Project: A Summary of the Main Findings,"The Competent Children Project is following a group of about 500 children in the Wellington region of New Zealand from around the age of 5 until they leave school. The main aims of the project are to describe children's progress over time and to chart contributions to their progress made by family resources, early childhood education, school experiences, children's interests and activities in the home or outside school, and peer relationships. The project focuses on 10 competencies important for well-being, school achievement and continued learning, and contributing to society and paid work: literacy, mathematics, logical problem solving, communication, curiosity, perseverance, social skills with children, social skills with adults, individual responsibility, and fine motor skills. Data have been collected at ages 5, 6, 8, and 10. Among the main findings detailed in this summary report are that most 10-year-olds were comfortable in their school environment, had very good attendance, were good at making and keeping friends, needed adult intervention to work with other children over a period of time, and had progressed in reading and problem solving. Children starting school with low competency were more likely to improve if their parents were highly educated or if their family had a high income, while high-achieving students maintained their achievement level. Other factors considered as possible contributions to children's performance were early childhood education experience, school and class characteristics, teacher perspectives, gender, parental education level, and family income. The report concludes by noting that what matters in children's progress is how children interact with adults and others and how they engage in activities, particularly those that use symbols and language. A list of publications available from the Competent Children's Project concludes the report. (KB)","Wylie, Cathy and New Zealand Council for Educational Research, Wellington.",0,,830

1143,Language Micro-gaming: Fun and Informal Microblogging Activities for Language Learning,"`Learning is an active process of constructing rather than acquiring knowledge and instruction is a process of supporting that construction rather than communicating knowledge' [1]. Can this process of learning be fun for the learner? Successful learning involves a mixture of work and fun. One of the recent web 2.0 services that can offer great possibilities for learning is Microblogging [2]. This kind of motivation can raise students' natural curiosity and interest which promotes learning. Play can also promote excitement, enjoyment, and a relaxing atmosphere. As Vygotsky (1933) [3] advocates, play creates a zone of proximal development (ZDP) in children. According to Vygotsky, the ZDP is the distance between one's actual developmental level and one's potential developmental level when interacting with someone and/or something in the social environment [4]. Play can be highly influential in learning. What happens when play becomes informal learning supported by web 2.0 technologies? Practical ideas applied in an Italian foreign language classroom using microblogging to promote fun and informal learning showed that microblogging can enhance motivation, participation, collaboration and practice in basic language skills.","Perifanou, Maria A",0,,833
1144,Successful and discipline-problem students: A comparative analysis,"Studied personal and academic traits of 45 7th- and 45 8th-grade students with discipline problems. Ss were randomly selected from computer-generated lists of 3 populations: discipline problems, discipline and academic problems, and successful. Student, teacher, and counselor surveys were given. Using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, 2 contrasts were conducted: discipline problems vs successful, and discipline and academic problems vs successful. Differences were found in self-concept, drug and alcohol involvement, language, study and memory skills, concentration, disruptive behavior, and excitability. Ss with discipline problems resembled successful Ss in terms of curiosity, academic interest, enjoyment of learning, and peer relations. No group differences were found regarding the amount of TV viewing, hours slept, etc. Improving the self-concept of students and success in extracurricular activities reduce discipline problems.

1145,PÃ¨lerins Ã  JÃ©rusalem Ã  la fin du Moyen-Age,"This article contemplates the development of the pilgrimage to Jerusalem from the fall of Saint Jean d'Acre to the early 16th century, and looks at how it may have been affected by the changes taking place between Medieval times and the Renaissance. The research takes as its text the accounts of the pilgrims themselves who, at this time, were often lay members of the Church rather than clerics. As they describe the behaviour of their fellow travellers, the reader can glimpse what pilgrimage signified for the men of the late Middle Ages. The earlier accounts speak mainly of Jerusalem; while in the later ones it is the journey itself that becomes the centre of interest, with descriptions of the expenses incurred, the distances travelled, the problems of route navigation and the curiosities of the landscape traversed. The <e2><80><9c>curiositas<e2><80><9d> so often condemned by the clerics of the preceding era now takes on the aspect of a virtue. But on arrival in the Holy Land an abrupt change occurs, and the reader enters, along with the pilgrims, another era <e2><80><94> the time of the life and passion of Christ. The ritual of the pilgrimage has been laid down in great detail by the Franciscan friars, as established on Mount Sion in 1337, giving great significance to sermons and indulgences. Nevertheless, the pilgrims often speak of their personal feelings, and in this respect there is a remarkable continuity between the 4th and the 16th century. <c2><a9> 1989, SAGE Publications.

However, science museums are informal learning environments where teachers usually have very little control over the ideas being implicated or the experiments that the students carry out. It is necessary to design educational materials for the visit to the museum which integrate learning in schools and in museums, and which stimulate the interest and curiosity of the students by promoting independent learning via working in a group guided by the teacher.

Books prompt questions, which can lead to further reading about and investigation of science topics. Whether from a textbook or a nonfiction trade book, informational text can be the fuel that sparks curiosity about and interest in science, thus contributing to the development of scientific attitudes. As students read, they engage in processes common to science and literacy, such as predicting, generating questions, summarizing understandings, and using data to draw conclusions. In this article, the authors share three strategies that teachers can use to promote young children's successful interactions with informational science texts. These strategies are also useful for assessing students' science knowledge. (Contains 2 figures and 4 resources.)","Yopp, Hallie Kay and Yopp, Ruth Helen",0,,837

The Public Purpose of Higher Education,"At a time when higher education attendance has never felt more mandatory for career success and economic growth, the distinguished contributors to this provocative collection ask readers to consider the civic mission of higher education as equally vital to the nation's well-being. Should higher education serve a greater public interest? In what ways should colleges and universities be asked to participate in public controversies? What should individuals expect institutions of higher education to contribute to the development of honesty and ethical judgment in the civic sphere? What should colleges do to foster greater intellectual curiosity and aesthetic appreciation in their students and communities, and why is this important for all Americans?

In this community, children with disorders of sex development can sometimes become an object of interest and ridicule or are thought to be bewitched. Many parents of children with such disorders find it difficult to protect their offspring from the marginalization and rejection that is the consequence of such curiosity and transparency. Current research and theory pertaining to the biological and social bases of gender identity and behaviour are reviewed and their capacity to guide decisions is explored. The absence of a support group to assist these children and their parents, and the paucity of information available in the public domain, compounds an already challenging problem.

Steffens et al. report on the relationship between depression, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and future risk of progression to dementia. On the other hand, it is known that noncognitive symptoms, most particularly depression, frequently occur in those with MCI and have been shown to increase the risk of likely future decline. Finally, as with Alzheimer's disease, there is much interest in the possible role for neuroinflammation in depression which may provide a link between depression and cognitive decline. The outcomes of such mechanistic studies are not purely for scientific curiosity, but they will shed light on likely aetiological mechanisms, providing new targets towards which therapeutic interventions can be directed, with the aim of improving outcomes for those with late life depression and preventing future cognitive decline.

1162,"Pica behaviors in a German community-based online adolescent and adult sample: an examination of substances, triggers, and associated pathology","Purpose: To examine self-reported pica substances, situational triggers for, and associated psychosocial burden of pica eating in adolescents and adults in a Western European population. Methods: A total of 78 individuals aged 16<c2><a0>years and over, who indicated consuming a substance that in their opinion is not considered as food, participated in an online survey. Two questionnaires assessed eating disorder and general psychopathology, and a third asked about the substances consumed, duration and frequency of consumption, triggers for consumption, emotions thereafter, and interest in treatment. Results: The most frequently reported substances included foods in an uncooked or non-edible form, body parts/fluids, grass, leaves, paper, and earth-like substances, with 54 (69.23%) participants reporting a substance that would qualify as pica substance according to DSM-5. The main triggers for consumption were taste of the substance/indulgence, boredom, curiosity, and release of internal tension. The most common emotion after consumption was relief. Pica eating frequency was not significantly related to eating disorder and general psychopathology (both p > 0.05). A total of 24 individuals considered their pica eating as disruptive, of whom only eight declared an interest in treatment. Conclusions: The kind of substances consumed is in line with the previous reports in other populations. Pica eating does not seem to be associated with significant psychosocial burden; only a subgroup indicated that they experience it as disruptive and expressed interest in treatment. Nevertheless, for these individuals, triggers for pica eating and emotions thereafter might provide first hints for the development of interventions.

1164,Redcoats and Patriots: Reflective Practice in Drama and Social Studies. Dimensions of Drama Series,"This book describes how one New York City middle school social studies teacher challenged the traditional, textbook-driven curriculum, kindled the students' interest, and ultimately transformed both teaching methods and learning experiences through process drama. Drawing from a blend of narrative reflections and classroom-based research, the book illustrates how the teacher introduced drama into the social studies curriculum, inviting students to become participants in history rather than mere observers of it. The students investigate primary source documents, maintain journals, write letters, reconstruct events through role-play, and create scenes and tableaux. Engaged with the subject and with each other in ways previously unimagined, their curiosity and creativity are aroused as they, along with the teacher, generate a curriculum that reflects their potential and celebrates their strengths. More than just an innovative approach to teaching social studies, the book is the story of a teacher engaged in classroom-based inquiry, critically examining his pedagogical beliefs and practices in response to the realities of his classroom. As the book progresses, readers can see the teacher become empowered as he responds to, and learns from, the questions and challenges posed by his students. (BT)","Taylor, Philip",0,,847

I feel that the concepts of ""self-help"" are the key to the usefulness of this monograph, and for anyone who is lonely, whoever she or he may be. By ""Self-help"" I do not mean that we have to go it strictly alone. Whether we like it or not, we are always connected to others in some way, no matter how isolated we may feel. When we help ourselves we draw upon inner resources established over a lifetime of experience; all that we have seen and felt, heard or read about, things that we have done or had done to us. Sometimes it does not seem enough and we feel helpless and alone. Problems of loneliness will never be totally solved, yet the people in my experience seek answers that they can use. The two questions that I hear the most are, ""What do you do and other people do when they are lonely?"" and, ""How can I learn to manage my own loneliness?"" During the years that I have been involved in studying the experience of loneliness, I have found very little previous work directed towards dealing with these emotionally-charged questions. I want to do that now. My empathy is with people with such thrust of curiosity, people who are lonely now or view loneliness as a problem in their lives. I would like them to discover that their feelings need not be as crippling as they may believe-This is the goal of this monograph. My interest, then, is in presenting some of my own understanding of the experience as it has touched my life and the people I have known and worked with. The focus of this work is mainly on psychological aspects of loneliness. It is not intended as a definitive study of the subject, but is rather a pointed selection of observations and ideas about certain facets of the loneliness experience which I believe have particular, if not crucial, bearing on how we live with loneliness.

1168,Psychoanalysis and change: Between curiosity and faith,"The IPA recently announced that it now recognized three sessions per week as a valid frequency for psychoanalytic treatment. From the debate that has ensued over the problems this decision is expected to cause, important insights can he gained into the current crisis of identity afflicting psychoanalysis. Technical aspects of therapy that were once considered peripheral have gradually acquired the status of core theoretical parameters. Freud was a man of science who was concerned with universal human phenomena. His disagreements with followers such as Jung and Adler centred on the major theoretical issues of the sexual nature of the libido and the existence of the unconscious. It is also interesting to note that Freud never distinguished between psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic psychotherapy. Where he did make a distinction, it was between psychoanalysis and the consciousness-based psychotherapies, or those that used suggestion as a major tool. When the point has been reached where the frequency of sessions or the use of a couch is used to define whether a treatment is psychoanalytic, some consideration of whether the right direction is being pursued is called for A serious risk is being run of sacrificing our spirit of curiosity for the sake of tradition, becoming more concerned with repeating the formal aspects of practice than with the real purpose of psychoanalysis, the investigation of the most profound workings of human nature.","Alberto Zusman, Jose and Cheniaux, Elie and De Freitas, Sergio",0,10.1516/FPX7-DEA7-RAXM-DFBA,851
1169,"Art Response to Confusion, Uncertainty, and Curiosity During Group Art Therapy Supervision","This research project used a causal comparative design to examine differences between intact groups of graduate art therapy students using art as a response to emotions and sharing the art during group supervision. There is scant research on group art therapy supervision thus in this study the variables of curiosity and psychological mindedness were analyzed. Utilizing art making as a tool to understand emotions in response to working with clients therapeutically provides both an implicit, internal focus on the self in relation to others that is then evaluated in an explicit, external context of group supervision, where these emotions are shared. Forty participants completed response art as well as pre- and post-test inventories of the Curiosity and Exploration Inventory-II, subscales of stretching and embracing, and the Balanced Inventory of Psychological Mindedness, subscales of interest and insight. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum test and Spearmen's rho correlations. While findings were limited due to the small sample size, nonparametric measures, and confounding variables, findings confirmed that stretching and interest showed significant increases. Students later in their practicum showed an increase in embracing while group size of four or less had greater increases in insight. Insight increased early in the research study and decreased significantly at the end of this present study, suggesting that as students learn they develop a more humble stance of not knowing. Future research would benefit from a qualitative inquiry to identify and understand aspects of creating art in response to clients and sharing it in supervision.

We aimed to inform recruitment and retention strategies by exploring users' motivations and experiences in using a novel, Internet intervention, the Hello Sunday Morning (HSM) program. We conducted one-to-one, telephone-enabled qualitative interviews with 24 adult users of HSM (50 percent female; M-age = 42.42 years), purposively selected to ensure diversity in demographics and drinking levels. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Two themes, each with two subthemes were identified: (1a) pathway to HSM: HSM attracted participants seeking help for alcohol-related problems, and those not yet seeking help; (1b) format and framing: the positive, nonthreatening framing and anonymous, convenient format enabled participants to join out of interest, curiosity, or desire for a challenge; (2a) support and normalization: participants gained social support from other users, and their problems with alcohol and desire to seek help were normalized; (2b) goal setting and self-monitoring: setting goals and monitoring progress provided participants with motivation and self-accountability. We conclude that evidence-based behavior change techniques, including social support, normative strategies, goal setting, and self-monitoring, were appealing to users. These aspects could be incorporated into other programs to recruit participants who might otherwise avoid or delay seeking help.","Black, Nicola and Loomes, Max and Juraskova, Ilona and Johnston, Ian",0,10.1089/cyber.2019.0289,853

For this reason, he gives them Neil Postman's ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"" to read, a book which shows that the late 20th century is undergoing a vast epistemological shift, moving from the ""typographic mind"" to the ""age of show business."" Postman concerns himself with the formal structures of human thinking and points to the invention of the telegraph and modern advertising methods in the 1890s as the germinal source in this epistemological shift. For him, technology ""legitimized"" the idea of context-free information, focusing on novelty, interest, and curiosity. Television's power lies in the seduction of an image; Postman's purpose is ""to make the epistemology of television visible again."" The book surveys and analyzes the effects of television on various forms of public discourse: news, religion, political discussion and campaigning, and education. Postman notes that television's contribution to educational philosophy is the idea that teaching and entertainment are inseparable--an idea he finds lethal to students' ability to develop critical thinking. The first assignment asked the students to write three sentences in their notebooks that they thought captured Postman's essential point in any given chapter, and also asked for questions. The students moved from halting guesses to clear and confident assessments--they read better. Examples of their comments illustrate their progression in critical thinking.

1174,Executive Functioning Predicts Reflective Functioning in Mothers,"Parental reflective functioning (PRF) describes a parent's capacity for considering both their own and their child's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, which can help parents to guide interactions with children. Given the cognitive demands of keeping infants in mind whilst caregiving, we examined the association between aspects of executive function (i.e., working memory and set-shifting) and PRF (employing the Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire) in recent mothers. In Study 1 (N = 50), we found that better working memory was associated with higher levels of maternal interest and curiosity in their child's feelings. In Study 2 (N = 68), we found that visual working memory and set-shifting capacity were also associated with higher levels of maternal interest and curiosity in their child's thoughts and feelings. Our results provide preliminary support for the association between executive processes and maternal reflective functioning. The implications of these findings and important future directions are discussed, including advancing our understanding of executive processes and PRF to support the broader family system.","Rutherford, Helena J V and Byrne, Simon P and Crowley, Michael J and Bornstein, Jonathan and Bridgett, David J and Mayes, Linda C",0,10.1007/s10826-017-0928-9,856

1177,Integrating personality and career adaptability into vocational interest space,"The relations between interests, personality and career adaptability were explored in two separate studies. In the first study, the RIASEC measure Occupational Preference Scale was applied along with personality inventories HEXACO-PI-(R)-100 and IPIP-50 on a sample of 602 university students and young adults. In the second study, PGI-Short, HEXACO-60 and Career Adapt-Abilities Scale were applied on a sample of 981 high-school graduates. Results from both studies were discussed together, and general conclusions about overlapping of interests, personality and career adaptability domains were drawn on the basis of correlational analyses and property vector fitting. Both studies have shown weak to moderate relations between interests and personality. In the HEXACO framework, it was found that Openness to Experience was positively related to creative interests, Emotionality was positively related to social interests and negatively related to technical interests, Extraversion was positively related to social and managing interests, and Honesty-Humility was negatively related to interests for business and finance. In the Big Five framework, Agreeableness was related to Social and Artistic interests, and Intellect to Artistic interests. The HEXACO personality domains showed predictive advantage for explaining interests in comparison to Big Five dimensions. The relation between career adaptability and interests was weak, and almost negligible when personality was included in hierarchical regression analysis. Career adaptability was weakly related to highly prestigious interests. Adaptability facets Concern, Control and Confidence were oriented toward data pole of interest space. The general factor of interests was weakly correlated with Openness Extraversion, Career Adaptability, and adaptability facets Confidence and Curiosity. Observed findings are as expected and in line with previous research. <c2><a9> 2016 Elsevier Inc.","<c5><a0>verko, I and Babarovi<c4><87>, T",0,10.1016/j.jvb.2016.02.017,858

1183,ON SPECIFIC PROBLEMS OF COMPUTERIZATION OF SOCIETY,"New technologies have brought significant changes in understanding of knowledge and education. Computers and the Internet have revolutionized the field of pedagogy enabling easier communication between a teacher and students, simplifying the process of gaining information, creating all the comfort necessary for studying and scholar work. However, serious problems emerged as besides effects - plagiarism, goggling things instead of studying them, questionable reliability of information, globalization, and computerization of knowledge connected with ignorance of facts that cannot be accessed online. In the situation of information overload the main task of pedagogy seems to be to teach critical thinking, intellectual creativity and interest in ``alternative'' ways of education. It is also crucial to state the true nature of the process of education shifting its meaning from a popular ``enjoy yourself'' to curiosity, concentration and hard work, inspiration from the past achievements. The main aim of this process is to educate generation able to preserve and develop cultural heritage of the West.","Brosinger, Zuzana",0,,861
1184,"Freud's ""moses"": Memory material and immaterial (Sigmund Freud, Austria)","Freud's final book, Moses and Monotheism, has long been regarded as an autobiographical curiosity which, while shedding light on his feelings about his own Jewishness, potentially compromises some of the more convincing aspects of psychoanalytic theory. I consider Moses and Monotheism as a serious work in which Freud proposes a theory of Jewishness---what it is, how it is transmitted, and how it continues to survive. Rather than being an aberration, this work is the culmination of a lifetime of work investigating the relationships between memory and its rivals: history, heredity and fantasy. Throughout his career, Freud attempted to synthesize what he saw as the two possible sources of mental illness: the first, innate disposition, and the second, external trauma resulting in pathogenic memories. The tension between these two realms---permanent inheritance and malleable experience---would become central to his theory of Jewishness. By proposing that certain events in the distant past were so traumatic that their memories were inherited by successive generations, Freud eventually integrated these previously mutually exclusive realms---the biological, permanent and racial on the one hand, and the psychic, experiential and cultural on the other. In Moses and Monotheism he theorized that Jewishness is constituted by the inheritance of a specific archaic memory which one is inexorably compelled to transmit to future generations, whether consciously or unconsciously. As such, I consider Freud's theory of Jewishness as a racial theory of memory. Freud's interest in the inheritance of memory is contextualized alongside scientific and political debates of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. A close reading of Freud's Moses shows that it retrospectively illuminates recurring questions and concepts in his earlier work and in current debates about race, memory, and psychoanalysis. I combine literary scholarship with research in the history of science in an attempt to understand what Freud thought he was doing in developing a racial theory of Jewishness at a time when race was being used to identify and exterminate the Jewish people. This study examines the permeable boundaries between history and literature, race and culture, and politics and science.

The program was introduced into an educational system without any tradition in single-sex education. Important observations made during the process included the considerable interest in mathematics and curiosity about computer science found among female students at the secondary school level, and the acceptance of the single-sex program by the staff, administration, and management of the university as well as among male and female students. The process described highlights the importance of preparing the environment for a totally new type of educational program.","Brandell, G and Carlsson, S and Ekblom, H and Nord, A.-C.",0,10.1007/BF03217321,863
1187,Measuring Epistemic Curiosity and Its Diversive and Specific Components,"A questionnaire constructed to assess epistemic curiosity (EC) and perceptual curiosity (PC) curiosity was administered to 739 undergraduates (546 women, 193 men) ranging in age from 18 to 65. The study participants also responded to the trait anxiety, anger, depression, and curiosity scales of the State-Trait Personality Inventory (STPI; Spielberger et al., 1979) and selected subscales of the Sensation Seeking (SSS; Zuckerman, Kolin, Price, & Zoob, 1964) and Novelty Experiencing (NES; Pearson, 1970) scales. Factor analyses of the curiosity items with oblique rotation identified EC and PC factors with clear simple structure. Subsequent analyses of the EC items provided the basis for developing an EC scale, with Diversive and Specific Curiosity subscales. Moderately high correlations of the EC scale and subscales with other measures of curiosity provided strong evidence of convergent validity. Divergent validity was demonstrated by minimal correlations with trait anxiety and the sensation-seeking measures, and essentially zero correlations with the STPI trait anger and depression scales. Male participants had significantly higher scores on the EC scale and the NES External Cognition subscale (effect sizes of r =.16 and.21, respectively), indicating that they were more interested than female participants in solving problems and discovering how things work. Male participants also scored significantly higher than female participants on the SSS Thrill-and-Adventure and NES External Sensation subscales (r =.14 and.22, respectively), suggesting that they were more likely to engage in sensation-seeking activities.","Litman, Jordan A. and Spielberger, Charles D.",0,10.1207/S15327752JPA8001_16,864
1188,The epistemic value of curiosity,"In this essay, Frederick Schmitt and Reza Lahroodi explore the value of curiosity for inquiry and knowledge. They defend an appetitive account of curiosity, viewing curiosity as a motivationally original desire to know that arises from having one's attention drawn to the object and that in turn sustains one's attention to it. Distinguishing curiosity from wonder, the authors explore several sources of the epistemic value of curiosity. First, curiosity is tenacious: curiosity whether a proposition is true leads to curiosity about related issues, thereby deepening our knowledge. Second, it is to some extent biased in favor of topics in which we already have a practical or epistemic interest. Third, and most important, curiosity is largely independent of our interests: it fixes our attention on objects in which we have no antecedent interest, thereby broadening our knowledge. Schmitt and Lahroodi elucidate the value of curiosity by outlining its role in levels of development - an approach indebted to John Dewey's explanation of the value of curiosity. Finally, they raise some questions about the implications of their account for educational practice. <c2><a9> 2008 Board of Trustees.","Schmitt, F F and Lahroodi, R",0,10.1111/j.1741-5446.2008.00281.x,865
1189,Instruments and Implements of Enquiry Based Learning,"Enquiry, Inquiry, Problem Solving etc. are all different terms describing one outcome, that is creating an environment where students are driven by curiosity, involved and in charge of their learning. The problem of a traditional classroom has always been that students are spoon fed with information and most of it is lost in time if it is not used and applied. This paper introduces enquiry based learning and explores the important factors that assist teachers in using it easily in their classrooms. This document reviews selected studies articles to try to produce simplified a document to assist teachers in using inquiry-based learning in their classrooms. This paper will assist not only teachers but also school leaders in defining the most important criteria for preparing and conducting a classroom rich with enquiry based learning. The study may also assist them in identifying strategies to help make the classroom environment more enquiry driven. This will in turn enable students to investigate and develop their potentials based on their own unique interests. Providing students with such an environment will encourage them to become valuable contributors in the school as well as in their communities.","Al-Sabbagh, Samah",0,,866

It was modified by flashback and anticipation to produce four additional versions. In Experiment 1, the following responses were collected: Curiosity, Excitement, Imagery, Impact, Interest, Pleasure, Pleasure at the Ending, Surprise, Surprise at the Ending, Suspense; moreover, readers were asked to judge characteristics of the text, that is Coherence, Facility, and Postdictability. Results show that three dimensions underlie narrative reception: Involvement while Reading, Evaluation of the Outcome, and Cognitive Evaluation. In Experiment 2, at pre-established points, readers were asked to evaluate some responses belonging to the first dimension, namely Curiosity, Interest, Pleasure, and Excitement. The analyses show different trends in text reception according to text structure.

1194,"Converging Science and Literature Cultures: Learning Physics via ""The Little Prince"" Novella","Primary level education follows a pedagogy model where literature and science have been historically separated. Natural children processes are disrupted, as learning based on play curiosity is completely transformed by a chalkboard model. Specific experimental realizations can link thinking processes based on science to study problems contextualized by literature. Converging the essences of these two cultures has the potential to enhance the education experience, dramatically. This paper proposes a new didactic strategy using experimental demonstrations based on ""The Little Prince"" story, providing a journey through different philosophical questions about nature and Universe laws. Therefore, the story is used as a scientific metaphor applied to a teaching-learning situation. A workshop was implemented to a group of 26 students attending sixth grade (mean age = 12 years old), from two primary schools located in Heredia, Costa Rica. In order to evaluate the sessions' performance, Pearson's [chi-squared] test for independence was used to contrast association within a set of variables related to perception of learning processes and emerging interest in science. Overall 77% of the students perceived an increased interest in science, despite gender characteristics. Curiously, a gender association was observed related to the preferences girls and boys have for specific experimental demonstrations. Additionally, 92% of the students perceived learning of scientific concepts after the sessions delivered. Our research establishes a new didactic strategy with the potential to break historical pedagogical patterns and could pave the way into integration of contrasting disciplines.","God<c3><ad>nez-Sand<c3><ad>, A and Fallas-Padilla, D and Espa<c3><b1>a-Tapia, S and Z<c3><ba><c3><b1>iga-Villegas, A and Castro, Milena and Herrera-Sancho, O A",0,,870
1195,Educational website design of innovation competition using superconductor for magnetic levitation,"The objective of this research was to design an educational website to support an innovation design competition for high-school students in Taiwan dealing with superconductors for magnetic levitation. Multimedia presentation techniques played an important role in this educational website. It is important to note that a simple and meaningful animation is worth a thousand words. The major content of the website not only includes the announcements and rules of the competition, and the evolutions and theories of high-temperature superconductors but also includes manufacturing processes, application examples and the prospects for high-temperature superconductors. Some of the major theories were explained using animated multimedia techniques. The content of the website aroused so many of the students' curiosity and interest in high-temperature superconductors that an unexpected 660 teams (3006 students) registered for the first year's competition. A preliminary quiz via the Internet on the basics of high-temperature superconductors was required to enter the first-stage competition in the second year. Although the number of contest teams was reduced, the quality of the final results was more innovative and constructive. The remarkable outcome encouraged us to post the preliminary quiz for the third and fourth years. To evaluate the performance of the educational website, we conducted a survey over the Internet to obtain information and then analyzed it. Some convincing results showed that creative animation and a multimedia presentation could convince more high-school students to join the competition by arousing their interest in high-temperature superconductor research.","Shieh, Meng-Dar and Chen, In-Gann and Yu, Fu-Yun and Huang, Jun-Fu and Tang, H Y and Wu, M K",0,,871

The project is structured using modem teaching theories which encourage student curiosity and creativity. The experience develops team-work and communication, and helps to break-down cultural and linguistic barriers between students from different countries and backgrounds. The approach provides a framework for other hands-on research projects which aim to inspire young students to undertake a career in engineering. The project is part of the Clifton Scientific Trust's annual UK-Japan Young Scientist Workshop Programme. The work focuses on compressor design for jet engines and gas turbines. It includes lectures introducing students to turbomachinery concepts, a computational design study of a compressor blade section, experimental tests with a low-speed cascade and tutorials in data analysis and aerodynamic theory. The project also makes use of 3D printing technology, so that students go through the full engineering design process, from theory, through design, to practical experimental testing. Alongside the academic aims, students learn what it is like to study engineering at university, discover how to work effectively in a multinational team, and experience a real engineering problem. Despite a lack of background in fluid dynamics and the limited time available, the lab work and end of project presentation show how far young students can be stretched when they are motivated by an interesting problem.","Grimshaw, S D and Sequeira, C L and Hewkin-Smith, M",0,,872
1199,Practicing politics: Female political scientists as candidates for elective office,"In 2007, University of Oklahoma political science professor Cindy Simon Rosenthal was elected mayor of Norman, Oklahoma, after having served as a member of its city council. Was her activity unique within the political science profession among female political scientists? Her election stimulated the curiosity of some of us in the women-and-politics-research community. To what extent had female political scientists attempted to move from the ""Ivory Tower"" to the ""Public Square"" as elective office holders? What had their experiences been like? We explore those questions with particular interest in a number of theoretical propositions from women and politics studies. For example, how did they decide to seek elective office? Were they self-starters or had they been recruited? What role did their families play in their campaigns? To what extent was gender perceived as a factor, and in what ways in their various campaigns? How successful were they, and what role did their academic credentials play in their campaigns? Did their quests for public office affect their academic careers? Did they use the findings from the women and politics literature to inform their quests? Perhaps, too, we thought, their campaigns might provide distinctive insights about running for and serving in public office and inform discussion about the role of gender in political life.

1200,The uplift book of child culture,"Child study has, in the past, concerned educators, more than parents, probably because of the lack of literature adapted to guide fathers and mothers in studying their own children. Child-training and culture must be preceded by systematic child-study. Knowledge of the individual child is essential. Most parents willingly admit their limited knowledge of the child and its needs. There is theoretical literature along the lines of child-study, but it has been written principally for teachers, and is almost unknown to parents, even if suited for their assimilation and needs. This book has been planned and written to aid parents in solving their individual problems of child training, management and culture. It aims to show how to understand the child's mind, which is the foundation of training, then how to apply to the individual child, the modern, scientific and successful methods which the authors explain. Adults often fail to realize that the child mind differs from the mind of a mature man or woman. The difference appears almost self-evident, yet we constantly observe parents expecting children to act from the same motives as a grown person would naturally have, and to take the same views of subjects as older people accept through their experience. To understand a child's mind one must eliminate practically all knowledge gained by observation, experience and reading. Notice must be taken of instinctive and hereditary traits, the eagerly questioning child nature, the vivid imagination and the newly developed, hence limited, reasoning powers. Parents must know the child mind in order to understand the child. The book is bound to be practically useful and to aid in the uplift of child life, which is the greatest work that can engage our labors. While written primarily for mothers and fathers, it can profitably be read and studied by the children who are old enough to read. The training of children and the training of parents are one. Plato said: ""The best way of training the young is to train yourself at the same time; not to admonish them, but to be always carrying out your own principles in practice."" The book is therefore given to parents with the earnest hope that it will aid in the solution of their problems in child-culture and play a part in the great work of developing a nobler and better generation of men and women.

1201,A Pilot Study to Assess Feasibility of Lay Representation in Dental School Admissions Interviews,"Regulatory bodies in the dental profession often include members of the public as a way to ensure that patient interests are represented. With student selection for admission to dental school being a multifaceted, highly competitive process, this study was motivated by curiosity about the value of involving members of the public in the admissions process. At Newcastle University School of Dental Sciences, UK, semi-structured selection interviews conducted by two members of the faculty staff are part of the process. In the 2016-17 and 2017-18 admissions cycles, four lay representatives joined a number of the interview sessions. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of having a lay person present during the selection interview and whether this could become an integral part of the admissions process. A secondary purpose was to internally validate the processes in place for the interviews by considering the alignment of judgments of the panel and lay representatives. This study followed a two-stage, mixed-methods design. Quantitative analysis compared numerical interview scores awarded by the panel and lay representative when present. Scores for each question domain and overall interview score were compared. Qualitative analysis was carried out by conducting a focus group with lay representatives to seek insight into their experience and reflections on the interview processes. Thematic analysis was used, and overarching themes identified. The results showed no statistically significant difference between the interview panel and lay persons' scores for each domain or overall score awarded for the interview. The thematic analysis identified three overarching themes: reason for volunteering, process and training, and thoughts on style of interview used. These results suggest that involvement of lay people from the local community was feasible, and there was interest in continuing this involvement from the volunteers themselves. <c2><a9> American Dental Education Association","Bateman, H and Smith, M and Melvin, C and Holmes, R D and Valentine, R A",0,10.21815/JDE.019.077,875
1203,Social causes of psychological distress,"A core interest of social science is the study of stratification--inequalities in income, power, and prestige. Few persons would care about such inequalities if the poor, powerless, and despised were as happy and fulfilled as the wealthy, powerful, and admired. Social research often springs from humanistic empathy and concern as much as from scholarly and scientific curiosity. An economist might observe that black Americans are disproportionately poor, and investigate racial differences in education, employment, and occupation that account for disproportionate poverty. A table comparing additional income blacks and whites can expect for each additional year of education is thus as interesting in its own right as any dinosaur bone or photo of Saturn. However, something more than curiosity underscores our interest in the table. Racial differences in status and income are a problem in the human sense. Inequality in misery makes social and economic inequality personally meaningful. There are two ways social scientists avoid advocacy in addressing issues of social stratification. The first way is to resist projecting personal beliefs, values, and responses as much as possible, while recognizing that the attempt is never fully successful. The second way is by giving the values of the subjects an expression in the research design. Typically, this takes the form of opinion or attitude surveys. Researchers ask respondents to rate the seriousness of crimes, the appropriateness of a punishment for a crime, the prestige of occupations, the fair pay for a job, or the largest amount of money a family can earn and not be poor, and so on. The aggregate judgments, and variations in judgments, represent the values of the subjects and not those of the researcher. They are objective facts with causes and consequences of interest in their own right. This work is an effort to move methodology closer to human concerns without sacrificing the scientific grounds of research as such. <c2><a9> 2003 by Taylor & Francis.

1204,A computational model for the endogenous arousal of thoughts through Z*-numbers,"Natural language provides a rich combinatorial mechanism for encoding meanings - a finite set of words can express an unbounded number of thoughts. Framed in 2015 to extend the purpose of Zadeh's Z-numbers, a Z*-number is a perceptual symbol of the meaning of a natural language expression and consequently mentalese or internal speech. This article, through decomposition of the Z(x)-macro-parameters into its atomic constituents, presents a model for the endogenous arousal of thoughts during empathetic, bespoke comprehension of the real-world. Based on Minsky's Society of Mind, the framework is founded on the assimilation of multimodal experiences, a sense of `unified self and its derivatives (choice, interest, curiosity,etc.), objective and subjective components of knowledge, commonsense, and attention dynamics over a real-world scenario. The model attempts emulation of slow and fast thinking, instinctive reactions, learning, deliberation, reflection and self-conscious decisions. The design has been validated against human responses, and aims to contribute to the development of autonomous artificial systems for man-machine symbiosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

To achieve this, we analyzed data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment, which had science as its focus. Consistently, our findings show that science students who report experiencing low levels of inquiry-oriented learning activities are found to have above-average levels of science literacy, but below-average levels of interest in science, and below-average levels on six variables that reflect students' engagement in science. Our findings show that the corollary is also true. Across the three countries, students who report high levels of inquiry-oriented learning activities in science are observed to have below-average levels of science literacy, but above-average levels of interest in learning science, and above-average engagement in science. These findings appear to run counter to science education orthodoxy that the more students experience inquiry-oriented teaching and learning, the more likely they are to have stronger science literacy, as well as more positive affect toward science. We discuss the implications of these findings for science educators and researchers.

We will show our projects that we conduct with students - at the University of Gdansk, in the College - Athenaeum in Gdansk, and in the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, may provide inspiration for the upbringing and education activities of other teachers and show that science can be also a lot of fun and adventure.","Banasiak, M A and Karczmarzyk, M",0,,880
1211,"Characteristics of Exemplary Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)-Related Experiential Learning Opportunities","Experiential opportunities at the secondary level give students the ""intimate and necessary relation between the processes of actual experience and education"" (Dewey, 1938, p. 19-20). Career and Technical Education classes (CTE) and co-curricular experiences, one type of experiential learning, underpin and cultivate student curiosity and often channel interests into STEM-related post-secondary disciplines and career choices. There is little existent research on the characteristics of exemplary experiential learning opportunities and the impact on stakeholders. This study is intended to identify the qualities and characteristics of an exemplary secondary experience through the lived experiences of the stakeholders; students, STEM-related teachers, and CTE/STEM Administrators. A qualitative research design was used to examine characteristics and implications for students of four STEM-related programs throughout Virginia. Conclusions from the study include fundamental principles for providing exemplary experiential STEM-related learning opportunities. These principles include: providing hands-on, real world learning opportunities for students, providing learning opportunities that will enhance student ownership in their learning, providing unique and comprehensive career exploration opportunities for students, providing a schedule for teachers that will give them time to plan, deliver, and manage ""exemplary experiential"" learning opportunities, providing continual teacher and administrator in-service training relative to planning and implementing ""exemplary experiential"" learning opportunities, investing appropriate funds for providing ""exemplary experiential"" learning opportunities. Establishing and maintaining active partnerships with business/industry and colleges/universities, and maintaining active advisory communities, providing appropriate staff to support the provision of ""exemplary experiential"" learning opportunities is needed. The need for adequate funding, improving perception of CTE and STEM programs, and small class sizes was also recommended.

1213,Recollection and location in Elizabeth Bishop's Geography III,"This article addresses the issue of recollection and location in the modern American poet Elizabeth Bishop's Geography III. Focusing on ""In the Waiting Room,"" ""Crusoe in England,"" ""The Moose"" and ""One Art,"" it argues that Bishop's curiosity about the specificities of time and place manifests her interest in how the experiences are transformed through the process of describing them; in other words, how perspective of observation changes with time and place.","Zhang, Y",0,,882
1219,Do not teach algorithms,"A teacher of Computer Science and Mathematics has two options: use precious classroom time in routine operations and boring formulas, thus killing the interest of students and hampering their intellectual development, or challenge their curiosity by formulating interesting and stimulating questions giving them a taste for independent thinking. The teacher need only provide the building blocks and let students themselves form more complex structures, providing them timely hints when needed. In this paper we demonstrate how a very simple procedure can be used, with minor modifications, as a building block to solve a variety of seemingly unrelated problems in the field of graph algorithms.","Iqbal, M A and Tahir, S",0,,883
1220,Academic intrinsic motivation and perceived academic competence in Greek elementary students with and without learning disabilities,"The aim of this study was to examine differences in intrinsic motivation and perceived academic competence as well as in their association between 5th- and 6th-grade students with learning disabilities (LD) (n = 40) and their typically achieving peers. Participants were 980 Greek elementary students from the metropolitan area of Athens. As predicted, students with LD showed lower intrinsic motivation and perceived academic competence than students without LD almost across all subscales. Exceptions were noticed in intrinsic motivation concerning curiosity/interest and history subscales as well as perceptions of academic competence in the subjects of history and science. Support was found that among typically achieving students intrinsic motivation was positively and significantly related at a moderate level to perceived academic competence across all subscales, as opposed to students with LD, for whom few correlations were found.

1221,The foundations of character: Being a study of the tendencies of the emotions and sentiments,"A scientific treatment should not diminish, but increase the general interest taken in character. To bring together the various aspects of the subject, which, in literature, are treated in isolation from one another; to lead up to a general conception of it; to study the methods by which the knowledge of it may be increased in accuracy and extent; these are to make approaches to a scientific treatment of character. While I have had chiefly to confine myself to a study of the tendencies of the emotions and sentiments, this has been, throughout, my aim. This book, then, is a study of method. Yet I do not claim that this method is essentially new. It is in the main the hypothetical method of the sciences; it has had to be adapted to the treatment of character: that is all. A complete science of mind would include a science of character. The best approach to such a science is through the study of the primary emotions and their connected instincts. This study is to be directed to an analysis of tendencies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Shand, Alexander F",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/10666-000,885
1223,EXPLORING MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGIES: A LABORATORY APPROACH TO THE,"The present work consists in an experimental research based on teaching and learning Biology in primary school. The aims of this research are two. First, it wants to support the current scientific evidence that underlines the effectiveness of laboratory didactics. Secondly, it aims to prove that this method makes it possible to deal with several topics which are not currently mentioned in the Italian Guidelines. Nowadays, scientific evidence demonstrates that laboratory didactics has a stronger impact on lifelong learning than traditional didactic approaches, based on frontal lessons only. The epistemological and methodological structure is clear: Science, especially Biology, should not just be taught for their products (concepts, theories, innovations,) but also, and especially, for their processes. Therefore, laboratory activities, conducted through experimental methods, represent one of the best resources in order to develop problem-solving skills, which underline a scientific mind. In the laboratory, every question or curiosity opens to new discoveries. In this way students gradually come to formalize their scientific knowledge. The teacher's role is to suspend his immediate explanation. He should be able to support spontaneous questions by students and the possibility to make hypothesis based on their naive theories. Starting from children's curiosity, it also makes possible to consider aspects that really intrigue them but which are usually omitted by school programs, as they are considered too ``far'' from pupils' actual cognitive ability. Children, unlike adults, do not tend to take anything for granted and are fascinated and intrigued by everything is around them, regardless of its hypothetical complexity. For this reason, teaching Biology in this way means to support students' intrinsic motivation, giving them not only scientific notions, but also concrete answers with practical implications in their daily lives. In this research, we followed children's interest for the microscopic world and we treated microbiology and its biotechnological applications in food industry. We started from bread and yogurt productions, which are very close to students' reality, in order to introduce the topic of biotechnological applications using yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacteria (Streptococcus termophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus). It was surprising for children to ``discover'' that the dough of a bakery product or a dairy product is actually a living material. As a matter of fact, the billion cells of living microorganisms, the yeasts and the bacteria, are in fact the protagonists of fermentation processes. In conclusion, considering the outcomes of our research, it is clear that the educational implications of laboratory didactics are very significant and therefore not negligible. Moreover, this work would be an exhortation to teachers to use this method and to become a potential changing agent.","Lago, Anna and Masiero, Silvia and Bramuzzo, Simone and Callegaro Erica and and Poloni, Elena and Corra, Francesca and Santovito, Gianfranco",0,,886
1224,Try This: Draw Like a Scientist,"Young children love to draw, and should be encouraged to explore drawing as a communication tool. Drawing is a means by which children can express their thoughts, interests and feelings, long before they learn to write. We know that: ""children's drawings are vehicles for expression and communication"" (Chang, 2012, p. 187). This form of communication can also be used by teachers to help children develop the scientific skills of making and recording observations. This article provides the fourth in a series of hands-on activities designed for early childhood students to encourage their natural curiosity and promote development in scientific thinking.","Preston, Christine",0,,887
1225,"In memoriam: Leo Berman, M.D","Presents an obituary of Leo Berman psychoanalyst, educator, research worker and a member of the Editorial Board of the journal since 1954 died in Newton, Massachusetts, on December 27, 1958, after a long illness. Dr. Berman was on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School and Director of the Unit of Psychoanalytic Group Psychology at the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. At the time of his death, he was directing a project investigating the application of group dynamics to the education of resident physicians and student nurses, assisted by younger colleagues whom he was training. Leo Berman always stressed the great importance of the man himself. His material needs were modest, his appearance sensitive and ascetic; his needs to know, to understand and to help were great. With his innate curiosity, and marked intellectual interest, he sought knowledge in the fields of art atomic physics. For Leo Berman this was not so. Although his roots were in a profession, his branches spread in many diverse directions, with great enrichment of the tree itself and of all those who had contact with him . His indomitable courage, his ability to face reality and to continue his work until the very end, despite several physical difficulties, will remain as an inspiration to his family and friends.

1228,Watching vs. Taking,"The growing interest in wildlife watching draws attention to a growing perceptual chasm, or difference of fundamental values and sensibilities, between those who view wildlife as a resource to be exploited, and those who share a resurgent awareness of wild animals as our co-inhabitants on a fragile planet. The interest in watching may also reflect a new kind of frontier for human curiosity. Over the past millennium, the goals of exploration were geographical-and strange beasts or trees encountered along the way were seen mainly as curiosities. Now, the goals of exploration are increasingly those of understanding the nature of the world we have conquered. The geographical mysteries have given way to new ecological and biological ones. Close watching of wildlife has led to the realization that many animals have surprising levels of intelligence and social organization, and that many plants play powerful and complex ecological roles as well. In an era of dangerously unsustainable human domination, it is of growing interest that many of the animals we have considered our inferiors have in fact thrived for millions of years longer than we have, and have proven to be masters of adaptability and survival. Whatever our reasons for watching, we are less inclined now to take wildlife for granted. On balance, if carefully managed, nature tourism offers large benefits to the environment. Wildlife watchers, a relatively affluent and well educated lot on the whole, are usually willing to pay for their watching-and their economic clout favors protection of the places where they like to do it. A 1995 survey by the Travel Industry Association of America found that 83 percent of U.S. travelers are inclined to support 'green' travel companies and are willing to spend, on average, 6.2 percent more for travel services and products provided by environmentally responsible travel suppliers.","Youth, H",0,,889
1230,The Development of Children's Motivation in the Homeschool Setting,"This study examined factors related to intrinsic motivation for learning and psychological need fulfillment in the home-school setting. Participating in the study were 60 families who home-schooled at least 1 child between ages 6 and 16. Families were recruited directly at meetings of home-schooling groups in Massachusetts. Parents were interviewed in their homes. The parent and participating child separately completed questionnaires; questionnaires were read aloud to younger children. Intrinsic motivation for learning was operationalized as the sum of subscales from the Scale of Intrinsic Versus Extrinsic Orientation in the Classroom, with items adapted for home rather than classroom education. These subscales included preference for challenge, curiosity/interest, independent mastery, independent judgment, and internal criteria for success. The child's personality was assessed using a four-factor measure of personality (agreeableness, intellect, extroversion, neuroticism). The degree to which psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness were being fulfilled was measured through child questionnaires. Findings indicated that parental supportiveness of autonomy was related with the child's intrinsic motivation for learning, as was the child's intellect personality factor score, the number of years the child had been home-schooled, and the child's age. Environmental conditions marked by high levels of autonomy supportiveness and support for perceived relatedness were associated with higher levels of children's psychological need fulfillment, as were high scores on the intellect personality factors.

1232,"Rewards and Intrinsic Motivation: A Needs-Based, Developmental Perspective","This chapter reframes, from a developmental, self-worth perspective, the longstanding debate over the presumed negative impact of extrinsic rewards on subject-matter appreciation and creative expression. The chapter argues that the debate over the potentially adverse effects of extrinsic payoffs is largely misplaced because of a narrow, almost exclusive focus on the tangible attributes of rewards as the cause of their adverse effect. The proper concern in the debate on the effects of rewards should be more with their meaning as a measure of self-definition rather than their tangible attributes and with their withdrawal as a means of control rather than the offering of rewards. To promote a developmental perspective to the question, the chapter uses data from Berkeley college students' recollections of forces influencing their willingness to learn for its own sake throughout their education. These data showed that students' personal interest and curiosity in learning increased incrementally from elementary to high school, with a slight dip in middle school, and dropped precipitously after college entry. The possibility that competition for scarce valued rewards is the major cause of intrinsic disengagement is discussed, drawing on findings from the Berkeley student study and other research. Possible contributors to task engagement were identified as task success, personal meaning of the task, and task-focused reasons for engagement rather than self-aggrandizement or self-protection. The chapter concludes by asserting that when properly employed by educators, tangible reinforcers can encourage adolescents' intrinsically-oriented goals. (Contains 41 references.)

1233,Why do consumers research their ancestry? Do self-uncertainty and the need for closure influence consumer's involvement in ancestral products?,"This article examines why consumers choose to research their ancestry using commercial available products. Prior research suggests this is a voyage of personal discovery. We take this voyage and review consumer interest in ancestral products (e.g., DNA services) that is driven by a consumer's uncertainty about their sense of self. Focusing on uncertainty-identity theory, the findings from a study with a sample of adult Australian consumers show that people who want to reduce uncertainty about their sense of self respond favourably to a genealogical product that offers insight into a person's ancestry. Finding support the proposition that the need for closure moderates this effect. Consumers who are high in need for closure respond to self-uncertainty through an interest in commercial genealogical products. The study results show that curiosity underlies the effects in several ways; the desire to gain new knowledge about self, a curiosity to understand the past and the desire to reduce self-uncertainty about the past. Research implications for the study of consumer self-identity and uncertainty are presented, how consumers respond to this through the use of genealogical products examined. Managerial implications for the marketing of genealogical products are discussed, and recommendations for future research made.

1234,Substrate channelling: Nature's own tunnels,"The fascinating process of channelling of metabolic intermediates through enzymes is discussed in this article. Often, the active sites of two enzymes that catalyse sequential reactions in a metabolic pathway are connected through an intra-molecular 'void' - a sort of tunnel, lined by amino acids through which intermediates pass. Synergy between the subunits leads to a phenomenal increase in the overall rate of catalysis. There are enzymes with a single channel, some with multiple channels and some without any discrete channel/s, yet achieving high catalytic rates.

1235,Applied Research and the Transformation of College Education,"Like everything else today, there is a changing pattern in education. Some obvious elements are education's social function, demographics, and technology. A fourth dimension is being added to function, audience, and technique, and that is research. Research is also being reorganized, and now it is becoming an issue in the colleges. When, for example, the United States Congress banned the use of federal funds for research in political science unless the project could be shown to enhance ""homeland security"" or to protect American economic interests abroad, it was deemed a short-lived but nonetheless frightening aberration. Now, however, it is commonplace to find that a condition for research funding is that a project must prove itself in terms of commercialization. Because it is largely funded by private sector companies, research is expected to provide a material payoff--such as a new product or process that will find its value in the economic marketplace. In the alternative, academic research intended mainly to satisfy intellectual curiosity or to advance purely theoretical knowledge without thought to profit finds it difficult to locate a sponsor. Since most colleges were never interested in either scholarly or practical research, the issue of corporate-sponsored versus independent academic inquiry rarely surfaced. Now, however, some colleges are understandably tempted by the prospect of financial investment from private firms, nongovernmental agencies and the increasingly fashionable public-private partnerships. So, targeted ""applied"" research has produced a flurry of activity. Since government funds have shriveled and student fees are reaching a breaking point, the advantages of industry funding are too attractive to ignore. Howard Doughty writes here that ""The College Quarterly"" is sensitive to the legitimate educational concerns that have arisen in response to the new ethical and academic ambiguities inherent in the current enthusiasm for applied research projects and also to the socially useful consequences that such projects may bring. Although the funding possibilities are important, a strong case can also be made for the educational value to students and the end product economic value of a student-centred research experience. In this article, Doughty indicates that ""College Quarterly"" hopes that engaged educators will be willing to share their experiences, submit examples of applied projects either as research papers in themselves or as commentary on the ways that applied research relates to the pattern of transformation reflected in the social function, demographics, and technology of college education.","Doughty, Howard A",0,,895
1236,Leadership in a small town,"Of all the questions that might be asked about political life, it would be difficult to find one of greater interest than the ancient query: Who rules over whom?

Is it a single powerful individual, an economic elite, a series of elites, the citizens, political bosses, or some variant of these possibilities?The major purpose of this volume is to find an answer to this question for a small American city, and to extend the answer through relevant theory to American cities in general. But much more precisely, answers are sought for these interrelated questions: What are the relationships between the rulers and the ruled? How are the rulers related to each other? Are the rulers the same for all policies or do they differ from one area of policy to another? How do leaders arise, and in what way are they different from other people?The issues discussed in this volume are familiar to many towns. They range from controversies about the building of a new water system to housing and zoning codes, from charity appeals to low-income housing, from nominations and elections to industrial development and off-street parking. Wildavsky draws parallels to other community studies and formulates general propositions in support of his thesis that American communities are pluralist. And ultimately, Wildavsky is optimistic that small towns foster citizen participation, giving the population more of a chance to direct its own future.Aaron Wildavsky was, until his death in 1993, professor of political science and public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, and, while working on the present study, taught at Oberlin College.

1239,Translatable Research Group-Based Undergraduate Research Program for Lower-Division Students,"Participating in undergraduate research yields positive outcomes for undergraduate students, and universities are seeking ways to engage more students in undergraduate research earlier in their academic careers. Typically, undergraduate students perform research either as part of an apprenticeship where a student receives individual mentorship in a research lab setting from an experienced researcher in the field of interest or in a course-based undergraduate research experience where students work in a classroom or teaching laboratory to investigate open-ended research questions. In this work, we implement a model of undergraduate research that combines aspects of those two methods to provide benefits to undergraduate students and research groups. A cohort of 20 first-year undergraduate students at the University of California-Berkeley were recruited to work on a project investigating data previously collected by the Alivisatos research group. Over a semester, these students learned about nanomaterials and the research process, pursued curiosity-driven research in teams, and presented their results at a formal poster session. Students from this program showed quantifiable gains in their self-identification as researchers and scientists. This program was developed to be a model for other research groups, departments, and universities to combine the benefits of traditional apprenticeship research and course-based undergraduate research to provide a research experience for large numbers of undergraduate students early in their college education. <c2><a9> 2019 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.","Hauwiller, M R and Ondry, J C and Calvin, J J and Baranger, A M and Alivisatos, A P",0,10.1021/acs.jchemed.9b00159,898

1243,Basic questions,"This paper argues that a set of questioning attitudes are among the foundations of human and animal minds. While both verbal questioning and states of curiosity are generally explained in terms of metacognitive desires for knowledge or true belief, I argue (following Whitcomb and Friedman) that each is better explained by a prelinguistic sui generis type of mental attitude of questioning. I review a range of considerations in support of such a proposal and improve on previous characterizations of the nature of these attitudes. I then broaden their explanatory scope to include a number of forms of exploratory search. The paper has three main goals: (a) to characterize the nature of the questioning attitudes, outlining their causal role and type of content; (b) to argue that they are fundamental components of the mind, being widespread among animals and not constructed during ontogeny out of other attitudes; and (c) to suggest that they explain a great deal more behavior (among both humans and animals) than one might think.","Carruthers, Peter",0,10.1111/mila.12167,900

The fact that success rates are notably low in international assessments demonstrates the necessity to adopt ``different'' approaches apart from the existing learning and teaching methods. From this point of view, a mobile science laboratory (MSL) was constructed to deliver outreach activities in the rural outskirts of a city in Turkey. Experimental activities were carried out in this laboratory for six months with 324 middle school students who responded to survey questions. The research was designed with multimethod: A combination of quantitative and qualitative data-collection strategies was used. The first part has 25 five-point closed-ended Likert-scale items, and the second part has two open-ended questions. The results of the study show that the students in the rural areas were pleased with the activities; they enjoyed learning science in the MSL, and their interest and curiosity for science contents increased. It will be suggested that the MSLs should be used in order to support the science literacy of students in the rural areas of Turkey.","Erol, Mustafa and Buyuk, Ugur and Onal, Nagihan Tanik",0,10.12738/estp.2016.1.0171,901
1246,"Medical and Psychology Student's Experiences in Learning Mindfulness: Benefits, Paradoxes, and Pitfalls","Mindfulness has attracted increased interest in the field of health professionals' education due to its proposed double benefit of providing self-help strategies to counter stress and burnout symptoms and cultivating attitudes central to the role of professional helpers. The current study explored the experiential aspects of learning mindfulness. Specifically, we explored how first-year medical and psychology students experienced and conceptualized mindfulness upon completion of a 7-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program. Twenty-two students participated in either two focus group interviews or ten in-depth interviews, and we performed an interpretive phenomenological analysis of the interview transcripts. All students reported increased attention and awareness of psychological and bodily phenomena. The majority also reported a shift in their attitudes towards their experiences in terms of decreased reactivity, increased curiosity, affect tolerance, patience and self-acceptance, and improved relational qualities. The experience of mindfulness was mediated by subjective intention and the interpretation of mindfulness training. The attentional elements of mindfulness were easier to grasp than the attitudinal ones, in particular with respect to the complex and inherently paradoxical elements of non-striving and radical acceptance. Some participants considered mindfulness as a means to more efficient instrumental task-oriented coping, whilst others reported increased sensitivity and tolerance towards their own state of mind. A broader range of program benefits appeared dependent upon embracing the paradoxes and integrating attitudinal elements in practising mindfulness. Ways in which culture and context may influence the experiences in learning mindfulness are discussed along with practical, conceptual, and research implications.","Solhaug, Ida and Eriksen, Thor E and de Vibe, Michael and Haavind, Hanne and Friborg, Oddgeir and Sorlie, Tore and Rosenvinge, Jan H",0,10.1007/s12671-016-0521-0,902
1247,Cognitive conflict and situational interest as factors influencing conceptual change,"In this study, we investigated the relationships among cognitive conflict and situational interest induced by a discrepant event, attention and effort allocated to learning, and conceptual change in learning the concept of density. Subjects were 183 seventh graders from six middle schools in Seoul, Korea. A preconception test, a test of responses to a discrepant event, and a questionnaire of situational interest were administered as pretests. Computer-assisted instruction was then provided to the students as a conceptual change intervention. Questionnaires regarding attention and effort, and a conception test were administered as posttests. The conception test was administered once more as a retention test four weeks later. The results of path analysis indicated that both cognitive conflict and situational interest induced by a discrepant event respectively had an indirect effect on students' conceptual understanding, which were mediated by attention and effort allocated to concept learning. Situational interest, however, was found to exert a stronger influence on conceptual change than cognitive conflict. It was also found that attention, either directly or indirectly through effort, influenced students' conceptual understanding.

1249,Choosing where to look next in a mutation sequence space: Active Learning of informative p53 cancer rescue mutants,"Motivation: Many biomedical projects would benefit from reducing the time and expense of in vitro experimentation by using computer models for in silico predictions. These models may help determine which expensive biological data are most useful to acquire next. Active Learning techniques for choosing the most informative data enable biologists and computer scientists to optimize experimental data choices for rapid discovery of biological function. To explore design choices that affect this desirable behavior, five novel and five existing Active Learning techniques, together with three control methods, were tested on 57 previously unknown p53 cancer rescue mutants for their ability to build classifiers that predict protein function. The best of these techniques, Maximum Curiosity, improved the baseline accuracy of 56-77%.

1250,While Curiosity Killed the Cat...Wasn't It Satisfaction That Brought It Back?--EAPQuest as a Modified Version of WebQuest in the Context of University Teaching,"The Internet provides a powerful digital learning environment for language acquisition and noticing. Thus implementation of challenging tasks to be solved by exploring the Web may sound appealing. The primary idea of the WebQuest project emphasizes data collection. The idea of the TalenQuest, however, goes beyond this traditional concept so as to draw on the richness of both ELT materials and authentic resources in terms of the target language. Consequently, TalenQuest activities may constitute effective SLA activities. Doing a web-based second language research should therefore result in enhancing one's language areas and developing language skills. Taking all the possible advantages which may derive from taking part in a TalenQuest project into account, the implementation of this activity format in university contexts seems justified. There is a need, nevertheless, to customize the idea of TalenQuest for academic language learning specifically. Such an activity format, the EAPQuest, may have educational and motivational value especially when learners are confronted with tasks they find challenging. Writing an academic essay definitely matches the description. The aim of the article is therefore to present the concept of the EAPQuest as a motivating tool to train web-related language skills. Furthermore, an EAPQuest is sketched so as to illustrate a sample procedure. This may serve as a stimulus for designing materials and applying similar procedures into one's own learning environment.","Burzynska, Kamila",0,,905

The research team collaborated with practitioners to deliver a programme of activities aimed at encouraging parents' confidence in their own ability to support emergent scientific thinking among their young children. The programme generated children's engagement and interest. Parents and practitioners reported increased confidence in their ability to promote young children's natural curiosity at home and in early childhood provision. The authors see no reason for positing qualitative differences between the way children acquire scientific and other concepts in their earliest years.","Lloyd, Eva and Edmonds, Casey and Downs, Celony and Crutchley Rebecca and and Paffard, Fran",0,10.1080/03004430.2016.1226355,906

1256,A Curious Learning Companion in Virtual Learning Environment,"The open space characteristic and the lack of a strict script in the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) often pose the learners in a state of confusion or being lost. This phenomenon adversely affects the learning outcomes. Curious learning companions, who detect interesting learning objects tailored to the learner's current level of knowledge, can unobtrusively prevent them from experiencing such confusion. Hence, we present a comprehensive computational model of curiosity based on the psychological theory by Berlyne. For modeling the complex relationships between curiosity stimulating factors, we employ Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM). To test our model's effectiveness, we implement it into a learning companion and conduct two case studies. These case studies demonstrate our model's consistency with the underlying theories, and a small scale field study proves our hypothesis that curious learning companions can help the learners to explore more knowledge in the VLE.","Wu, Q and Miao, C and Shen, Z",0,,908

Using Family History to Provoke Rigorous Enquiry","The idea of using ""little stories"" to illuminate the ""big pictures"" of the past was creatively explored in ""Teaching History 107,"" which offered teachers a wealth of detailed vignettes with which to kindle young people's interest and illuminate major historical events. Paul Barrett builds on the ideas explored in that issue in two important ways. The first is to locate the little stories that are studied within children's own families, encouraging his students to explore records and share the war-time experiences of their relatives. The annual event which his school hosts for the grandparents of Year 7 students offers an inspirational example of the curiosity and enthusiasm generated by personal history. Barrett's second contribution, carefully developed through the sequence of lessons that he outlines here, is to make such personal stories an integral part of a rigorous historical enquiry, thereby expanding students' conceptions of historical diversity and alerting them to the contingent nature of historical significance.

A number of important employer assumptions derivative of the themes are also discussed in relation to social network user on and offline identities. In terms of theoretical contributions, our findings expand conceptions of employee branding, contest the freedom affiliated with virtual identity, and create a new form of digital divide.

1264,"Content analysis of the use of fantasy, challenge, and curiosity in school-based nutrition education programs","The objective of this research was to document the extent to which elements of fantasy, curiosity, and challenge are used in existing nutrition education materials. A content analysis of 30 nutrition education curricula designed for elementary and middle-school grades was conducted. Print curricula, computer software, videotapes, and puppet shows were included in the sample. The use of challenge, curiosity, and fantasy, as defined in the Theory of Intrinsically Motivating Instruction (TIMI), was assessed in each curriculum. Approximately half of the curricula included elements of challenge, curiosity or fantasy. All of the nonprint curricula and 30% of the print curricula incorporated these characteristics. Curiosity was most frequently used in these curricula, followed by fantasy and then challenge. The TIMI provided a useful theory to examine the instructional approaches frequently used in school-based nutrition education programs. Nutritionists may apply concepts from the TIMI to the design of future curricula so that these programs are interesting and entertaining for their target audience.","Matheson, D and Spranger, K",0,10.1016/S1499-4046(06)60004-3,912
1266,"""Why Are They Bombing Innocent Iraqis?"": Political Literacy among Primary Pupils","This article presents case studies of political literacy among primary pupils. While researching primary pupils' understanding of ""enterprise"", the researchers added interviews connecting this concept to the Iraq war. A sample of 10 non-representative Scottish primary schools from seven local education authorities has provided the setting for specific case studies. The schools are located within a range of inner-city, town and rural settings and with a variety of socio-economic backgrounds. In each case study class, pupils from either primary 6 or primary 7 were asked to draw an ""enterprising person"" and note the qualities of someone who is enterprising. Follow-up discussion groups allowed pupils to share their ideas, justify their choices and expand upon their perceptions of enterprising values. This use of informal discussions with pupils enabled the researchers to evaluate the extent to which children's perceptions of enterprise may reflect individualistic or communitarian values, and whether they are politically literate in relation to local and global affairs. Through their initial drawings, written comments and follow-up discussions, it was found that the main qualities that pupils associated with enterprise could be defined as the need to be brave, confident, prepared to take risks and the ability to be a good leader. They also felt it should encompass a certain degree of responsible and caring behaviour and values. The use of interactive sessions on international news issues provided a neat setting for these pupils to share their curiosity, interest and personal opinions and also for the teacher to address some particular misunderstandings. The ""eyes closed"" methodology ensured greater autonomy in expressing opinions.","Maitles, Henry and Deuchar, Ross",0,,913
1268,INTERACTIVE SCIENCE DEVICES: CURIOSITY AND INFLUENCE ON SCIENCE,"The use of this kind of interactive devices in science classes can have a positive effect on the science performance of students. These assertions stem from a study of the ideas of secondary school students who were asked, through a questionnaire, to give their views immediately after they have been exposed to interactive science devices. All students, whether they planned to take STEM track or not, were `greatly curious' about the interactive science devices and perceived that the use of Interactive science devices in their science classes `greatly influenced' their science performance. Compared to the other group, those who planned to take STEM track were significantly more interested with the interactive science devices, as expected. It is recommended that ways to introduce interactive science devices to high school students, such as science fairs and exhibits, be done in order to attract students to pursue STEM track in their high school senior years. Also, high school teachers are encouraged to utilize interactive science devices in their science classes so that the academic performance of their students can be enhanced.","Dolipas, Bretel B and Lubrica, Joel V and Ramos, Jennifer Lyn S and Abiasen, Jovalson T",0,,914

1270,Addressing indigenous australian social exclusion: A strategic praxis approach to research and the provision of social services,"Indigenous Australians have been the object of much academic interest since Anglo-Europeans first came into contact with them and they have become the subjects of intense research - prompting claims that they are the most researched peoples in the world. Early research portrayed Indigenous Australians as subhuman, bereft of technology, organized social systems, codes of law and any trappings of civilization. The initial focus upon Indigenous Australians was to civilise them and bring them into the 'brotherhood of man' through science and religion, although it was not expected that they would participate equally. They were considered to be unevolved. Aboriginal ('original man'), without the developed mental capacities to take full advantage of the benefits of civilisation and thus for much of the past two centuries they were denied it. During the early twentieth century they became the focus of academic curiosity seeking to juxtapose (and justify) Western civilised social structures with those of 'stone-age' primitive cultures. Since the advent of the 'civil rights' movements of the 1950's and 1960's much of the research has centred upon addressing Indigenous Australian social disadvantage. While Indigenous Australians enjoy many of the benefits that Western civilisation has provided, centuries of research and academic endeavour have done little more than entrench notions of their inability to engage and take advantage of the social benefits on offer in Australia. Prior to Anglo-European contact and domination. Indigenous Australians had developed a complex social system that was sufficient for their needs and consistent with their hfestyle and behefs. At the time of the arrival of Anglo-Europeans they enjoyed greater life expectancy than their counterparts from Europe. They had better health outcomes, almost unlimited access to their lands and thus to nutritious foods and through the kinship system experienced social support structures that defined not only their societal roles, obligations and responsibilities, but also confirmed their social and spiritual identity. Over a period of some two hundred years the situation has changed markedly for Indigenous Australians. Their access to their lands and their rights to its bounty have been denied through imposed European laws that failed to recognise Indigenous ownership, their populations have been decimated through introduced disease and maltreatment and they have been largely excluded from the benefits of the social system that replaced their own. Until 1967 Indigenous Australians did not have citizenship rights in their own land and were denied equality of opportunity to participate in and share in the wealth generated from their plundered resources. To facilitate this plunder they were removed to church run missions and state run reserves where their every action was governed by an alien system of rules and conventions that in many instances extinguished the former social support structures that had sustained them for more than 40,000 years. Many were forced to work in menial employment for low wages or where their wages were paid to the state to be kept in trust for them only to see their money stolen by the very apparatus that was supposed to protect it - the state. Despite now having citizenship Indigenous Australians have benefited little. They currently fare worse that Anglo- European Australians on just about every indicator. They have shorter life expectancy, poorer health outcomes, are more likely to be incarcerated for minor offences, experience higher rates of unemployment, have less disposable income, are more likely to live in overcrowded substandard housing, and are less likely to achieve educational standards comparable with Anglo-European Australians. For this Indigenous Australians deserve redress and just compensation. Anglo-European Australians have a moral and ethical duty to right the wrongs of the past and address the current inequality. However, while most Australians are supportive of Indigenous Australians being treated fairly and achieving equality of outcomes they have been largely excluded from the benefits conferred by membership to Anglo-European Australia and its social structures. The 'safety net' of social support systems and structures that have been developed to ameliorate disadvantage for all Australians has failed Indigenous Australians - the most socially disadvantaged group of Australians. This chapter examines the Indigenous Australian social context, explores the issues and suggests ways to address current approaches that have done little more than entrench the disadvantage experienced by Indigenous Australians. <c2><a9> 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Morgan, D",0,10.1007/0-387-27589-4_14,916
1271,Shaking the foundations: On the moral economy of criminal justice,"During the last three decades, criminal justice, in England and Wales, has been subjected to ethico-cultural disturbances. Fiscal realignments, punitive and bureaucratic expansion, reducing cultural divides between probation and prison, and the diminution of psychosocial curiosity are some of the features which have eroded the concept of moral economy. There are also pressing threats and dangers, during 2010-15, as the criminal justice system is embedded within a new material platform through deeper integration into the circuits of capital accumulation and market expansion. This article advances an intellectual case for reanimating the lineaments of moral economy through dialectical contestation, to renew interest in justice, truth and fairness, by forging links between Judaeo-Christian ethics and Continental philosophy.

1272,The inner struggle of visiting â€˜dark tourismâ€™ sites: examining the relationship between perceived constraints and motivations,"Numerous conflicting factors impact the tourism decision process especially as it relates to dark tourism, that is, tourism that focuses on mortality. This research examines the relationships among constraints and motivational factors that affect tourists<e2><80><99> decision to visit the Memorial of the Victims of the Nanjing Massacre in China. Seven dimensions of constraints were revealed with the most important factor being an interest in other leisure activities. Of the three motivational factors discovered, the obligation the respondents feel to visit the site was discovered to be the most important. The major contribution of this research is its analysis of the relationship between motivations and constraints and the discovery that there are both positive and negative relationships between constraint and motivation factors. The most important finding may be that an increase in curiosity motivation may result in a decrease in disinterest constraints but an increase in the strength of the constraint of Chinese cultural perspectives on death and taboos. The findings suggest that the most effective marketing might not focus too much on the development of curiosity but on other motives, such as obligation and education. <c2><a9> 2016, <c2><a9> 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Zheng, C and Zhang, J and Qian, L and Jurowski, C and Zhang, H and Yan, B",0,10.1080/13683500.2016.1220512,918
1273,Introduction: Doctoral education in transition,"Our introductory chapter explores the importance of applied interdisciplinary research to professional doctorate studies. We discuss the theoretical and epistemological issues that seem rather unique to applied research in the workplace in addition to the practical issues faced by students. We provide a theoretical and policy framework for the research that typifies our program and introduce the chapters that form the soul of our book. In particular we will show how case studies can illustrate how applied doctoral research meets the ideal of melding professional and academic interests in a research-based degree program. The case studies illustrate several foundational issues that frame a successful program including: (a) the importance of a well-founded epistemological framework that explains and defends a particular ""way of knowing<e2><80><9d> incorporating culture and ethnicity-based knowledge systems; (b) the importance of maintaining an approach to research that is curiosity-driven despite the demands from organizations for targeted research; (c) the need to develop a writing style that meets the demands and audience requirements of policy and academic interests as well as the general public; and (d) the significance of developing a research program that extends well beyond the time frame of the doctoral program. In the end, we discuss how our program has advanced our understanding of scholar-practitioner-based doctoral research, and, importantly, we discuss the long-term implications for a foundational reform of doctoral research, in general. We based these final discussions on experience within our program and on awareness of the demands from the changing worlds of work and education. <c2><a9> The Author(s) 2018.","Pulla, S and Schissel, B",0,10.1007/978-3-319-64453-0_1,919
1275,Tests of the Aharonov-Bohm effect,"The Aharonov-Bohm effect was first proposed in 1959, and has stimulated discussion and controversy since the start. Seen by many as a purely quantum mechanical effect, it nevertheless involves such issues as gauge invariance and relativistic dynamics. This multi-faceted nature has led it to be considered a keystone of modern quantum theory. Over the past half-century, interest has remained strong in what many believe is still an open debate as to the purely quantum nature. Additionally, discovery of similar effects for particles other than electrons has further driven curiosity. To better understand the issues such as electromagnetic mass and relativistic effects involved in the Aharonov-Bohm effect, a theoretical study of a simpler two particle system was done. The goal was to understand the manner in which mass of the system behaved strictly classically as compared to a relativistically. As a result of this, a Gedanken experiment is presented which serves as a test for covariance. The two particle system was extended to a spherical shell interacting with a single particle, and a second thought experiment put forth to explore a coupling between electromagnetism and gravitation. In the course of searching for simpler systems which involved the same issues as the Aharonov-Bohm effect, a system presented in the Feynman Lectures of Physics was found to be appropriate. We conduct a complete relativistic analysis of this system as a step towards a full relativistic analysis of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. Given the history and significance of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, it is perhaps surprising that relevant experimental tests had not been completed. For the first time, we searched for time delays as an electron passes a macroscopic solenoid. Such time delays are characteristic of classical forces acting on the electron. No such delays were found, seemingly confirming the standard viewpoint. It is still possible a classical explanation may exist for microscopic solenoids, though our experiment has served to place an upper limit for any such explanation. The definitive experiment concerning the Aharonov-Bohm Effect has yet to be completed. Proposed by Zeilinger, it consists of showing the dispersionless nature of the effect. To accomplish this requires an electron interferometer capable of enclosing a larger area and operating at lower energies than any which currently exist. We are attempting to construct such an interferometer using a hybrid approach with a nanofabricated grating and electron bi-prism. We have shown that experimentally that this combination can produce a large beam separation and still retain sufficient coherence to function as an interferometer.","Caprez, Adam Preston",0,,920
1276,Part of a Manâ€™s World: A Modern Feminist and Musical Perspective on The Little Mermaid</em>,"Since the release of Snow White in 1937, Disney princesses have become global icons who influence and inspire generations. The Little Mermaid (1989) contains one of the most notable of the Disney Princesses, the mermaid Ariel whose rebellious nature enticed audiences beginning the Disney Renaissance Age. Before its release Disney was on the brink of bankruptcy, however due to The Little Mermaid<e2><80><99>s success the company was ultimately saved with the protagonist Ariel making a name for herself as the new mold for future princesses. Ariel<e2><80><99>s adventurous spirit and comparative independence marked a change from the demure Disney Princesses who preceded her. Although these princesses are fictional characters, their empowering message uplifts through inspirational song and evocative interaction. The Little Mermaid is a coming of age story about a young mermaid named Ariel who dreams of being a part of the human world, which is forbidden by her father King Triton. Ariel strikes a deal with the sea witch and in doing so obtains human legs for three days in exchange for her voice. Critics of the Disney princess franchise have disregarded Ariel<e2><80><99>s interest in the human world as selfish and childish. However, they seem to forget that Ariel is not a fully formed adult, but rather a young heroine of sixteen with a complex intertwining of juvenile and adult attributes that is commonly found in someone her age. Ariel shows her extroverted nature and depth of character through her signature song, <e2><80><9c>Part of Your World,<e2><80><9d> whose popularity ushered in a new era of self-reliant princesses. Written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman, <e2><80><9c>Part of Your World<e2><80><9d> displays Ariel<e2><80><99>s curiosity about the human world.

Not all of her conversations with her students lead to the kinds of questions that leave her speechless or sleepless. Some conversations are purely silly, some are ethical debates, some are just brief speculations on a small, but significant topic of interest. Occasionally it is not even a conversation that transforms her classroom into some mystical place; it is just a moment or a mood that appears out of nowhere and disappears immediately unless noticed. Yet all of these occurrences are essential to the kind of classroom she wants to create for the children--the kind of classroom where the paths they travel are sometimes hers and sometimes theirs, where their curiosity is given as much space as it needs, as much air as they need for their exploration of the world to survive. Creating this environment for the children also means sometimes accepting that she will not be able to follow all the startling twists and bends of their seemingly illogical logic or that when she does finally figure out what they are saying, the conversation may be long finished and forgotten. In this article, she illustrates this with an experience she had in her 1st grade classroom.","Ehrenfeld, Jane",0,,922

1281,Online communities as a catalyst for creativity in the english primary context,"Networking learners through the establishment of online communities puts at their disposal a myriad of resources; human and electronic. Children can access a range of e-tools to author their own multimodal texts, exchange ideas and share their creations with other learners locally and around the globe. However, being able to access such resources beyond the boundaries of the school raises a series of pedagogical issues concerning curriculum, control and learner-centred education. This paper will address these central issues and offer a view of ICT in education that focuses upon teaching for creativity with ICT, drawing upon current theories of creativity offered by Claxton 1999, Craft, Jeffrey and Leibling, 2001, and Loveless 2002. The paper is based upon a research study carried out in two English Primary Schools with children aged ten and eleven years. Children's interactions and activities within an online community were monitored and analysed over a period of twelve months. Interviews were carried out with the children to explore the motivation and thinking behind their online actions and interactions. The children's teachers were interviewed in order to understand how they viewed the children's online activities. The findings of the project raise key questions regarding the role of the teacher, the challenges they face in facilitating children's learning through online communities and the nature and quality of that learning. It is clear that the use of an online community as a teaching and learning tool demands a different range of pedagogical skills and techniques from those that often prevail amongst the teaching profession. Similarly, the type of learning that online communities may yield, I will argue, is one that is based upon a deep understanding of what it means to both be a learner, and to take responsibility for one's learning.

1282,Transgender female-to-males (FTMS) whose primary sexual attractions shifted from women to men with transition: An interpretative phenomenological analysis,"This study looked at the experiences of FTMs whose primary sexual attraction shifted from women to men with transition. Seven participants were interviewed in an open-ended format, and interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to analyze the results. Inclusion criteria required participants to be between 25-45 years of age, be taking testosterone for five years or more, be primarily attracted to women before transition and primarily attracted to men after transition, and be living full time as men. Participants ranged in age from 25-39. Three participants identified as White/Caucasian; two as Jewish, one as White/Mexican, and one as Black. Four lived in urban areas, three in suburban. Six of the seven lived in the San Francisco Bay Area at the time of the interviews. The participants were highly educated. Three participants identified their current sexual orientation as queer, one as queer/bisexual, one as bisexual, one as gay, and one as ""I like hot people."" Analyses revealed eight major themes: queer identity is central to self, aversion to traditional gender roles in relationship, attraction to sameness, interest/curiosity around how cismen's (men who identify with the gender they were assigned at birth) bodies work, increased openness to different experiences after transition, comfort and safety as key to sexual relationships, acceptance of trans identity brought about acceptance of attraction to men, and delayed addressing attraction to men until after transition. Minor themes included: more opportunity to have sex with men, insecurity about one's body, and butch women less sexually available to men. Most themes confirmed past research findings, but some themes identified new reasons for this change in sexual attraction. Average number of years post-transition for attraction change was less for participants in this study versus prior studies. Attraction to sameness, more opportunity to have sex with men, and increased openness to different experiences after transition were new themes that emerged. Another new theme included comfort and safety as key to sexual relationships. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed.

Since several of the respondents mentioned a combination of factors, the classification is only heuristic. According to the author, from the replies, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the personal values and needs of some psychologists led to their study of the Negro.

1284,The scientific intellectual: The psychological & sociological origins of modern science,"In ""The Scientific Intellectual,"" Lewis S. Feuer traces the evolution of this new human type, seeking to define what ethic inspired him and the underlying emotions that created him. Under the influence of Max Weber, the rise of the scientific spirit has been viewed by sociologists as an offspring of the Protestant revolution, with its asceticism and sense of guilt acting as causative agents in the rise of capitalism and the growth of the scientific movement. Feuer takes strong issue with this view, pointing out how it is at odds with what we know of the psychological conditions of modern societies making for human curiosity and its expression in the observation of and experiment with nature. Feuer shows that wherever a scientific movement has begun, it has been based on emotions that issue in what might be called a hedonist-libertarian ethic. The scientific intellectual was a person for whom science was a ""new philosophy,"" third force rising above religious and political hatreds, seeking in the world of nature liberated vision, a intending to use and enjoy knowledge. . . .

1285,"The 'long march' of women and sport in mainland China: Revolution, resistance and resilience","At the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games, China placed second overall in the medal count, behind the USA, and it is well acknowledged that Chinese women have made the greatest contribution to China's meteoric rise in international sport. In fact, at the last seven Summer Olympics since 1988, Chinese women won more gold medals than their male counterparts. Their extraordinary performances have sparked considerable global interest as journalists from around the world have lavished stories on Chinese elite women athletes. In spite of an increased academic curiosity of Chinese women and sport, however, there remains a paucity of analytical literature, especially about elite women's sport, and a dearth of high-quality monographs in particular. Very few indeed are written in English. The situation outlined above raises questions: What factors have contributed to the success of Chinese female athletes? How has the national identity of China been constructed through the pursuit of sporting victories? What part have Chinese sportswomen played in boosting China's new image in the world? What is the relationship between national identity, sport and gender in China? To answer these interlocking questions, it is necessary to scrutinize the political, economic, social, cultural and aesthetic relationships between globalization, market economy, traditional gender norms, and modern sporting culture for women in China.

1289,Effects of performance expectancy and outcome certainty on interest in social comparison,"Preferences for social comparison information were studied by observing how much Ss explored a distribution of others' test scores and how they made inferences from this distribution. It was hypothesized that Ss would be more interested in exploring this distribution in a Partial Information Condition (when they were given their own performance score but no evaluation of this score) than in a No Information or a Full Information Condition. It was also hypothesized that having a need for self-enhancement or dissonance reduction aroused by receiving a low score or an unexpected score would stimulate exploration of this distribution. Ninety-three students sampled the distribution of exam scores obtained by members of their class and tried to estimate the class average.

1291,"Developing Children's Creativity, Thinking, and Interests. Strategies for the District, School, and Classroom","To foster individual development, educators must seek the gifts in every child, in those not demonstrating academic abilities as well as in the most brilliant. Instead of stifling thinking, creativity, and interest development, educators must encourage these behaviors. Currently, a big discrepancy exists between the child's potential and what schools actually value or stimulate. This bulletin first examines some barriers to developing children's creativity, thinking, and interests, such as low self-concept, lack of training opportunities, testing for facts instead of relationships, fragmented curricula, short-term views on course content, and negative attitudes toward creativity. Chapter 2 discusses the meaning of creativity and explores whether it should be nurtured in all children or only in the gifted and talented through a continuum of creative behaviors. Chapter 3 looks at ways to support cognitive development and the relationship between thinking and creativity. Chapter 4 treats the importance of interests in the child's learning and development and discusses types of interests, how they are structured, and the relation of interests to creativity. The final two chapters discuss practical strategies for supporting creativity, thinking, and interests at the district, school, and classroom levels. To produce Renaissance or visionary men and women will require a reexamination of play, interest development, self-regulation, and autonomy in early creative development. Included are 7 figures and 146 references. (MLH)","Cohen, Leonora M and Oregon School Study Council, Eugene.",0,,931
1292,ST product characteristics and relationships with perceptions and behaviors among rural adolescent males: a qualitative study,"Although smoking declines in the United States, the prevalence of male adolescent smokeless tobacco (ST; moist snuff and chewing tobacco) use remains unchanged. ST product characteristics, such as flavoring, packaging, and branding, could influence adolescents' ST initiation and continued use. This qualitative study examines the potential role of product characteristics in shaping ST-related perceptions and behaviors among rural adolescent males. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted at three California rural high schools. ST users were asked about their experiences and perceptions related to product characteristics. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using a general inductive approach. Participants associated flavored ST with appealing non-tobacco products, such as chewing gum and alcohol. Availability of different varieties and flavors stimulated interest and curiosity in sampling or switching between ST products. Time-limited promotional flavors and packaging also enhanced product appeal. Adolescent ST users preferred certain brands based on perceived brand features and perceived nicotine content, associating higher-strength brands as better suited for experienced ST users. Brand preferences frequently reflected perceived ST brand popularity within peer groups. Based on these observations, potential ST regulation and health education campaigns to address misconceptions about ST characteristics could influence adolescents' ST-related perceptions and reduce ST use among this vulnerable population.","Couch, Elizabeth T and Darius, Ellen F and Walsh, Margaret M and Chaffee, Benjamin W",0,10.1093/her/cyx067,932

Russian pilgrims' narratives contributed in Russia towards knowledge about the Middle East from the pre-modern era when they were a major source of information about the area. From the sixteenth century, the scope of the pilgrims' interest became wider and more versatile. Nearly all Russian pilgrims who left written travel accounts concentrated not only on the customary phenomena related to pilgrimage but they also paid tribute, albeit in various degrees, to secular issues. Pilgrims' writings appealed to all strata of Russian society as ""edifying reading"" about the Holy Land and as entertaining reading aimed at stirring readers' curiosity about the alien world outside their homeland's boundaries. This literature contributed in Russia towards the formation of the image of the Orient: pilgrims eagerly supplied readers with first-hand evidence about the realia of the Arab-Ottoman world and they also proliferated Orientalist myths and stereotypes. <c2><a9> 2012 Oriental Institute (ASCR), Prague.","Kirillina, S",0,,936
1297,Using NASA science news articles to enhance learning in the classroom,"In this author's experience, students of introductory physics and physical science courses are often under-confident of their ability to master physics concepts, many of them believing they simply cannot ""get physics,"" however hard they might work at it. In addition, they have an impression that physics is not only dry and boring but also static (they do, after all, spend much of their time on the discoveries of Galileo and Newton in physics class). Since they are unlikely to read popular science articles in the media, they tend to be unaware of cutting-edge research in the physical sciences that might, for good or ill, transform their lives. This paper describes an innovative use of articles from NASA's Science News website, and similar Internet resources that can potentially address the issue of student confidence while increasing science literacy and interest. The approach is inspired by the work of educational psychologist Carol Dweck and her research on ""fixed"" versus ""growth"" mindsets. I believe it is necessary for instructors to understand her work if we are to increase student comprehension, interest, and curiosity in the physical sciences.","Singh, V",0,10.1119/1.3651728,937
1298,Musicality: Communicating the vitality and interests of life,"Four decades ago scientific interest began to focus on a new theory of how human will and emotion are immediately shareable with others through gestures of the body and voice. The handful of researchers who contributed to this new way of looking at human nature, paediatricians, child psychiatrists, ethologists, anthropologists and social linguists, independently making observations of mothers and infants in natural, mutually enjoyable communication, considered the vitality of the communicative gestures themselves to be sufficient for the creation of memorable stories. From these beginnings comes the account of communicative musicality explored in this book. It will be clear that when discussing communicative musicality we are using the words 'musicality' and 'musical' in a very particular way. When we talk of the 'musicality' of mother-baby interaction, we are not talking of what we generally understand to be music, with its known composers and performers. Music is moulded by the forces of culture, such that a song from a rainforest tribe in Brazil will sound very different to a Beethoven symphony, which in turn will sound very different from the output of a composer such as Stockhausen. When we talk of musicality we are pointing to the innate human abilities that make music production and appreciation possible (Blacking 1969/1995). And not only music, also dance and any other human endeavour that could be considered one of the temporal arts, such as religious ceremonies or theatre-all instances of 'the human seriousness of play' (Turner 1982). We define musicality as expression of our human desire for cultural learning, our innate skill for moving, remembering and planning in sympathy with others that makes our appreciation and production of an endless variety of dramatic temporal narratives possible-whether those narratives consist of specific cultural forms of music, dance, poetry or ceremony; whether they are the universal narratives of a mother and her baby quietly conversing with one another; whether it is the wordless emotional and motivational narrative that sits beneath a conversation between two or more adults or between a teacher and a class. In the coordination of practical tasks, a shared, intuitively communicated understanding is necessary for success. It is our common musicality that makes it possible for us to share time meaningfully together, in its emotional richness and its structural holding, and for us to participate with anticipation and recollection of pleasure in the 'imitative arts' as explained by Adam Smith (1777/1982). This is the sense in which communicative musicality is explored by the authors of this volume. The companionship in discovery of the musical impulses in human beings has been an enjoyable and encouraging one, but the story is far from finished. Our scientific curiosity has faced us with two mysterious dichotomies that were familiar to Aristotle and a long line of his predecessors-the mind-body question, and the problem of sympathy. We believe humans move under the coordinated and integrated control of a time keeping, energy regulating Intrinsic Motive Pulse (IMP) (Trevarthen 1999). This book explores a particular way of thinking about how the human mind and human body work together and are intimately interdependent; it investigates how we share life and make the meaning of our culture in communities. It presents many kinds of evidence to support the view that we are evolved to know, think, communicate, create new things and care for one another in movement-through a sense of being in rhythmic time with motives and in tune with feelings to share the energy and harmony of meaning and of relating.

1299,Parental Influence on Child Career Development in Mainland China: A Qualitative Study,"Compared with adolescents and adults, there is little research that examines child career development and especially how parents might influence such development. This is especially true in Mainland China, where family life is highly valued. This study used interpretative phenomenological analysis to examine how Mainland Chinese parents influence the career development of their 5th-grade children. Six superordinate themes were identified from both the children's and the parents' perspectives: responding to career curiosity, influence on career gender stereotypes, emphasizing the importance of education, encouraging independent career decision making, providing opportunities for career interest development, and mothers as career role models. Suggestions are offered for future career development learning programs and research.","Liu, Jianwei and McMahon, Mary and Watson, Mark",0,10.1002/j.2161-0045.2015.00096.x,939
1300,The academic and nonacademic characteristics of science and nonscience majors in Yemeni high schools,"The purposes of this study were: (a) to identify the variables associated with selection of majors; (b) to determine the differences between science and nonscience majors in general, and high and low achievers in particular, with respect to attitudes toward science, integrated science process skills, and logical thinking abilities; and (c) to determine if a significant relationship exists between students' majors and their personality types and learning styles. Data were gathered from 188 twelfth grade male and female high school students in Yemen, who enrolled in science (45 males and 47 females) and art and literature (47 males and 49 females) tracks. Data were collected by the following instruments: Past math and science achievement (data source taken from school records), Kolb's Learning Styles Inventory (1985), Integrated Science Process Skills Test, Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, Attitude Toward Science in School Assessment, Group Assessment of Logical Thinking, Yemeni High School Students Questionnaire. The Logistic Regression Model and the Linear Discriminant Analysis identified several variables that are associated with selection of majors. Moreover, some of the characteristics of science and nonscience majors that were revealed by these models include the following: Science majors seem to have higher degrees of curiosity in science, high interest in science at high school level, high tendency to believe that their majors will help them to find a potential job in the future, and have had higher achievement in science subjects, and have rated their math teachers higher than did nonscience majors. In contrast, nonscience majors seem to have higher degrees of curiosity in nonscience subjects, higher interest in science at elementary school, higher anxiety during science lessons than did science majors. In addition, General Linear Models allow that science majors generally demonstrate more positive attitudes towards science than do nonscience majors and they outperform nonscience majors on integrated science process skills and logical thinking abilities. High achievers in science majors have a significantly higher attitude toward science, higher integrated science process skills, and higher logical thinking abilities than high and low achievers in nonscience majors. No gender differences were found on these variables. Chi-Square tests indicate that no significant relationships exist between students' majors and their personality types and learning styles. However, it was found that majority of students prefer extroversion over introversion, sensing over intuition, thinking over feeling, and judging over perceiving. Moreover, the most common learning styles among science and nonscience majors were the divergent and the assimilative learning styles. Finally, the educational implication of these findings were discussed and future research that need to be conducted were proposed.

1303,"The Harkness approach to teaching and learning: Teacher perceptions of a student-centered, discussion-based pedagogy","Purpose The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore how teacher participants describe the Harkness approach and the implications of the method on teachers and students. An in-depth exploration of the experiences of Harkness teacher participants investigated their individual perceptions of a student-centered, discussion-based pedagogy as it relates to student learning and teacher qualities. Methodology Using Moustakas' phenomenological design, a purposeful sampling technique was employed to select teacher participants for individual phone interviews and individual demographic questionnaires. Data were recorded, transcribed, analyzed, clustered, and synthesized. Findings Twelve themes emerged from the responses to the two research questions. Regarding Research Question 1: How do experienced Harkness teachers describe student learning in Harkness classrooms?; the following themes emerged: (a) active learning, (b) student responsibility, (c) gained perspectives, (d) utilizing complex content, (e) 21st-century skills, and (f) student voice. Regarding Research Question 2: What qualities do experienced Harkness teachers identify as necessary for teachers using the Harkness Method?; the following themes emerged: (a) genuine interest in what students are thinking, (b) teacher passion, (c) teacher expertise, (d) comfort with ambiguity and change, (e) undetermined course for discussion, and (f) genuine desire for greater student learning. Implications and Conclusions The underlying assumptions regarding the Harkness approach to teaching and learning are supported by constructivist learning theories, including social constructivism, collaborative approaches, and cooperative learning methods. Although many similarities exist between Harkness learning and the Socratic method, such as the impetus of academic discourse and thoughtful questioning, the distinguishing difference between the two discussion-based practices is Harkness' emphasis of studentcenteredness. Moreover, thought leaders and Harkness teachers have expressed the importance Harkness has on enlightening self-awareness, appreciating nuance, and developing humility (Boadi, 2015; Brownback, 2015; Foley, 2015). Skills that are deemed appropriate for developing in the 21 st-century student include: (a) critical thinking and problem solving, (b) collaboration, (c) adaptability, (d) initiative and entrepreneurism, (e) effective oral and written communication, (f) accessing and analyzing information, and (g) curiosity and imagination (Wagner, 2008). In this dissertation study, it is my claim that Harkness approaches can meet the goals for a 21st-century education.

1306,Progress in Education,"In Progress in Education. Volume 50, the authors present connectivity as a value that presents a numerical increase in the measure that leads to significant, transversal and related learning between the three dimensions analyzed. From these data alongside quotient positivity/negativity, learning dynamics can be characterized. The following chapter deals with the attitude of teachers towards inclusion and identifies several beliefs that are central to an inclusive mindset. Important theoretical constructs such as like self-efficacy, implicit theories of intelligence, and different models of disability are introduced, and their empirical significance in the context of inclusive education is discussed. Another study is included which explored older adults' motivations for and the benefits of participating in cooperative learning groups. Qualitative focus group discussions were held with 13 cooperative learning groups and a total of 93 older adults. The results indicated that the motivations behind participating in cooperative learning groups included curiosity, the desire to promote senior citizens learning camps, the desire to learn exercises, personal interests, the desire to leave the house, the desire to combat physical and mental deterioration, and recommendations from others. The authors present an integrated picture of resource distribution practices in the classroom setting. Rather than examining each resource distribution practice separately, the study conceptualizes all resource distribution practices as an interrelated system of evaluations structured along the dimensions of universalism. The authors set out to demonstrate to teachers, including trainee teachers, how they can use a set of virtual applications to teach the contents of any subject in order to promote an engagement in learning. Thus, they describe a study with trainee teachers to whom a set of apps were presented. During this research, the trainee teachers were taught how they could use these apps in their classes. This book includes a report on research conducted in four South African universities regarding the manner in which newly appointed lecturers join the pool of postgraduate research supervision teams and, most importantly, how interpersonal relations among newly appointed and long service lecturers play out regarding the universities' access to government subsidies for research output. This book also focuses on the psychological outcome of integrating the learner-oriented approach in the second language learning process of engineering students of the Universitat Polit<c3><a8>cnica of Val<c3><a8>ncia through synthesising second language learning and content objectives.

The purpose of the study was to identify the most typical conditions of schoolchildren of grades 6-11. In accordance with the purpose of the research, a questionnaire was developed to collect information on situations of appearance of states and their manifestations. It is established that the states of reflection, interest, concentration, thoughtfulness and curiosity are significant for all classes. Typical states in each of the studied periods of schoolchildren's learning are meditation, interest and concentration. The place of cognitive states among other mental states of schoolchildren and students is shown. Their share ranges from 39% to 53% of all significant states in the educational process. The specificity of the experience of cognitive states by schoolchildren of middle and high school is revealed. In 6-7 grades, cognitive states are combined with activity, joy, fun, excitement, in 8-9 grades with psychophysiological states of apathy, drowsiness, fatigue and strong-willed states of patience, tranquillity, in 10-11 grades with conditions of activity, cheerfulness, joy, fun, patience, tranquillity. The results of the research can find application in pedagogical activity. Knowledge of cognitive states and peculiarities of their actualization will allow to manage these states in a more effective way.

The system is a curiosity in terms of political ideology, social history, economics, design, delivery, and outcomes. Cuba's revolutionary medical system remains militarized. The methods responsible for the outstanding rates of child health indicators, including high rates of immunizations, have high costs in personal autonomy and privacy. Moreover, problems in evaluation persist at all levels of this unique, highly aligned system of government and social management. The Cuban health care system consists of multiple nested primary relationships, all originating at the family level. Hence, maintenance of a healthy lifestyle behavior consistent with the public health care system's goals is a duty of citizens, who are strongly influenced by the health care system at every level of personal and institutional interaction. Health care in Cuba is considered a qualified right, guaranteed to every citizen, regardless of productivity, class, family background, or position in the government. It is limited, however, for dissidents, those who are jailed for acts against the state. Medical genetics is a major part of daily health care practice in Cuba.

1315,Design of a college-level test of written communication: Theoretical and methodological challenges,"In contrast to our knowledge on the acquisition and early development of writing skills, our scientific understanding of the development of writing at the college level is relatively less advanced. In effect, a large part of the most influential empirical research on writing has focused on the development of basic writing and composition skills. Recent models of writing development have an increased curiosity for the development of writing beyond the acquisition of basic and composition and researchers have shown that relevant individual differences in text generation can be detected in mature writers. Renewed interest in writing at the college level was instigated by evidence suggesting that, after 12 years of schooling, only a small group of students are able to produce high-quality text. Notwithstanding the relevance of written communication skills (WCS), it was only recently that educational institutions started to seriously take the systematic assessment of these skills into account. Here, we present an initiative of writing assessment implemented in Chile. As in the United States, Chilean educational researchers have voiced a growing concern for the deficient acquisition of WCS. Although Chile does not administer an initiative for assessing writing such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the low achievement of Chilean students in both national and international standardized tests of language as well as the reported deficits found in the teaching of language suggest that there is room for improvement. Specifically, a recent national assessment of writing abilities (the first of its kind in Chile) found that only 24% of K-4 students achieved an advanced level of performance, according to the standards set in the test. As usual with educational achievement measures in Chile, writing performance was related to the socioeconomic level of the students. Fifty-five percent of the students coming from the lowest socioeconomic level did not achieve an intermediate level of performance, whereas at the highest socioeconomic level only 13% of the students were not able to reach that level of performance. Next, we will present the theoretical framework inspiring this assessment and discuss how it relates to other initiatives of writing assessment. Subsequently, we will show the assessment model underlying this initiative. Then, we will present the main results of the test of written communication implemented in the 2008 round of assessment. In closing, we will put these results in the context of the contemporary literature on writing assessment.

1319,CONCEPTUAL MAP-DIDACTIC STRATEGY USED DURING PHYSICS CLASSES,"The aim of this paper is to present the notion of ``conceptual map'' in the context of Physics classes, notion viewed as a teaching strategy focused on the student. The use of the conceptual map is based on the theory of Ausubel (mentioned in ref. [ 1]), which stipulates that ``the systematic learning of new concepts depends on the concepts already known by the student and on the connections which form between them''. This paper presents 3 types of conceptual maps: the ``spider-web'' type, the hierarchical one, and the linear one. The teaching method using these maps influences not only the student's interest and curiosity for studying Physics, but it also stimulates their originality of thought, fluency in discourse and flexibility in communication. Thus, the essence of knowledge consists in the way information is structured. What is really significant is not how much one knows, but how are the things one already knows connected between them.","Stoica, Daniela and Miron, Cristina and Jipa, Alexandru",0,,950

1321,Civic Engagement in Teacher Education: A Commitment to Democratic Ideals,"Civic engagement draws on the concepts of American democratic ideals such that society's interests are promulgated through the education of its citizenry. Ideas come to fruition in the form of community action, voting, involvement in the political process, and public discourse for promoting the commonwealth. Engendering in youth the commitment to the greater good and the necessity for participation are recognized as core principles within education. These civic lessons are also essential in preparing teachers to address contemporary educational problems. Through the author's experiences in higher education, she has noted three reasons that prospective university students enroll in teacher education. First, they are passionate about the subject matter and find personal gratification in exploring new ideas relevant to content, such as social studies. Second, preservice teachers love children and find the newness, curiosity, and developing minds of their students fascinating. The third reason for pursuing education is one of uncertainty. Examining these motives reveals a shared rationale, a desire to do something outside their current sphere of influence. This core belief is at the heart of a participatory democracy creating a natural merger between teacher education and civic engagement supported by the undergirding principals of social justice and equity.","Heafner, Tina L",0,,952
1322,Trends in solvent abuse in Scotland,"The deliberate inhalation of volatile substances dates back as far as ancient Greece. The modern habit, most commonly known as glue sniffing, appeared on the twentieth century American scene in the late nineteen fifties and has subsequently involved children and adolescents in Canada, Scandinavia, Western Europe, South Africa, South America, Japan and Britain. It was in November, 1970 that police in Lanarkshire in the West of Scotland first identified the existence of solvent abuse when teenagers of both sexes were apprehended because of their drunk and disorderly behaviour and taken to the local police station. It was then discovered that they were intoxicated on the fumes of industrial trichloroethylene and/or dry-cleaning substances which they had siphoned from vats outside local industrial works. During the last decade solvent abuse has attracted a great deal of interest, publicity and concern in Scotland just as it did in America. Despite this it is not a particularly common practice. Current data suggest that most children and adolescents are unlikely to experiment with solvent-containing substances. Those who do so are likely to be young teenage males who 'sniff' in groups and out-of-doors on a few occasions only. The main reasons for this behavior, as reported to others, are those of curiosity, peer group pressure and to provide a crutch to cope with problems.","Watson, J M",0,,953
1323,Towards Conceptualizing Language Learning Curiosity in SLA: An Empirical Study,"Why do some students frequently ask questions and actively seek out answers in the classroom, while others avoid this? Many language teachers might have commonly asked themselves this question. The present study is an empirical investigation of the concept of curiosity in the field of second language acquisition (SLA). Using a mixed-methods design, we aim to conceptualize language learning curiosity (LLC) within the framework of interest/deprivation (I/D) model of curiosity (Litman and Jimerson in J Personal Assess 82(2): 147-157, 2004. 10.1207/s15327752jpa8202_3) and see how it may be recognizably distinct from L2 psychological constructs, as well as how it connects with related constructs such as willingness to communicate, enjoyment, and anxiety. To measure LLC and depict its underlying dimensions, a new curiosity scale was developed and validated in this study. Overall, our results suggest that LLC can be conceived as an affective-cognitive variable reflecting an inquiry-driven interest and desire to learn and use a foreign language.","Mahmoodzadeh, Masoud and Khajavy, Gholam Hassan",0,10.1007/s10936-018-9606-3,954
1325,Teaching the history of science in physics classrooms - The story of the neutrino,"Because there is little connection between physics concepts and real life, most students find physics very difficult. In this frontline I have provided a timely link of the historical development using the basic story of neutrino physics and integrated this into introductory modern physics courses in high schools or in higher education. In this way an instructor may be able to build on students' curiosity in order to enhance the curriculum with some remarkable new physics. Using the history of science in the classroom shapes and improves students' views and knowledge of the nature of science and increase students' interest in physics. <c2><a9> 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Demirci, N",0,10.1088/0031-9120/51/4/043003,955
1327,Exploring the past to navigate the future: examining histories of higher dance education in China in an internationalized context,"China has a rich history of dance education and has established prominent tertiary dance institutions. Coupled with this is a growing global interest to engage with China, and connections are developing between Chinese and non-Chinese tertiary dance institutions. Within this curiosity and internationalization of dance education, there is the potential for authentic and exciting dialogue and exchange to occur. However, to allow such interactions to be the most beneficial it is of interest to look at the past of dance education in China to navigate the present and the future. Therefore, this article seeks to critically examine histories of higher dance education in China, to then provide critical understandings of higher dance education in China in the present and how these histories might inform future dance education. Within this article, there is a purposeful focus on the meanings of dance education in China, the relationship between politics and dance, and the examination-orientated education philosophies in teaching and learning dance within a Chinese context. <c2><a9> 2019, <c2><a9> 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Jin, J and Martin, R",0,10.1080/14647893.2019.1566304,956
1328,Academics in Early Childhood,"Children are exploring elements of literacy and numeracy. Such explorations begin in the earliest days of life and are a natural outgrowth of children's curiosity and interest in how the world works. Based on experiences, children build a reservoir of knowledge about language, reading, and mathematics that they take with them to kindergarten, first grade, and beyond. Unfortunately, some children are not having the kinds of early experiences they need to develop foundational knowledge and skills. In fact, kindergarten teachers report that one out of three children begin formal schooling lacking the basic experiences they need to succeed. Most often, these children come from families living close to or below the poverty line. Although growing up in a poor family does not guarantee school failure, children from such families are twice as likely as more advantaged children to be in the lowest quartile in reading, math, and general knowledge when they enter kindergarten. This creates gaps in achievement that influence all areas of development that can last throughout children's school careers. Lack of skill early on inhibits new skill development and makes it harder for children to catch up. However, the evidence that high quality early childhood programs can and do make a difference in these trajectories means teachers have reason to be optimistic that children can develop the skills they need as they participate in child care and other early learning programs from birth to age eight. But, how is this to be done? Research tells them that adults' abilities to create stimulating numeracy and literacy experiences for young children are significantly influenced by how well they understand three things: (1) the fundamental components of early literacy and numeracy; (2) how children experience literacy and mathematical concepts in their play; and (3) what teachers can do intentionally to support literacy and numeracy in all areas of the curriculum throughout the day. Teachers who lack adequate knowledge in any of these areas are hampered in their attempts to create developmentally appropriate programs for young children. Administrators who understand these components, too, are better able to support and guide early childhood staff.","Kostelnik, Marjorie",0,,957
1330,Development and Validation of K-ICT (Korea-Integrative Creativity Test) for Elementary and Secondary School Students,"Recently creativity to be a most interested concept to many people around the world and especially Korea. In education, even though teaching or learning creativity may seem to be very challenging tasks for educators, it is possible to discover the creativity of an individual and to develop this potential eventually. First of all, to develop the creativity it needs to be identified along with the developmental potentials for each individual student. The concept of creativity has defined by various by scholars. Lee (2002) suggested that creativity is a factor comprised of personal creative thinking ability and creative personality. It could produce new and unique forms of personal thinking ability and personality over developmental periods. According to the previous studies of the development of creativity, the tendency of development in elementary level students and secondary level students is not consistent. The study of discontinuity of developing creative traits might be related with cultural and social condition. However, to make sure this is the case, one needs to be confident about the test implementations and measures before taking a looking at developmental aspects. Most of the existing tests implementation occurred abroad and rarely reflected Korean cultural values, and lack of consistent theory about creativity development and logical model for measuring test development.. In this study, ``Integrative Creativity Test (K-ICT) for elementary school and secondary school students.'' was developed and validated. This test is standardized for Korean students and it was developed on the basis of the ``Volcano Model (Lee, 2002)'' and ``3-3-3 Model for Creativity Measurement (Lee, 2004)''. The volcano model is a concept model of creativity and the 3-3-3 Model is designed to measure the creativity of students. It consists of subject domain, creative thinking ability, and creative personality. The ``K-ICT'' involves two domains as language and drawing and creative thinking ability involves fluency, flexibility, originality, imagination, sensitivity and. Elaboration. Creative personality includes curiosity, sensitive personality, task commitment, humor, adventure and problem-solving leadership. The participants of this study were elementary school and secondary school (middle and high) students in order to develop and validate the test and then standardization in Korea. They (3005 elementary school students, 1669 middle school students and 1714 high school students) have randomly sampled from big cities, medium and small sized cities. The results of this study will offer three significant meanings for educators and researchers as follows. Firstly, the developmental trends of creativity for students from elementary level to high level will be identified using the test instrument that was development through this study. Secondly, it will help to develop the curriculum and teaching program for fostering the creativity for students in Korea and other countries. Thirdly, as yet most of the existing most of the tests were implemented abroad and rarely reflected Korean cultural values. The study, then, would contribute to generalize test developed for measuring the creativity of Korean students and will help to comparative researches of creativity with Korea and other countries (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Kyunghwa, Lee",0,10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.04.174,958
1331,Boa: A Language and Infrastructure for Analyzing Ultra-Large-Scale Software Repositories,"In today's software-centric world, ultra-large-scale software repositories, e. g. SourceForge (350,000+ projects), GitHub (250,000+ projects), and Google Code (250,000+ projects) are the new library of Alexandria. They contain an enormous corpus of software and information about software. Scientists and engineers alike are interested in analyzing this wealth of information both for curiosity as well as for testing important hypotheses. However, systematic extraction of relevant data from these repositories and analysis of such data for testing hypotheses is hard, and best left for mining software repository (MSR) experts! The goal of Boa, a domain-specific language and infrastructure described here, is to ease testing MSR-related hypotheses. We have implemented Boa and provide a web-based interface to Boa's infrastructure. Our evaluation demonstrates that Boa substantially reduces programming efforts, thus lowering the barrier to entry. We also see drastic improvements in scalability. Last but not least, reproducing an experiment conducted using Boa is just a matter of re-running small Boa programs provided by previous researchers.","Dyer, Robert and Nguyen, Hoan Anh and Rajan, Hridesh and Nguyen, Tien N",0,,959
1333,Review of Deciphering the cosmic number: The strange friendship of Wolfgang Pauli and Carl Jung ,"Reviews the book, Deciphering the Cosmic Number: The Strange Friendship of Wolfgang Pauli and Carl Jung by Arthur I. Miller (2009). In this book author approaches the shared enterprise of Pauli, the Nobel Laureate physicist, and Jung, the Swiss psychiatrist and analyst. The notion of 137 as a cosmic number is Miller's Ariadnian thread through the labyrinths of different disciplines and unexpected duos of personality, interest and inquiry. He evokes the number as occasion to gather his knowledge of mathematics and physics, to pursue his interest in the mingling and matching of creative minds, and to satisfy his curiosity about interdisciplinary resonances. Much of the information Miller presents has been available from other sources, and whether 137 was a shared preoccupation to the extent Miller suggests, his focus on the history and problem of three and four in Jung's intuitive probings and Pauli's pursuit of four quantum numbers is enlightening. Miller's speculations about the personal lives and meetings between his two subjects is, for me, the least compelling section of his work. Miller points us to the remaining great questions of the present and future of the complete universe: what is the place of consciousness in the universe, and what compels the human mind towards understanding its world and attempting to relate to and find its place in the universe.

1334,Empowering Learners,"Turning students into lifelong learners is not easily accomplished. How do school librarians ensure that students have a zeal for learning? How do they encourage, cajole, or entice students to want to learn? The answer lies in empowering students with the skills they need to enjoy researching as well as reading for information and pleasure. This article focuses on the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) Learning4Life (L4L) program and discusses how school librarians can empower learners through this initiative. The author concludes that becoming an empowered learner does not happen overnight but, it results from careful exposure to ideas, concepts, and skills that nurture curiosity, creativity, and interest in students. By carefully piquing student interest on all levels, school librarians empower them to become life long learners.","Franklin, Pat and Stephens, Claire Gatrell",0,,961

1340,Unintended Learning in Primary School Practical Science Lessons from Polanyi's Perspective of Intellectual Passion,"This study explored, from the perspective of intellectual passion developed by Michael Polanyi, the unintended learning that occurred in primary practical science lessons. We use the term `unintended' learning to distinguish it from `intended' learning that appears in teachers' learning objectives. Data were collected using video and audio recordings of a sample of twenty-four whole class practical science lessons, taught by five teachers, in Korean primary schools with 10- to 12-year-old students. In addition, video and audio recordings were made for each small group of students working together in order to capture their activities and intra-group discourse. Pre-lesson interviews with the teachers were undertaken and audio-recorded to ascertain their intended learning objectives. Selected key vignettes, including unintended learning, were analysed from the perspective of intellectual passion developed by Polanyi. What we found in this study is that unintended learning could occur when students got interested in something in the first place and could maintain their interest. In addition, students could get conceptual knowledge when they tried to connect their experience to their related prior knowledge. It was also found that the processes of intended learning and of unintended learning were different. Intended learning was characterized by having been planned by the teacher who then sought to generate students' interest in it. In contrast, unintended learning originated from students' spontaneous interest and curiosity as a result of unplanned opportunities. Whilst teachers' persuasive passion comes first in the process of intended learning, students' heuristic passion comes first in the process of unintended learning. Based on these findings, we argue that teachers need to be more aware that unintended learning, on the part of individual students, can occur during their lesson and to be able to better use this opportunity so that this unintended learning can be shared by the whole class. Furthermore, we argue that teachers' deliberate action and a more interactive classroom culture are necessary in order to allow students to develop, in addition to heuristic passion, persuasive passion towards their unintended learning.","Park, Jisun and Song, Jinwoong and Abrahams, Ian",0,10.1007/s11191-015-9788-0,964
1341,Development of an Assessment for Measuring Middle School Student Attitudes towards Robotics Activities,"The next generation of world citizens must be technologically fluent members of society. By technological fluency we mean the ability to manipulate technology creatively and for one's own use. This fluency is composed of knowledge and skills utilizing materials and tools, as well as attitudes, (e.g. confidence), with respect to technology. Numerous interventions exist to support middle school students' technological fluency, and robotics activities are popular. It is critical that instruments assessing student attitudes towards robotics are available for the development and evaluation of these interventions. We present an instrument for assessing middle school students' technological fluency attitudes specifically tailored for robotics activities. Survey subscales were developed from existing science motivation research, and individual measurement items were generated and adapted within those subscales. The robotics activity attitudes scale (RAAS) was revised through three rounds of pilot testing in 2010, 2012 and 2015. The final RAAS in 2015 consisted of 50 items with an overall Cronbach's alpha of .972 (N=236) organized in four dimensions of Curiosity, Interest, Expectancy Value, and Confidence and Identity.","Cross, Jennifer and Hamner, Emily and Zito, Lauren and Nourbakhshh, Illah and Bernstein, Debra",0,,965

The method engages students' interest and curiosity by allowing them to complete projects that relate to real-world situations. This method of learning requires teachers to plan and develop projects that encourage students to work individually and in groups to solve problems, plan, collaborate, make decisions, develop technology skills and present projects to their peers. Project-based learning was implemented in a high school classroom. The effectiveness of Project-based learning implementation in the high school geometry classroom was assessed and analyzed to see if technology use and hands-on experiences improved the level of students' mathematical comprehension. Students expressed a sense of satisfaction in learning mathematical concepts through the use of technology and hands-on experiences. Mathematical concepts became clearer with the use of tangible objects and technological devices. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Chin, William",0,,968
1347,Can the Past Inform the Future of Science in Primary Schools?,"This article reports the main findings from a Review commissioned by the Wellcome Trust into science in primary schools. On the basis of those findings, it is argued that the current approach to primary science and the drive to raise standards in literacy and numeracy are turning pupils off science in primary schools, the fallout of which can be seen in secondary, further and higher education. The authors' interpretations of the findings of the Review lead them to argue that the current approach to primary science in schools is not fostering scientific thought and curiosity to the extent that may be possible. The major problem lies in the way in which the results of the current assessment procedures in schools in England are used. The authors think that there is an argument for a careful reconsideration of the current approach to the teaching and assessment of science in English primary schools. They recommend a four-stage strategy: (1) the need of a national debate about the purpose of science in primary schools; (2) establish the evidence base; (3) develop new approaches and trial them; and (4) the efficacy of new and existing programmes should undergo scientific evaluation involving randomised controlled trials.

1350,"Preparing Teachers to Be Curious, Open Minded, and Actively Reflective: Dewey's Ideas Reconsidered","Teachers need to be prepared to cultivate the dispositions and attitudes that are necessary for individual and societal learning and growth in a democracy. In this article I describe how Dewey thought about teacher educators and creating a living democracy through the cultivation of curiosity, open-mindedness, and reflective and active thinking. Curiosity is the desire to continue learning about one's interests in ways that fulfill one's potential and contribute to society; open-mindedness is welcoming of a variety of ideas and perspectives; and reflective and active inquiry is geared toward constantly improving democracy and the quality of people's experiences. Teacher educators need to attend to the cultivation of these attitudes in their students by providing learning environments wherein new teachers' curiosities are fostered, where open-mindedness to views different from their own is nurtured, and where capabilities to think about matters important to the education of K-12 students in a democracy are cultivated. <c2><a9> 2006, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Meadows, E",0,10.1080/01626620.2006.10463406,972
1351,The relation between individual interest and knowledge acquisition,"The objective of this study was to examine how individual interest and knowledge acquisition are causally related. Three hypotheses were tested using a cross-lagged panel analysis (N=186) and two quasi-experimental studies (N=68 and N=108) involving students from schools in Singapore. The first hypothesis is the broadly shared standard assumption on the relation between individual interest and knowledge: the more an individual is interested in a topic, the more (s)he is willing to engage in learning. An alternative hypothesis assumes that individual interest is not the cause but the consequence of the process of learning: individual interest as an affective by-product of learning. Finally, a third possibility is that interest and knowledge influence each other reciprocally. The results supported the affective-by-product hypothesis. Our findings seem at variance with commonly held conceptions that being interested guides knowledge attainment. The implications of these findings for interest research are discussed.","Rotgans, Jerome I and Schmidt, Henk G",0,10.1002/berj.3268,973
1354,Parasitology as a teaching tool: Isolation of apicomplexan cysts from store-bought meat,"Our goal was to design a bench experiment tailored to the environment of advanced high school biology, college freshman biology, and nonmajor labs. To accomplish this goal, we developed a scientific protocol for isolation of apicomplexan cysts from store-bought meat by adapting existing protocols (Cornelissen et al., 1981; Blewett et al., 1983; Dubey, 1992, 1998; Omata et al., 1997; Garcia et al., 2006). The majority of buffers used were common chemicals found in many introductory biology laboratories, and the protocol is simple enough for a freshman to use. What we found to be most challenging was modifying the experiment to fit time constraints imposed by a typical high school schedule. This experiment takes <e2><88><bc>3 h. We found that the lab could be split up into 4 d for high school and 2 d for college. The teacher should make some initial preparations (i.e., making buffers and solutions) to shorten the lab period. We suggest that students split up into at least five groups of six students each. The students should be encouraged to compare and share their results. We recommend that the students spend time researching T. gondii statistics on the CDC website (www.cdc.gov) and reading newspapers to identify related topics, such as food recalls as a result of tainted product. Specifically, we suggest creating a quiz to test their knowledge of food safety and administering it before and after the exercise. We would also suggest including a follow-up discussion section investigating student response to this assignment. For example, how has completing this laboratory exercise affected their opinions about food, science, and laboratory experiments? We have listed several very useful websites in Materials and Methods. These sites are extremely helpful in providing pictures for identification purposes and background information on the parasites themselves. In addition to T. gondii, numerous other organisms (i.e., multiple types of nematodes and tapeworms) can be observed by sampling the bottom of the meat slurry instead of the supernatant. Although we had multiple years of experience at the lab bench, we found that we were surprised by the abundance and diversity of organisms in meat. It provoked us to ask the question: ""Just who is eating who?"" Although many of these pathogens are species specific and thus not a health threat to human (i.e., N. caninum), some of the organisms, such as T. gondii, are human pathogens. We realized that it reinvigorated our interest in the topic, and we were fascinated by the images in the microscope. Some of us could not eat meat for a week after doing the experiment. This realization validated for us the idea that science at the bench as opposed to simple book learning is essential for biology and nonmajors students alike. It drives home the point that well-prepared foods (washing and cooking) are a cornerstone of food safety. Carrying out this experiment familiarizes students with the microscope and more advanced isolation techniques such as the use of Percoll. It introduces some concepts about parasitology and food safety. It can be incorporated into a lesson plan covering infectious agents or health. It meets Indiana secondary school standards for advanced life sciences (standard 2: health, safety, and microbiology of food), and human anatomy and physiology (standard 10: immune mechanisms). Completion of this exercise also meets national educational standards for secondary school in the topics science as inquiry, interdependence of organisms, personal and community health, and science as a human endeavor (National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment, 1996). Upon completion of this exercise, the following positive outcomes are expected for students: 1) gain confidence about ability to carry out labwork and stimulate curiosity about pursuing other science classes, 2) obtain insight about health and safety of food and provide students the chance to critically evaluate articles in the newspaper regarding food recalls, and 3) change student behavior in terms of food choice, food preparation behavior, or both. In sum, the ultimate outcome of this exercise is for students to apply the procedure to investigate a real and meaningful problem and, as a result, to describe organisms found in the meat supply, the hazards they pose, and procedures for avoiding the hazard. Because there is a compelling repulsion factor, there is a strong possibility that students would also change their behavior (either food choices or food preparation behavior). For teachers, it represents an innovative teaching strategy that provides a relatively inexpensive laboratory experience with direct student involvement that meets several national education standards. <c2><a9> 2008 by The American Society for Cell Biology.","Eggleston, T L and Fitzpatrick, E and Hager, K M",0,10.1187/cbe.07-08-0062,974

An examination of intentions, curiosity, depressive symptoms, and life satisfaction","Despite a variety of interventions to increase well-being, little is known about who is interested in and initiates exercises on their own. We explored individual differences that predict who is most likely to participate in a voluntary gratitude intervention. College students (n = 226) completed measures of curiosity, depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and intentions to change their lifestyle. Afterwards, participants received a personalized invitation to take part in a web-based intervention to enhance their well-being (anonymous and strictly voluntary). Results suggested that 11.5% of participants started the gratitude intervention. Individuals endorsing strong intentions to change their lifestyle (+1 SD above mean) were 2.2 times more likely than their peers to start the gratitude intervention. People with greater trait curiosity endorsed greater intentions to start this intervention; people with greater depressive symptoms endorsed weaker intentions. Both curiosity and depressive symptoms indirectly influenced initiation of the gratitude intervention via intentions. These findings provide support for particular paths that lead to the initial behavioral effort towards healthy change. We discuss the implications for attempting to increase and sustain people's well-being. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Lagercrantz's book on infant brain development is a pleasure to read for its style and substance. Readers who enjoy reading Allison Gopnik's research on theory of mind in infants (Gopnik, Meltzoff, & Bryant, 1997; Gopnik & Wellman, 1992) or Franz de Waal's work on social and affective neuroscience will find that this work is of a similar cast (Preston & de Waal, 2002). As Lagercrantz described it, nothing about his book is ""airy-fairy."" It focuses on the substrates of consciousness, how they develop, when and why. The emergence of the infant mind is built on the accumulation of small gains and the integrity of brain substrates. His book is likely to be of greatest interest to neuropsychologists and neuroscientists, particularly those on internal review boards evaluating pre- and perinatal research, and child or developmental psychologists. However, any reader interested in consciousness may appreciate the gentle and straightforward way in which the author describes many of the relevant domains of neuroscience. Lagercrantz's curiosity is contagious, and his book introduces some of the language and ideas within neuroscience that allow a more clinical or philosophically minded reader to venture into that literature with more comfort.

1358,Curiosity and self-directed learning readiness among a sample of baccalaureate nursing students,"Self-directed learning and curiosity have been described in the literature as desirable characteristics of the adult learner. These characteristics are thought to contribute to success in the development of lifelong learning. A high degree of curiosity was one of eight characteristics of a highly self-directed learner identified by Guglielmino (1977/1978). The purpose of the exploratory study was to examine the relationship between curiosity and self-directed learning readiness in a sample of adult learners. Specifically, the study was designed to address two problems: the association between self-directed learning readiness (SDLR) and curiosity; and the association among nursing students' educational level, SDLR, and curiosity. This research was based on a cross-sectional design comprised of a convenience sample of 170 generic and career ladder nursing students enrolled in an accredited baccalaureate nursing program. Data used in this study were obtained from two sources: direct request from the subjects, and the institution's academic records. Guglielmino's (1977/1978) Self-Directed Learning Readiness Scale (SDLRS-A) was used to measure readiness for self-directed learning and Rossing's (1978) curiosity materials were used to measure curiosity (desire for knowledge). Demographic and biographical data for age, sex, marital status, ethnicity, and educational level were obtained. The curiosity materials, based on Berlyne's theory of epistemic curiosity, included ten psychological experiment accounts and participants rated three responses: (1) how surprising or unexpected the results were; (2) how valuable or useful the information was; and (3) how strongly they wanted to know more about the experiments. Statistically significant and positive associations exist between (1) SDLR and desire for knowledge; (2) SDLR and perceived valuel and (3) perceived value and desire for further knowledge. The situational variables of surprise and perceived value were the best predictors of curiosity about psychological research. It was concluded that perceived value represents an extrinsic motivational component for the intrinsic need for knowledge, or curiosity. A pattern of decline in curiosity scores among progressive educational levels exists for the sample and suggests that schooling may have a negative effect on curiosity. A moderate positive association exists between SDLR and subject-matter interest suggesting the possibility of an intrinsic orientation to learning.

1360,The Oxford Handbook of Human Motivation,"Motivation is that which moves us to action. Human motivation is thus a complex issue, as people are moved to action by both their evolved natures and by myriad familial, social, and cultural influences. The Oxford Handbook of Human Motivation aims to capture the current state-of-the-art in this fast developing field. The book includes theoretical overviews from some of the best-known thinkers in this area, including articles on Social Learning Theory, Control Theory, Self-determination Theory, Terror Management Theory, and the Promotion and Prevention perspective. Topical articles appear on phenomena such as ego-depletion, flow, curiosity, implicit motives, and personal interests. A section specifically highlights goal research, including chapters on goal regulation, achievement goals, the dynamics of choice, unconscious goals and process versus outcome focus. Still other articles focus on evolutionary and biological underpinnings of motivation, including articles on cardiovascular dynamics, mood, and neuropsychology. Finally, articles bring motivation down to earth in reviewing its impact within relationships, and in applied areas such as psychotherapy, work, education, sport, and physical activity. <c2><a9> 2012 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

1361,What Happens to Animals during Hurricanes? Teachable Moments with Extreme Weather and Animals,"Students are concerned about what happens to the animals in the aftermath of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tsunami. They have remarkable compassion for animals. Students want to know if dolphins, manatees, and sea turtles survive. Furthermore, they want to know what they can do to help. Hence, a variety of teachable moments emerge from these incidents. Student curiosity provides a springboard for discussions ranging from weather, to conservation, to biology. Teachers can use these real-world events that spark students' interest to integrate content and interdisciplinary activities. Additionally, students can learn about ways they can help the environment recover from natural disasters. This article talks about the pollution and biological effects of hurricanes and tsunamis to the animals and provides biology and conservation activities that can help middle school teachers integrate various subjects into their weather lessons using students' concern for animals as a starting point. Additionally, by incorporating the information included about hurricane and tsunami impacts on animals, teachers can effectively address the National Science Education Standards in a meaningful way.

1366,First developments of the young savage of Aveyron,"A child of eleven or twelve, who some years before had been seen completely naked in the Caune Woods seeking acorns and roots to eat, was met in the same place toward the end of September 1799 by three sportsmen who seized him as he was climbing into a tree to escape from their pursuit. Conducted to a neighboring hamlet and confided to the care of a widow, he broke loose at the end of a week and gained the mountains, where he wandered during the most rigorous winter weather, draped rather than covered with a tattered shirt. At night he retired to solitary places but during the day he approached the neighboring villages, where of his own accord he entered an inhabited house situated in the Canton of St. Sernin. There he was retaken, watched and cared for during two or three days and transferred to the hospital of Saint- Afrique, then to Rodez, where he was kept for several months. During his sojourn in these different places he remained equally wild and shy, impatient and restless, continually seeking to escape. He furnished material for most interesting observations, which were collected by credible witnesses whose accounts I shall not fail to report in this essay where they can be displayed to the best advantage. It can easily be understood that a creature of this kind could excite only a momentary curiosity. People ran in crowds, they saw him without observing him, they passed judgment on him without knowing him, and spoke no more about him. In the midst of this general indifference the administrators of the National Institute of the Deaf and Dumb and its celebrated director never forgot that society, in taking over this unfortunate youth, had contracted towards him binding obligations that must be fulfilled. Sharing then the hopes which I founded upon a course of medical treatment, they decided that this child should be confided to my care. But before the details and results of this decision are presented I must begin with an account of our starting point and recall and describe this first period, in order that the progress we have made may be better appreciated. By thus contrasting the past with the present, we can determine what ought to be expected from the future. Obliged then to return to facts already known, I will state these briefly; and that I may not be suspected of having exaggerated for the purpose of contrast, I will venture here to give a careful analysis of the description given of the boy, in a meeting to which I had the honor of being admitted, by a doctor whose genius for observation is as famous as his profound knowledge of mental diseases. I classified under five principal aims the mental and moral education of the Wild Boy of Aveyron. 1st Aim. To interest him in social life by rendering it more pleasant to him than the one he was then leading, and above all more like the life which he had just left. 2nd Aim. To awaken his nervous sensibility by the most energetic stimulation, and occasionally by intense emotion. 3rd Aim. To extend the range of his ideas by giving him new needs and by increasing his social contacts. 4th Aim. To lead him to the use of speech by inducing the exercise of imitation through the imperious law of necessity. 5th Aim. To make him exercise the simplest mental operations upon the objects of his physical needs over a period of time afterwards inducing the application of these mental processes to the objects of instruction.

1367,Teaching the Constitution to Twenty-First Century Students,"Civic education in public schools faces major challenges. Under No Child Left Behind, many schools have favored teaching math and English rather than civics, which undermines one of the purposes of public schools--to educate students to be responsible and active citizens in democracy. A second challenge comes inside the classroom: engaging the interest of students in civics, and increasing their knowledge and analytical skills. Teaching about the Constitution can sometimes be overly dry and textual, and may be hampered by the fact that the language of the eighteenth century can make the document seem remote and distant to students. Nevertheless, it is possible to make it exciting and engaging, so that students appreciate the relevance of its principles to everyday public life and contemporary issues. The study of the Bill of Rights, for example, does not have to rely only on using a textbook or having students memorize the main points of the ten amendments. This article presents a lesson plan from the Sandra Day O'Connor Civic Education Project which involves students directly in the Bill of Rights by stimulating their curiosity and challenging their knowledge and thinking skills. The purpose of the lesson plan is to expose students to controversies or complaints and discover whether or not the Constitution addresses those issues.","Jackson, Peggy S and Hinde, Elizabeth R and Haas, Nancy S",0,,983

1370,Arguing global warming: The reception and uses of climate change science,"Over the last three decades, global warming has evolved from a scientific curiosity into a significant social problem. Despite the emergence of a strong scientific consensus that the warming of the last 50 years is the result human activities and that future warming driven by human activities could pose significant risk, the United States federal government has enacted no meaningful policies towards a reduction of the greenhouse gases that strongly contribute to the warming. This dissertation argues that a major factor influencing the lack of policy development is the uses and reception of climate change science in public policy debates. Looking closely at the uses of the science as presented by the Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change Third Assessment Report, the study argues that the policy debates are grounded in an idealized and problematic conception of scientific knowledge as authoritative, objective, and able to rationally prescribe policy. This erroneous understanding of science creates the opportunity for rhetorical exploitation of science that conceals partisan political interests and obscures other important issues necessary to address the problem. The study focuses on two primary manifestations of that phenomenon. The first is the exploitation of the uncertainty that is characteristic of the contingent knowledge produced by the scientific process coupled with the attempt to diminish the scientific ethos of the IPCC. The second is the reduction of the vast body of evidence on which the report is based to the discussion of a single scientific paper that, in turn, is then used to represent the IPCC report as a whole.

1371,An Example of Prepared-Planned Creative Drama in Second Grade Mathematics Education,"The aim of this research is teaching addition with natural numbers and the concept of large and small natural numbers in the second grade mathematics course, through creative drama method. The study has been applied to 31 elementary school second grade students studying at a public school in the province of Aydin. In this research, case study based on observation method, which is one of the qualitative research methods, has been employed. The data have been collected through drama lesson plans, observation, and interview methods. The activities involving the acquisitions of ''adding two-digit natural numbers'' and ''absorbing large-small concepts'' prepared by the researcher, have been applied in the classroom. The drawings of students, literary notes, and observation reports kept by researchers have been used in the evaluation of the activity. As a result of this application, students' views towards the questions covering the whole application have been gathered. The results of the study suggest that prepared-planned creative drama activities are an entertaining and enjoyable way for students to learn. The notes taken by the participative observers and findings obtained from the interviews indicate that drama activities increase sharing among students and that the students could associate what they have learned with some of the situations they encounter in their every day-life. It is observed that the students learn by having more fun while playing games, which involves a high amount of physical movements. Drawing the attention of students through instructions in the warm-up phase of the activity increased students' curiosity in learning. In the animation phase of the activity, it was observed that the students' interest in the mathematics increased, they had fun while making the mathematical operations, their participation to the lesson was high throughout the activity, the energy they received from the lesson was at the maximum level, they learned by doing and living, and they obtained an experience they could use in their every day-life. In the evaluation phase of the activity, the students were asked to describe how they felt by drawing a picture or writing a story as a summary of the creative drama activity they experiences by doing. According to the stories they have written and the pictures they have drawn, it is apparent that they were entertained and happy throughout the activity. The results of this study indicate that the students relieve their mental exhaustion and a relaxed classroom setting is achieved through the relaxation activities.","<c3><96>zsoy, Nesrin and <c3><96>zyer, Sinan and Akdeniz, Nesibe and Alko<c3><a7>, Aysenur",0,,986
1372,Curiosity and Pedagogy: A Mixed-Methods Study of Student Experiences in the Design Studio,"Curiosity is often considered the foundation of learning. There is, however, little understanding of how (or if) pedagogy in higher education affects student curiosity, especially in the studio setting of architecture, interior design, and landscape architecture. This study used mixed-methods to investigate curiosity among design students in the studio setting. Findings showed no significant relationship between curiosity and academic achievement, no significant difference in curiosity levels between female and male design students, and no significant difference in curiosity levels across various year levels or age groups. Results also revealed that the studio environment played a minor role in the origin and influence of student interests; student curiosities were affected more by travel, internships, family, and non-studio courses.

1374,A qualitative study of motivation to read for pleasure with adolescent struggling readers using a theoretical model: How to begin?,"A mixed method study explored a theoretical model that employed, combined, and added to the theories of self-determination, the reading engagement perspective, and the four-phase model of interest to motivate adolescent struggling readers to read for pleasure. The model adds to the existing body of research because it specifies an instructional starting point focusing on the powerful intrinsic motivation to read constructs of curiosity, involvement, and interest. Three teachers at different schools implemented the model with 18 students. The results and implementation varied with each teacher. Initially, students responded with an increased motivation to read for pleasure. From there, success varied with the remaining phases. Teachers had limited success with the second phase of the four-phase model of interest development. One teacher aptly maintained interest, one was unsuccessful, and the last teacher maintained interest with motivated students and led the others to more titles. All encountered difficulties when motivation to read waned. All teachers also encountered obstacles and implemented methods to restart pleasure reading. Two teachers had limited knowledge of young adult literature which affected motivation to read for pleasure. Throughout the study positive social interaction patterns positively affected students' motivations to read. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Fisher, Gary A",0,,988

1377,A Case for Domain-Specific Curiosity in Mathematics,"Epistemic curiosity is a desire for knowledge accompanied by positive emotions, increased arousal, and exploratory behavior (Grossnickle, Educational Psychology Review, 28(1), 23-60, 2016). Although curiosity has typically been characterized as a domain-general construct, domain-general conceptualizations do not acknowledge systematic changes in an individuals' development (e.g., domain knowledge) as they advance within a domain. Moreover, a domain-general conceptualization of curiosity stands in direct contrast to research on interest, given that interest is typically described as domain-specific (e.g., interest for mathematics). Without a domain-specific conceptualization of curiosity as it relates to development within academic domains, comparisons between curiosity and interest will remain muddled. In the present theoretical review, we put forward a conceptualization of curiosity as domain-specific and examine how the components of curiosity develop within one academic domain: mathematics. In doing so, we juxtapose conceptualizations of epistemic curiosity with literature related to the development of other epistemic factors (i.e., knowledge, epistemic beliefs) in mathematics. Specifically, we build on the knowledge gap theories of epistemic curiosity (Litman, Personality and Individual Differences, 48(4), 397-410, 2010; Loewenstein, Psychological Bulletin, 116(1), 75-98, 1994) to consider developmental shifts in (a) knowledge gaps, (b) heightened arousal, and (c) exploratory behaviors within the domain of mathematics. Understanding the domain-specific and developmental nature of curiosity is critical for distinguishing curiosity from interest and for supporting motivation within mathematics classrooms.","Peterson, Emily Grossnickle and Cohen, Jana",0,10.1007/s10648-019-09501-4,991
1380,Modeling information seeking under perceived risk,"Information seeking and information avoidance are the mechanisms humans natural used for coping with uncertainties and adapting to environmental stressors. Uncertainties are rooted in knowledge gaps. In social sciences, the relationship between knowledge gaps and perceived risk have received little attention. A review of the information science literature suggests that few studies have been devoted to the investigation of the role of this relationship in motivating information-seeking behavior. As an effort to address the lack of theory building in the field of information science, this study attempts to construct a model of information seeking under risk (MISR) by examining the relationships among perceived risk, knowledge gap, fear arousal, risk propensity, personal relevance, and deprivation and interest curiosity as antecedents to motivation to seek information. An experimental approach and a scenario-based survey method are employed to design the study. Partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis was conducted to test the relationships in the proposed model. Perceived risk was found to be a highly significant predictor of information seeking in moderately high-risk situations. Similarly, personal relevant has a significant negative effect on perceived risk and its interaction with knowledge gap motivates information seeking.

The development of this book stemmed from popular interest in the sex myths addressed in the authors' first two books. They report that people seemed the most interested in discussing information relating to questions about sex. In this book, they promise answers to ""all those crazy questions"" about sex, and that these answers will ""make you the life of the party"". While the authors aim to satisfy readers' curiosity for many questions, they also educate and thus reduce the risks associated with erroneous assumptions. Sex myths that perpetuate insecurities, contribute to anxiety, and misinformation about sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy can have serious consequences to one's health; therefore, this book's purpose and contents extend beyond curiosity satisfaction. This book is not a forum to discuss myths relating to performance pressures, distress, and questions relating to gender dysphoria, presumptions about affairs, common misunderstanding about pain experienced during sexual activity, and many others pertinent to the sex therapist's work and the human sexual experience. This book would make a great addition to sexual health curricula for adolescents.

It was more than 15 years ago that the University of Barcelona [1-2] started a summer course. ``I love Biochemistry'' [3-4] for secondary school students (1997-1998 school course) and ``Updating Biochemistry and Molecular Biology'' [5-6] (1998-1999 school course) responding to the high-school teachers' need for receiving training in the latest scientific developments; in biochemistry, molecular biology and biotechnology to be precise. This summer course, designed by the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology [7] of the University of Barcelona for the benefit of secondary school science teachers, wants to be a bridge between the two educational systems, High School and University, with the main goal of helping science teachers. The purpose of this article is to analyze this summer course and it presents details about some concepts in biochemistry, molecular biology and biotechnology and it represents a stimulating manner to the teachers. Moreover, details of web, university and scientists resources have been offered so that teachers can access the information and the technical support for their experiments. The teachers' opinion was very positive. Their optimistic replies have allowed us to make some innovations in the course and add new concepts and experiments for the improvement of teaching biochemistry, molecular biology and biotechnology in the science classroom. The course has contributed to increase secondary school science teachers' curiosity and fomenting their participation; to revitalize the relationship between university and secondary schools and to reinforce the general and social study of biochemistry. Finally, the goal is to increase knowledge and interest in biochemistry and related sciences in High School science teachers so they can transmit them to High School students to ensure a new generation of researchers.","Fernandez-Novell, Josep M and Arimany, Cristina and Medina, Lorena",0,,994

1386,Measuring reflective functioning in adolescents: Relations to personality disorders and psychological difficulties,"Background: Reflective Functioning (RF) is considered to play a central role in risk and resilience for psychological difficulties such as borderline personality disorder (BPD) and has become an important treatment target of transdiagnostic psychosocial interventions like Mentalization Based Therapy. However, a lack of measures to assess RF in adolescents has hampered research that can further elucidate the role of RF in different types of psychopathology. Objective: The objective of the present study was to examine the validity of the Reflective Functioning Questionnaire for Youth (RFQ-Y), examine the factor structure of the french RFQ-Y, the relationship between RFQ-Y and social cognition, psychological difficulties, BPD and narcissistic personality disorders. Method: A total of 533 adolescents and young adults (age 12-21) from the community completed the RFQ-Y, the Child Behaviour Checklist, the Borderline Personality Features Scale and the Pathological Narcissism Inventory. A subsample of 150 participants completed the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC). Results: Three factors were identified. Uncertainty/confusion was strongly positively correlated with psychological difficulties, especially symptoms of borderline personality disorder. Interest/curiosity was negatively correlated with psychopathology and Excessive Certainty was positively correlated with grandiose narcissism. RFQ-Y factors correlated more strongly with psychopathology than the MASC scales. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the validity of self-report measures like the RFQ-Y and its utility for identifying problematic styles of mentalizing associated with increased risk of psychopathology in general, as well as difficulties like narcissism in particular.

1387,Humboldt's nodes and modes of interdisciplinary environmental science in the Andean world,"Alexander von Humboldt engaged in a staggering array of diverse experiences in the Andes and adjoining lowlands of northwestern South America between 1801 and 1803. Yet examination of Humboldt's diaries, letters, and published works shows how his principal activities in the Andes centered on three interests: mining and geological landscapes; communications and cartography; and use and distribution of the quinine-yielding cinchona trees. Each node represented a pragmatic concern dealing with environmental resources in the context of the Andes. To pursue these interests in his Andean field studies, Humboldt relied on varied cultural interactions and vast social networks for knowledge exchange, in addition to extensive textual comparisons. These modes of inquiry dovetailed with his pragmatic interests and his open-ended intellectual curiosity. Fertile combinations in his Andean studies provided the foundation and main testing ground for Humboldt's fused nature-culture approach as well as his contributions to early geography and interdisciplinary environmental science.

1388,Real and Irreal Places in Children's Compositions: Result of a Survey,"A study analyzed children's compositions from grades 1-4 in Slovenian schools. Children described real places within the framework of an experientially provable world, which is empirically available to them within the limits of their abilities and possibilities. Irreal places were described inventively without the support of experience, although some elements of imitation can be observed. When describing irreal places, children autonomously discover the world through their imagination. The concept can be realistically understood as creative writing on the children's part. In choosing their topics and way of verbal and artistic expression, they strongly leaned on reality experienced through their senses and on authentic presentation. In these compositions: the central literary character is a contemporary urban child; time and place of action are defined; the scene is set either in the family or school environment during spare time; the story presents only sections of the child's everyday life--his contacts with the familiar and non-familiar places and their inhabitants, his adventures in discovering new places. Compositions are about the child's mostly positive, seldom negative experiences. They are short, chronologically following a linear form and narrated in the first-person, from the child's point of view, with an individualized central character, and frequently depict events on holiday, on a trip, and in school. Children show a greater measure of inventiveness and imagination when describing irreal places than when discussing real ones. For the latter they seem to lack the experience, while the former are of greater interest to them because of their innate curiosity and love of discovering new and unknown objects.

1389,Starting and stopping: Adolescents' decision-making about drug use,"Use of alcohol, tobacco and other addictive drugs (ATD) is a well-recognized public health concern and one of society's greatest problems. Evidence indicates that some youth begin and end drug use during adolescence. A grounded theory methodology was used to explore adolescents' views of their experience of beginning and ending ATD use. A Basic Social Psychological Process, Starting and Stopping, was identified from 12 interviews. Informants were age 14 to 18, had tried drugs at least 6 times and abstained for at least 6 months. Decision making about drug use was described. Three stages of use that led to decision points were found. If adolescents did not stop use during the beginning stage, Exploratory Use, the adolescents had the potential to progress through two additional stages of use, Purposeful Use and Intentional Use. The intensity of use increased with each stage. Each stage had identifiable triggers and barriers that had the potential to influence continued ATD use. Curiosity was a strong stimulus for beginning drug use and then exploring never-used-before drugs. An intervening dramatic event moved adolescents more quickly toward stopping. Future orientation was present as informants stopped drug use. Decisional points were characterized by the integration of what adolescents felt were benefits of use (friend relationships, liking the experience, learning about drugs, getting relief from perceived problems) and barriers to continued use (no continued interest, not liking the experience, goals obtained, effect on relationships, effect on future, dramatic event). A Basic Social Structural Process was beginning to emerge. The structural process included drug availability, peer drug use and societal environment. The theory of adolescent decision-making about ATD use provides an opportunity for health professionals to better understand adolescent drug use.

1399,Curiosity driven reinforcement learning for motion planning on humanoids,"Most previous work on artificial curiosity (AC) and intrinsic motivation focuses on basic concepts and theory. Experimental results are generally limited to toy scenarios, such as navigation in a simulated maze, or control of a simple mechanical system with one or two degrees of freedom. To study AC in a more realistic setting, we embody a curious agent in the complex iCub humanoid robot. Our novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework consists of a state-of-the-art, low-level, reactive control layer, which controls the iCub while respecting constraints, and a high-level curious agent, which explores the iCub's state-action space through information gain maximization, learning a world model from experience, controlling the actual iCub hardware in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ever embodied, curious agent for real-time motion planning on a humanoid. We demonstrate that it can learn compact Markov models to represent large regions of the iCub's configuration space, and that the iCub explores intelligently, showing interest in its physical constraints as well as in objects it finds in its environment.","Frank, Mikhail and Leitner, Juregen and Stollenga, Marijn and Foerster, Alexander and Schmidhuber, Juergen",0,10.3389/fnbot.2013.00025,1005
1400,"Motivations, Achievements, and Challenges of Self-Directed Informal Learners in Open Educational Environments and MOOCs","This research targeted the learning preferences, goals and motivations, achievements, challenges, and possibilities for life change of self-directed online learners enrolled in a massive open online course (MOOC) related to online teaching hosted by Blackboard using CourseSites. Data collection included a 40-item survey, of which 159 MOOC respondents completed the close-ended survey items and 49 completed the 15 open-ended survey items. Across the data, it is clear that self-directed online learners are internally motivated and appreciate the freedom to learn and the choice that open educational resources provide. People were also motivated to learn informally from personal curiosity and interest as well as professional growth needs and goals for self-improvement. Identity as a learner was positively impacted by informal online learning pursuits. Foreign language skills as well as global, cultural, historical, environmental, and health-related information were among the most desired by the survey respondents. The main obstacles to informal online learning were time, costs associated with technology use, difficulty of use, and lack of quality. Qualitative results, embedded in the findings, indicate that self-directed learners take great pleasure in knowing that they do not have to rely on others for their learning needs. Implications for instructional designers are offered.","Bonk, Curtis J and Lee, Mimi Miyoung",0,,1006

1403,The river and the sea: fieldwork in human ecology and ethnobiology,"This article is a commentary on the experiences that motivated my decision to become a human ecologist and ethnobiologist. These experiences include the pleasure of studying and of having the sense of being within nature, as well as the curiosity towards understanding the world and minds of local people. In particular, such understanding could be driven by addressing the challenging questions that originate in the interactions of such individuals with their natural surroundings. I have been particularly interested in the sea and the riverine forests that are inhabited by coastal or riverine small-scale fishers. Sharing the distinctive world of these fishers enjoyably incited my curiosity and challenged me to understand why fishers and their families 'do as they do' for their livelihoods including their beliefs. This challenge involved understanding the rationality (or the arguments or views) that underlies the decisions these individuals make in their interaction with nature. This curiosity was fundamental to my career choice, as were a number of reading interests. These reading interests included political economy and philosophy; evolution and sociobiology; evolutionary, human, and cultural ecology; cultural transmission; fisheries; local knowledge; ecological economics; and, naturally, ethnobiology.","Begossi, A",0,10.1186/1746-4269-10-70,1009

1405,Process Account of Curiosity and Interest: A Reward-Learning Perspective,"Previous studies suggested roles for curiosity and interest in knowledge acquisition and exploration, but there has been a long-standing debate about how to define these concepts and whether they are related or different. In this paper, we address the definition issue by arguing that there is inherent difficulty in defining curiosity and interest, because both curiosity and interest are naive concepts, which are not supposed to have a priori scientific definitions. We present a reward-learning framework of autonomous knowledge acquisition and use this framework to illustrate the importance of process account as an alternative to advance our understanding of curiosity and interest without being troubled by their definitions. The framework centers on the role of rewarding experience associated with knowledge acquisition and learning and posits that the acquisition of new knowledge strengthens the value of further information. Critically, we argue that curiosity and interest are the concepts that they subjectively construe through this knowledge-acquisition process. Finally, we discuss the implications of the reward-learning framework for education and empirical research in educational psychology.","Murayama, Kou and FitzGibbon, Lily and Sakaki, Michiko",0,10.1007/s10648-019-09499-9,1011
1406,Attention--Continued [Part 3],"This lesson, originally written for a class of teachers, continues further the exploration of attention. In the last lesson, I said that there are two kinds of attention--involuntary and voluntary; that we attend involuntarily when the subject attended to attracts us in and of itself; voluntarily when we perceive the relation which the thing attended to has to some subject of intrinsic interest. Interest is the source of involuntary attention, and voluntary attention, to be of much educational value must pass into involuntary attention. Realizing the feebleness of the curiosity of children, you will not expect from it any sustained efforts. You will be satisfied if you can make it a means of getting them to think a little, and learn a little, being sure that in this way you can lay the foundation for a deeper curiosity, and with this impulse to work with, you can get them to think more closely and acquire more knowledge. When you are dealing with older pupils you should make a different use of the principle of curiosity. I have been talking, for the most part, about how to awaken an interest--the condition of involuntary attention; but you should also know how to get the voluntary attention of your pupils.

Post-graduate students of Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (UPM) and teachers of Deutsche Schule Madrid (DSM) have constructed a small wind tunnel. The main goal has been to provide a tool for secondary school students to become familiar with the scientific method developing curiosity, imagination, initiative, critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Students of DSM have performed wind tunnel experiments, resulting in a successful and amusing experience. The students were able to relate the experimental results obtained with the physic principle of flight, previously explained in class. Evaluations reveal that both, the teacher and the students, considered the experience as interesting and helpful to lead with teaching physics, mathematics and engineering sciences. The teacher observed the strong motivation factor developed for the students to continue learning engineering sciences. Some of the students expressed that this experience had changed their prejudices about physics and mathematics, based only on theoretical approaches.","Le Clainche, S and Schlapkohl, M and Theofilis, V and Wei, H and Tendero, J A and Liu, Q and Perez, J M",0,,1013

This intrinsic interest in novelty and complexity is termed curiosity and can be harnessed to motivate learning to read. Teachers must learn to recognize the preferred level of arousal of each child as well as the level at which he functions most effectively. They must control the irrelevant and distracting properties of the environment in order to gain and maintain the attention of the child. Finally they must become skilled at introducing the learning materials in a manner which will maintain a constant flow of interesting stimulation.

1411,Inquiry-based learning: Reconciling the personal with the public in a democratic and archaeological pedagogy,"This article describes and explores the key elements of an approach to personalised learning which is rooted in student experience and choice. It is shaped by the learner's interest, driven by her curiosity and purpose, yet is capable of supporting the delivery of the valued outcomes of a publicly accountable curriculum. It is an approach which enables a student to participate purposefully in the processes of learning, developing values, attitudes and dispositions for learning, while at the same time acquiring and managing specialist knowledge, skills and understanding in the service of a personally chosen outcome. The journey begins with a particular, concrete place or object, and moves through a developmental sequence of thinking and learning capabilities to a publicly evaluated outcome. It is a pedagogy which integrally supports citizenship education because it addresses questions of value and worth through the narratives uncovered in the world-as-it-is-experienced by the learner. It is an archaeological pedagogy in the sense that it begins with experience and observation, generates narratives and then reconstructs knowledge/s necessary to satisfy the original personally chosen quest, rather than beginning with pre-packaged conceptual expert knowledge. It creates a context for critical subjectivity and engagement with learning and with the world. It is a pedagogy which takes seriously the selfhood of the learner, and the formation of virtue in learning, while at the same time not abandoning the rigour of specialist knowledge in a particular field. <c2><a9> 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Crick, R D",0,10.1080/09585170902764021,1016

1413,Critical review on the existence of transgenerational entrepreneurship in tourism businesses: Current trend and interest,"Tourism, one of Malaysia's fastest growing economic sector, has created many business opportunities, the majority of which are family-controlled businesses. New ventures are started by founders who will eventually invite their relatives, especially as successors for their businesses. Nowadays, a successful family business is not determined by traditional methods alone such as profit, assets, or capital, but also take into account survivability or entrepreneurship transmission between generations. Unfortunately, entrepreneurship researchers have not fully embraced tourism because of the prevailing assumption that tourism is a just regular business. Both tourism and transgenerational entreprenership fields employ empirical studies to justify their idiosyncrasies but remain separate from each other. If studied together, it would lead to better understanding of both fields and would even spark the curiosity of researchers to investigate family relationships in conglomerate tourism businesses. Further research into this mixture of fields will also provide a conceptual economic model for tourism destination development bodies that will enhance and promote local community entrepreneurship.","Puzi, M A M and Ismail, H N",0,,1018
1414,The effects of orienting activity and social structure on cognitive processing,"This study investigated the effect of varying the type of orienting activity and instructional social structure on prior knowledge recall, epistemic curiosity, and recall and application of newly acquired information after a seven day interval. A 2 (orienting activity) x 2 (social structure) factorial experimental design was employed. Four sections of a college level Anatomy and Physiology course were randomly assigned to the four experimental conditions. Eighty-four subjects participated in an orienting activity consisting of reviewing either a problem-based situation or instructional objectives. The subjects were further divided into one of two instructional social structures, a small group discussion or individual study. The findings showed a significant main effect for type of social structure (p<.05) on interest, delayed recall, and delayed application test. In all cases, the individual study condition performed better than the small group study condition. Neither the problem-based situation nor the instructional objectives resulted in significant differences on any of the measured dependent variables. Two-way interactions were found. Subjects in small groups who received objectives as the orienting activity scored significantly better on the prior knowledge recall and the delayed open-ended application test than those who received problem scenarios as the orienting activity. Orienting activity did not have a differential effect on these measures in the individual study condition. These findings call into question the practice of using problem scenarios combined with small group discussion as a means of stimulating prior knowledge recall and application of newly-acquired information.

1421,An Attention Model for Museum Exhibits,"A qualitative study determined which factors in the museum exhibit environment or within the museum visitor may influence the visitor to attend an exhibit. Observations and interviews were conducted of 14 groups that visited a Chesapeake & Ohio steam locomotive at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. An inductive or grounded theory approach was used to analyze the data. Interest and relevance were motivational prerequisites for attention and influenced the visitor to attend the exhibit. The interest and relevance factors within the visitor could be categorized as enduring personal interest, curiosity, and connections to personal history. Group influence and the interesting nature of the exhibit, both external to the visitor, also influenced visitor attention. These findings provided some evidence to support the hypothesis that the attention model for museum exhibits is a plausible explanation about how visitors pay attention in a museum. The attention model was a viable replacement for the ""hook"" in the Csikszentmihalyi and Hermanson model. It was able to describe the visits of specialized groups and the visits of a more general family/social group. People visiting the locomotive exhibit did not attend in the same way but the model had the flexibility and power to describe motivation to attention in each case.

In Study 1 (N = 372) relationships between measures of dispositional Interest- (I) and Deprivation- (D) type curiosity, ambiguity tolerance (AT), and negative affectivity were examined. Consistent with the wanting-liking model, AT correlated positively with I-type curiosity and negatively with D-type curiosity. Also as predicted, I-type curiosity correlated negatively with negative traits, D-type curiosity correlated positively, and AT had minimal relationships. In Study 2 (N = 158), correlations between trait I- and D-type curiosity and need for closure (NFC) were examined. Generally consistent with expectations, I-type curiosity correlated negatively with NFC, and D-type curiosity was related positively, although the relationships were very weak.

1424,INTRODUCING COMPUTATIONAL THINKING TO 7TH AND 8TH GRADERS,"The millennial students registering at the university are skilled at using technology for entertainment and fact finding. But, the necessary curiosity to know the workings of the technology and the ability to utilize it productively seem to be lacking. Mentoring at high-school presents the same dilemma. The foundations needed to investigate, explore, and develop problem-solving with computation is seen missing. This project was an attempt to jumpstart this process by introducing fundamentals of computation and problem solving using computers to students prior to entering high-school. Additionally, pedagogical techniques taught and used by middle school teachers were used to create activities and sustain interest. In particular the constructionist approach by John Biggs [2] was adopted together with the ideas in ``Self Theories'' [1] professed by Carol Dweck. The curriculum was developed incrementally - in conjunction with the pedagogical techniques learned through the graduate level Middle School Education course. The course comprised fifteen (15) one hour sessions, once per week. The course was delivered using a combination of videos and reflective discussion, current events and relevant articles, short quizzes, demonstration of programming tools and techniques developed for the class, team projects, active classroom participation, and student presentation. The class comprised of 14 7th and 8th graders; with 8 girls and 6 boys; three teachers and one university professor and an MS student. Various pedagogical techniques learned in the classroom - Selective Readings and Teaching Strategies for Middle School Children - were used to keep student attention, group formations, discussions moderation, and assignment creation. All activities were conducted as a team project or classroom activity. First set of activities involved making the class relevant to student interest and understanding the relevance of technology to all aspects of society. Subsequently, using the Java language and the JEdit interface, students were introduced to computational problem solving first - where the code resembles the output and then code that needs to be interpreted to ensure expected output is achieved. Students learned core values needed to work on computational problem solving. This include soft and hard skills. The curriculum was developed on the go based on student feedback and hence was quite different than originally envisioned. But this is precisely the constructionist approach and thus was most effective from the students' point of view. Students also learned the need and use of soft skills and skills from various disciplines to creatively deliver useful products and technologies. A surprising side-effect was that the school teachers participating in the project got motivated and interested in computing. The participating teachers - science and social studies teachers - were motivated to learn software development and participated extensively in the process. We thus achieved in-service teacher training. This may be the better approach to teacher training.","Iyengar, S",0,,1023

1427,The Italian legal model outside of Europe: Japan,"This paper analyses the influence of the Italian legal model on the modern Japanese legal system. The paper is divided in three parts. In the first, it analyses the formative period of modern Japanese law, when foreign influences on Japanese law have been very strong. The Italian influence was, apart some notable exceptions, quite limited. The second part takes into consideration the 1900s, when Japanese jurisprudence almost overlooked the Italian legal model. The last part presents the years from the 1990s until today: in this period it is possible to notice an increased interest in the Italian legal system. This study evidences an example of path dependency in the dynamics related to the reception of foreign models in Japan, at least until the 1990s. The profound shocks that affected the Japanese society in the early 1990s stimulated a reassessment of the role of the law in the Japanese society and legal reform in many areas.

Madame du Chatelet and himself were at once absorbed in labors, literary and legal, scientific and metaphysical, dramatic and historical. The reader may imagine that such a disturbed, tumultuous life, so far from books and conveniences, must have been detrimental to an author's proper work. It would have been to that of most men; but Voltaire was, as the King of Prussia remarked, extraordinary in everything. These interruptions may have saved him. He never worked more successfully than during this Brussels lawsuit period, from 1739 to 1745; and so he thought himself. ""I have never,"" he wrote to Cideville in January, 1740, when he was in the full tide of his 'Mahomet', ""been so inspired by my gods, or so possessed by my demons. I know not if the last efforts I have made are those of a fire about to be extinguished."" The play was given in May, 1741. In another play he had been working on, ""Merope"", he ventured to dispense with the passion of love, and to depend for the interest of the drama upon maternal affection. It was accepted and put in rehearsal, the author himself superintending. The play was represented February 20, 1743. Various circumstances had inflamed public curiosity respecting it. ""Merope,"" the most finished and evenly excellent of all Voltaire's tragedies, made also the most thrilling and triumphant first-night of his whole experience as a dramatic author. Its success with the audience was everything that the most sanguine and exacting writer could have anticipated. But this fine tragedy did not open to its author the doors of the French Academy.

1435,Review of Autonomy and rigid character,"Reviews the book, Autonomy and Rigid Character by David Shapiro (1981). Contemporary thought and research in psychology are heavily saturated with curiosity about the self. There is heightened interest in such matters as the origins of self-regarding attitudes, the effects of focusing attention upon oneself as compared to nonself objects, and the manner in which self-structures serve as selective lenses. The literature teems with topics like narcissism, self-concept, mirror effects, and ego boundaries. Shapiro's book is really an essay about the nature of selfhood. It explores the problems of becoming an independent self and the desperate maneuvers that individuals may resort to in an effort to patch up rents in that abode. To be more specific, Shapiro addresses two issues. First, he explores the degree to which we are actually in charge of ourselves. Second, he outlines the presumed consequences of attempting to defend one's self-territory too rigidly. Shapiro conceptualizes the average individual's life space too narrowly and rigidly. He is too quick to impose standards of what is healthy or unhealthy. He too easily falls back on a theoretically derived mythic concept of the average environment that fails to take into account its natural vastness.

The locus of religious thought has shifted in the twentieth century from Europe to the United States, and the present religious revival is distinguished from earlier ones by the activity of a significant number of first-rate intellectuals contributing to a renewed theology and a fresh philosophy of religion. Neo-orthodoxy among theologians, ecumenicalism among churches, and a religious curiosity on all levels are major aspects of the contemporary situation. The reinvigoration of theology now underway in the United States represents a confluence of many streams of religious thought: an existential idealism begun in Europe; the philosophical and ethical lessons of Plato, Aristotle, and the classic Stoics; a concept of creative dialogue with the world, society, and culture springing from nineteenth-century liberalism; the demythologizing of the Scriptures; an approach to dogmatics which does not dismiss philosophical issues; and an insistence upon an ethic which is Christocentric, theologically oriented, and biblically grounded but also relevant to the situation of the contemporary individual.<e2><80><94>Ed. <c2><a9> 1960, Sage Publications.

1443,Empowerment for continuous agent-environment systems,"This article develops generalizations of empowerment to continuous states. Empowerment is a recently introduced information-theoretic quantity motivated by hypotheses about the efficiency of the sensorimotor loop in biological organisms, but also from considerations stemming from curiosity-driven learning. Empowerment measures, for agent-environment systems with stochastic transitions, how much influence an agent has on its environment, but only that influence that can be sensed by the agent sensors. It is an information-theoretic generalization of joint controllability (influence on environment) and observability (measurement by sensors) of the environment by the agent, both controllability and observability being usually defined in control theory as the dimensionality of the control/observation spaces. Earlier work has shown that empowerment has various interesting and relevant properties, for example, it allows us to identify salient states using only the dynamics, and it can act as intrinsic reward without requiring an external reward. However, in this previous work empowerment was limited to the case of small-scale and discrete domains and furthermore state transition probabilities were assumed to be known. The goal of this article is to extend empowerment to the significantly more important and relevant case of continuous vector-valued state spaces and initially unknown state transition probabilities. The continuous state space is addressed by Monte Carlo approximation; the unknown transitions are addressed by model learning and prediction for which we apply Gaussian processes regression with iterated forecasting. In a number of well-known continuous control tasks we examine the dynamics induced by empowerment and include an application to exploration and online model learning.","Jung, Tobias and Polani, Daniel and Stone, Peter",0,10.1177/1059712310392389,1034

1445,The magic of cinemagraphs: Investigation of different image formats in online product presentation,"A cinemagraph is a special type of animation characterized by the contrast and coexistence of motion and stillness due to artificial manipulation. Cinemagraphs have attracted visual artists and marketers and have been widely used in online marketing campaigns. However, the effects of cinemagraphs in online product presentations require further examination. This study plans to examine the potential effects of cinemagraphs in online product presentations by comparing them with photographs and short animations. In addition, we aimed to examine the visual processing of cinemagraphs using eye-tracking technology. Drawing on the competition for attention theory, the attention-guiding principle, and incongruity theories of curiosity, we hypothesize that these different image formats have different effects on human visual attention and product interest. We then propose a laboratory experiment to test our hypotheses. Finally, potential theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed. <c2><a9> International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.","Xiaoyu, M and Jiang, Z J",0,,1036
1446,Cultivating an Entrepreneurial Mindset in an Undergraduate Engineering Statistics Course Using Project-based Learning,"There is resurging interest in the engineering education community in entrepreneurial activities and the development of an entrepreneurial mindset (EM). According to the KERN Entrepreneurship Education Network, facets of an EM include curiosity, an emphasis on creating value, and the ability to make connections. While extracurricular activities are the primary mechanism by which this topic has been introduced to engineering students in the past, it is beginning to show up in more formal ways. The literature includes examples many of how to promote entrepreneurship and an EM in traditional project-based courses engineering students take (senior design, etc.); but there are fewer examples and best practices for cultivating an EM in a fundamental engineering course-namely engineering statistics. Project-based learning (PBL) is a pedagogical approach that involves active learning directed at investigating and solving complex, real-world problems- and it is an approach that is underutilized in math-intensive engineering courses. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate how PBL can be integrated into an undergraduate engineering statistics course to promote an entrepreneurial mindset and investigate its impact on student learning. Six teams of engineering students in a 200-level engineering statistics courses responded to the challenge of presenting ``A World Without Statistics''. Teams were given liberty to choose any topic of interest and received funding to support their idea. The resulting projects creatively conveyed what the world would be like without statistics using a myriad of topics: sports, resilient infrastructure, online data, robotics, artificial intelligence, and manufacturing. Evidence suggest that curiosity, an emphasis on understanding the value of statistics, and the ability to make connections were critical to each team's success. This paper provides an overview of the assignment, and examples of students' work. Such insights have the potential to not only influence the way we cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset in fundamental engineering courses, but also shed light on innovative ways to integrate other multi-faceted topics in engineering education.","Vignola, Cladio and London, Jeremi and Ayala, Richard and Huang, Wen",0,,1037
1447,Phenomenology of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Methodologically Structured Overview,"A methodological order is derived from the concept of phenomena and stages of understanding are developed according to Karl Jaspers. The three levels of descriptive, genetic and hermeneutic understanding are applied to the study of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Descriptive understanding essentially reveals a sense of incompleteness and depersonalization that underlies the experience of the nonsense of obsessive thoughts and that obsessive-compulsive symptoms do not come to an end. Genetic understanding shows particularly by reference to the trigger situation that sensitivity, undifferentiated affects, affective hyperarousal and traumatization are important aspects in the development and maintenance of the obsessive-compulsive disorder. Hermeneutic understanding brings to light the fear of death in obsessive-compulsive disorder as its anthropological dimension. The aim of this methodologically structured overview is to focus on the experience of the obsessive-compulsive patient, to keep curiosity and interest alive, so that both research and relationship to the patient is stimulated. <c2><a9> 2019 S.

1448,Multiple Outcomes of Class Visits to Natural History Museums: The Students' View,"The purpose of this study was to describe and understand the range of outcomes of class visits to natural history museums. The theoretical framework is based on the multifaceted process of learning in free choice learning environments, and emphasizes the unique and individual learning experience in museum settings. The study's significance is in highlighting several possible cognitive as well as non-cognitive learning effects in museums class visits, by providing the student's point of view. Data was collected by semi-structured interviews with 50 students in grades 6-8 on the day following the visit. We present evidence that students expressed several learning outcomes, connected directly and indirectly to the scientific content of the visit. Content oriented outcomes included acquiring scientific knowledge and making connections to prior knowledge; social oriented outcomes were identified in students' statements regarding communicating knowledge and social aspects of learning; and interest oriented outcomes were evidenced by students' expressions about emotions, interest and curiosity. The aggregate data addressed the common outcomes and the impact of class visits to natural history museums in the short term. Comparisons between two types of museums show significant differences in several aspects, regarding the exhibit and/or the activity type. Practical ideas for structuring the ultimate experience are included.","Bamberger, Yael and Tal, Tali",0,10.1007/s10956-008-9097-3,1039

1450,Curiosity and exploration: Facilitating positive subjective experiences and personal growth opportunities,"In an effort to expand research on curiosity, we elaborate on a theoretical model that informs research on the design of a new measure and the nomological network of curiosity. Curiosity was conceptualized as a positive emotional-motivational system associated with the recognition, pursuit, and self-regulation of novelty and challenge. Using 5 independent samples, we developed the Curiosity and Exploration Inventory (CEI) comprising 2 dimensions: exploration (appetitive strivings for novelty and challenge) and absorption (full engagement in specific activities). The CEI has good psychometric properties, is relatively unaffected by socially desirable responding, is relatively independent from positive affect, and has a nomological network consistent with our theoretical framework. Predicated on our personal growth facilitation model, we discuss the potential role of curiosity in advancing understanding of various psychological phenomena.","Kashdan, Todd B. and Rose, Paul and Fincham, Frank D.",0,10.1207/s15327752jpa8203_05,1041
1451,"""I'm Taking Notes."" Reactive Analysis of Doing Ethnography in a Child Care Program","This essay is a history of the process of completing an ethnographic study in a child care setting. It presents reflections on entering the field site, keeping field notes, and analyzing data. An exploratory study of a group of preschool children led to the selection of qualitative methods and clarified the theoretical basis for research. In completing the formal study, triangulated methods of participant observation, interviewing, and record and contextual analysis were used. The use of ethnomethodology to explore events themselves led to a dual analysis of theoretical propositions and empirical data in which theory provided a frame of reference for conducting field study and observation-based findings led to theoretical reorganization. These methods proved to be appropriate for the setting and for the sociological data collected. The role of participant-as-observer was manageable by adopting a passive attitude as adult-without-authority. The children responded to the presence of a researcher with mild curiosity. Their level of interest was evaluated reactively at the conclusion of observation. The analysis of data proceeded steadily through three phases and culminated in the full description of typologies and strategies used by the preschool children. The interpretive process of ethnographic methodology was valuable in constructing detailed, contextual information about children's everyday social behavior. (Author/RH)","Munro, Joyce Huth",0,,1042

1454,"Review of Drugs, society and the law","Reviews the book, Drugs, Society and the Law by Harvey Teff (1975). This book examines the interrelationship that exists between law as a dynamic social process, a problem that has occupied the attention of sociologists, lawyers, and legislators for much of the twentieth century. The author is concerned with developing an answer to the question: What is the legitimate function of the law in such matters as the sale and possession of drugs? He indicates that the extent to which a government deems it desirable to impose legal sanctions will depend to a great extent on value judgments as to what constitutes harmful behavior and as to the accept ability of using the law as a means of regulating it. Teff concludes that illegality intensifies curiosity and accounts for much of the glamour that attaches to the use of particular drugs. The book merits praise because it wisely suggests that the British drug clinics have focused too much of their attention and resources on heroin and cocaine misuse and too little on the phenomenon of poly-drug abuse. The book should be of interest to sociologists, political scientists, lawyers, drug abuse specialists, policy formulators, and all persons who are concerned with the interrelationships that exist between a complex social problem and the political response that is made to it.

1455,Mindfulness and performance,"Mindfulness and other forms of meditative practices have been of interest to elite performers, coaches, and psychologists interested in enhancing performance since the publication of Eugen Herrigel's (1953) Zen and the Art of Archery in the middle of the 20th century. This interest in mindfulness practices within sport and performance psychology remained by and large a curiosity fueled by the occasional popular book, such as professional basketball coach Phil Jackson's text entitled Sacred Hoops: Spiritual Lessons of a Hardwood Warrior, where it was suggested that optimal athletic performance could perhaps be better enhanced by the cultivation of mindful awareness rather than mindless aggression. Despite these rare sport-related acknowledgments in the popular media, the tendency from the 1950s into the early 2000s was for the scientific community within sport psychology to dismiss meditative approaches as somehow ""mystical"" and nonscientific, even following a 1985 conference presentation by Kabat-Zinn and colleagues on a meditation based mental training program for elite rowers. Yet, after clinical psychology began effortfully investigating mindfulness theory, examining its constructs, and incorporating it into practice in the 1990s, the view of mindfulness and meditative practices started to change within sport psychology as well. Around the turn of the 21st century, mindfulness-based interventions found their way into mainstream sport psychological science and practice, largely spearheaded by the development of the Mindfulness-Acceptance-Commitment (MAC) approach to performance enhancement. In just over a decade, significant and important developments with regard to mindfulnessbased interventions in sport psychology have emerged. Yet as in clinical psychology within which mindfulness-based approaches first took hold, the growth and adoption of mindfulness practice into mainstream sport psychology have required consideration of basic definition and conceptual understanding. As such, w'e follow' with a discussion of how' mindfulness may be conceptualized and then tie the discussion back into how mindfulness-based approaches can be of assistance in the sport and performance psychology domains.

1457,QUEST: A Model Transfer Program and Evaluation of QUEST Program,"These reports describe and evaluate Illinois Central College's Quality Undergraduate Education for Student Transfers (QUEST) program. The core of the program is to develop in students 15 competencies identified as essential to an educated person: communication skills, mathematics skills, appreciation of physical well-being, understanding of the natural world, understanding of our society, understanding of technology, understanding of our cultural heritage, information-gathering skills, critical thinking skills, effective group interaction, self-examination/self-worth, tolerance and social responsibility, leadership, intellectual curiosity, and an individual value system. All of the competencies are taught across the curriculum, but seven are also the focus of specific courses. The program emphasizes active modes of teaching and learning, including small group work, study groups, independent study, and open-ended assignments. The program seeks to foster the sense that students belong to a community of learning, through a mentor program, an orientation program, assessments of students' talents and interests, cultural activities, and service to the community. The descriptive report discusses the 15 competencies, teaching methods, and the development of a community of learning. The evaluative report considers program costs and revenue, enrollments, retention rates, academic performance, and responses to a student survey regarding QUEST and its effect on their academic life. Appendixes present the results of high school counselor interviews; results of a faculty survey; QUEST faculty meeting notes; a survey of sophomore QUEST students; a summary of pre- and post-assessments of learning; and a QUEST manual.

1458,Recruiting psychosocial health effects of animals for families and communities: Transition to practice,"The positive psychosocial effects of human/animal relationships engage our interest, based on our firsthand experiences with pet animals and our scientific curiosity, as well as practical questions concerning how best to include pets as an adjunct for treatment for a child with autism or a veteran with paraplegia or to enhance the quality of life of an elderly person in an assisted-living facility. The application of human/animal relationships in offering psychological supports for various types of vulnerable people has been expanding. One profound change is the therapeutic roles for their handlers of assistance dogs' and emotional support animals (ESAs). Providing emotional comfort for handlers with disabilities, ESAs need not be trained to perform specific tasks, and they are allowed only limited public access, differing from assistance dogs. Early uses of assistance dogs focused on utilitarian tasks, aiding those with visual, hearing, or ambulatory disabilities; now, their provision of psychologically therapeutic benefits, contact comfort, or as a social lubricant is also highly valued. Between 2000 and 2010, California registrations of assistance dogs have shifted toward uses for psychiatric, medical, and emotional needs of their handlers, and uses of dogs with small body size have increased dramatically to exceed the large dogs registered in 2009. Thus, the differences among ESAs, animals used in animal-assisted interventions (AAls), and assistance dogs, and even companion animals, are ambiguous. Here, we define the roles of animals used to foster human health and then review the research-based information about the benefits of pets, especially for the most vulnerable people, and we address the practical therapeutic implementations.

1465,Why Are They Better Students when They Come Back? Determinants of Academic Focusing Gains in the Study Abroad Experience,"International educators in general, and study abroad advisors in particular, have recognized for many years that United States college students returning from studying abroad show positive changes. According to their impressionistic perceptions, international educators often identify improvements in terms of concern about international affairs, appreciation of different cultures, maturation, self-awareness and independence. Much of the research literature on the impact of study abroad on US college students coincides with those impressionistic perceptions and finds that participants in study abroad programs acquire global-mindedness, grow intellectually, and develop personally. When researchers find no evidence of gains on the part of study abroad students, they acknowledge that their samples are too small to detect statistical significance. Research has also identified various kinds of second language acquisition gains--especially in listening and comprehension abilities--for students who study abroad in non-English speaking countries. With few exceptions, academic impacts other than linguistic ones have not been dealt with extensively in the research literature on gains from studying abroad. Many faculty and study abroad advisors who chat with their students returning from study abroad experiences will recognize that one of the most noticeable changes in these students is a higher than average curiosity and interest in academic matters. As they become more interested in academic issues, participants are less often distracted by non-academic, age-related stimuli. Some educators refer to this process as a sign of maturation, and rightly so. The issue, though, is to find out whether (and how) studying abroad contributes to this process of academically-oriented maturation. This article explores the cluster of experiences that participants in study abroad go through--both during their sojourn abroad and immediately upon return--and how these experiences enhance shifts in their individual priorities. The author discusses to what extent, and why, some study abroad participants bring their academic endeavors to the forefront of their interests when they return to their home colleges. Since the experiences of study abroad program participants are many, eye opening, and quite complex, this article also explores the intricate and multiple determinations of the changes in the participants. With the help of multiple regression and path analyses the author lays out a model that charts those changes, their consequences, and mutual determinations.

By this reason, and in the sociocultural context of the epoch, it can be understood the Cajal's interest for the hypnosis. He was informed about all the contributions led to end in his time -from the observations of Charcot, the french doctor, with hysterical patients in the hospital of the Salpetriere, up to the research results of Liebeault and Bernheim, between others. It was during his stay in Valencia -from 1883 to 1887-, and given the curiosity and passion that the topic was causing, when he managed to organize something similar to a psychological cabinet for which all kinds of people passed. In his autobiography he reports how in this period, and for distraction of his teaching and laboratory labors, he devoted himself to the experimental study of the hypnosis. He talks with his friends, some of them fellows at the Casino of the Agricultura, and they organize a Committee of psychological investigations. It is in his own house where he and his friends, mentally healthy persons, offer themselves to be hypnotized. Also Silveria Fananas, his wife, was among those who collaborated in the experiments of suggestion. Occupying already the chair of Barcelona, and being pregnant his wife of the sixth of their sons, the occasion appears to apply the hypnotic suggestion to diminish the physical pain. This experimental essay was published by Ramon y Cajal, August 31, 1889, in the Gaceta Medica Catalana. Later on, in 1924, he will include it again in a summary of selected articles.

1473,The Prediction of Intrinsic Motivation among Early Adolescents: A Mediational Model Involving Self-Esteem and Strain,"Maintaining an intrinsic motivation for school work is considered to be an important element in keeping adolescents in school and out of trouble. Recent research has begun to study factors that contribute to the development of an intrinsic interest in school learning. Two such important factors are self-esteem and the stressfulness of the school environment. The study reported in this paper tested a model that hypothesizes that intrinsic motivation is affected directly by perceived strain related to school and self-esteem. In addition, it is hypothesized that self-esteem mediates the effect of strain on intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is operationalized as a preference for academic challenge, high curiosity in school work, and an independent approach to mastery of the academic environment. Results from 84 seventh-grade middle school students provided strong support for the hypothesized model. The clear associations among strain, self-esteem, and intrinsic motivation suggest that a middle school environment that minimizes strain and enhances early adolescent self-esteem can increase a student's motivation to learn and may reap additional benefits of reducing dropout rates and promoting lifelong learning.

1474,â€œSuperluminalâ€ Pulse Propagation Dynamics,"With the recent rediscovery of slow- and fast-light effects, there has been much interest in pulse propagation phenomena that lead to apparently superluminal pulse transmission. This raises immediate questions about causality and special relativity violations and elicits curiosity about the physical mechanisms responsible for these effects. This thesis will address these issues theoretically and experimentally by investigating two such effects. The first effect we consider is pulse propagation under conditions of negative group velocity in erbium-doped fiber. Predictions suggest that upon propagation through a region of negative group velocity the transmitted pulse exits the region before the peak of the incident pulse enters. In addition, theory predicts the presence of a peak within the region that propagates backwards, linking the incident and transmitted peaks. We determine the accuracy of these predictions experimentally and uncover the physical mechanism that leads to the effect. We also examine the saturation of photonic tunneling delays with barrier opacity, which is known as the Hartman effect. In particular we address the case of frustrated-total-internal-reflection, which is a two-dimensional tunneling effect. Theoretical treatments of this phenomenon have been limited to special cases in the past. We demonstrate a new method of decomposition that gives a continuous expression for the predicted delay, and present experimental measurements of that delay in a barrier structure constructed from glass prisms and a liquid crystal cell.","Gehring, George M",0,,1059
1475,Anthropomorphic interpretations and ethological descriptions of dog and cat behavior by lay people,"Unlike ethologists and veterinarians, lay people supposedly use their own unstructured observations to interpret their companion animals' behavior, often in anthropomorphic terms. Recently, anthropomorphism has evoked new interest amongst scientists as a result of provocative publications concerning ""animal mind,"" that have prompted investigations in the field of cognitive ethology, and much speculation about the emotions of animals. The purpose of the research reported here was to determine the concurrency and plausibility of anthropomorphic interpretations and ethological descriptions of dog and cat behavior and facial expressions, taking into account the observer's experience with the companion animal species. Independent sets of pet owners and non-owners (n=128) were presented with selected still photographs and edited video sequences to interpret, first spontaneously, then in a multiple choice mode. These were programmed on an interactive CD-Rom. Nested ANOVA showed that the choice of different kinds of multiple choice answers was influenced by their level of plausibility, by the personal experience which the people had had with the species, and by the species shown in stills or movie sequences. Scenes which were interpreted with high agreement of over-80% either showed key elements, a consummately act, or the context in which the behavior took place. They generally represented scenes relevant to the relationship between an owner and an animal. The facial expressions of ""fear"" and ""curiosity"" in dog scenes and ""stress"" in cat scenes were also interpreted with agreement of over 80%.","Bahlig-Pieren, Z and Turner, D C",0,10.2752/089279399787000075,1060
1478,Location based point-of-interest recommendation system using co-pear similarity measure,"A new recommendation strategy is proposed to enhance the location-based point of interest (POI). The POIs such as Four square, Gowall a create a curiosity to share their experience and location which they visited. This Recommendation system seems to know everything about the people's interests, passions and stays up to date with modern trends. The POIs recommendation is based on the past check-in activities of the user. The user can<e2><80><99>t review the rating of any new cities which he/she doesn<e2><80><99>t check-in. Even though the collaborative filtering (CF) possess numerous advantages but it suffers from some disadvantages also. It can<e2><80><99>t predict any new (items, users), if the product or users aren<e2><80><99>t in the training then it can<e2><80><99>t be embedded in the query thus it creates a cold start problem. To overcome this problem, we introduced a Hybrid Co-pear Collaborative Filtering algorithm integrated into the POIs system. The combination of Cosine and Pearson similarity measures develop the multimodal hybrid method. To upgrade this system, we added a pear review analysis technique that analyses the location and provides valuable information to the new user. The simi larity measure is taking place by modifying the data into the vector. During the comparison, we can precisely detect the angle variation between any two non-zero vectors. The cold start problem is overcome and represents a better recommendation for the new users. User GPS trajectories is utilized to calculate the latitude and longitude of the users location from Geo-life dataset. The result showed a variation among the existing and proposed location recommendations and proved that the proposed system provides an optimum solution to the new users. <c2><a9> IJSTR 2019.","Vinodha, R and Parvathi, R",0,,1061
1480,Intrinsic and Extrinsic Science: A Dialectic of Scientific Fame,"In this article, I argue that scientific fame and impact exists on a continuum from the mundane to the transformative/revolutionary. Ideally, one achieves fame and impact in science by synthesizing two extreme career prototypes: intrinsic and extrinsic research. The former is guided by interest, curiosity, passion, gut, and intuition for important untapped topics. The latter is guided by money, grants, and/or what is being published in top-tier journals. Assessment of fame and impact in science ultimately rests on productivity (publication) and some variation of its impact (citations). In addition to those traditional measures of impact, there are some relatively new metrics (e.g., the h index and altmetrics). If psychology is to achieve consensual cumulative progress and better rates of replication, I propose that upcoming psychologists would do well to understand that success is not equal to fame and that individual career success is not necessarily the same as disciplinary success. Finally, if one is to have a successful and perhaps even famous career in psychological science, a good strategy would be to synthesize intrinsic and extrinsic motives for one's research.","Feist, Gregory J",0,10.1177/1745691616660535,1062
1481,"Designing with differences, cross-disciplinary collaboration in transport infrastructure planning and design","The study explores enablers and barriers of collaborative planning and design work in transport infrastructure planning projects, drawing upon five cases of projects in Sweden. The study apply a set of theoretical lenses complied of previous research focusing professional knowledge and co-production in planning and design practices, and research revolving around the concept of boundary objects in studies of collaborative work. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of practitioners' learning across professional boundaries: what they learn from each other, how they learn, and how the learning facilitates collaborative work. The results show that disciplinary barriers can be bridged through both individual efforts and project management strategies. This study shed light a set of enablers on individual level including; 1) a capacity to change focus between solving tasks within the remit of one's own discipline and jointly solving tasks together with professionals representing other disciplines; 2) curiosity and interest other professional perspectives; 3) willingness to learn from other professionals; and 4) motivation to engage in cross-disciplinary design processes. Project management is proposed to enable collaboration by; 1) opening up discussions about reasons and motives for collaborative work; 2) opening up discussions about strategies for collaborative processes; 3) promoting and facilitating learning processes among project participants, 4) coordinating meetings and activities for collaboration, and 5) facilitating deliberative dialogues at project meetings in which different types of knowledge can be put forth and interrelated. <c2><a9> 2020 The Author(s)","LÃ¶fgren, S",0,10.1016/j.trip.2020.100106,1063
1482,Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation Learning Processes: Why Japanese Can't Speak English,"Motivation towards English learning in Japanese schools today is analyzed according to John Condry and James Chambers' process-of-learning paradigm. The four stages of learning (initial engagement, process, disengagement, and re-engagement) are shown to emit different processes of learning in students based on whether learning is intrinsically or extrinsically motivated. Intrinsic learning motivation involves an inner desire to learn a more integrated set of skills stimulated by personal interest and curiosity. Such students tend to use more of the available English language information and are more involved in the process of learning. Extrinsically motivated students are focused on achieving the external reward, which in this case is proficiency in English on entrance examinations for higher education institutions. The emphasis is on the end product of education. Here, students tend to short-cut the learning process, use less information, and develop fewer learning strategies. Edward Deci's Cognitive Evaluation Theory is presented to show how the intrinsic motivation context changes to the extrinsic context when rewards are administered for activities that were originally intrinsic. Some suggestions are offered on how guided classroom learning may be stimulated by intrinsically motivated tasks. (Author/MSE)","Kamada, Laurel Diane",0,,1064
1483,Non-cognitive abilities of exceptional software engineers: A delphi study,"Important building blocks of software engineering concepts are without a doubt technical. During the last decade, research and practical interest for non-technicalities has grown, revealing the building blocks to be various skills and abilities beside pure technical knowledge. Multiple attempts to categorise these blocks have been made, but so far little international studies have been performed that identify skills by asking experts from both the industrial and academic world: which abilities are needed for a developer to excel in the software engineering industry? To answer this question, we performed a Delphi study, inviting 36 experts from 11 different countries world-wide, affiliated with 21 internationally renowned institutions. This study presents the 55 identified and ranked skills as classified in four major areas: communicative skills (empathy, actively listening, etc.), collaborative skills (sharing responsibility, learning from each other, etc.), problem solving skills (verifying assumptions, solution-oriented thinking, etc.), and personal skills (curiosity, being open to ideas, etc.), of which a comparison has been made between opinions of technical experts, business experts, and academics. We hope this work inspires educators and practitioners to adjust their training programs, mitigating the gap between the industry and the academic world. <c2><a9> 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

1484,Against the Bureaucratization of Criticism,"The proliferation of critics and critical approaches has produced a trend toward fragmentation and isolation among the practitioners involved. A suggestive counter-trend indicates that there is intense curiosity among critics to watch colleagues encounter texts, grapple with the preliminary questions of stance and method, and share the experience of criticism as encounters with a text. Preoccupation with reflection on critical methods and stances usually occurs at the expense of the understanding of the critical experience that occurs prior to such reflection. An apt metaphor--the bureaucrat--describes this state of affairs because a bureaucrat's first duty is to perpetuate the rules and regulations of a solidified bureaucracy. How can scholars strike a balance between the habits and inclinations of the critic and the autonomy of the text, without resorting to a bureaucracy of method, especially when pressures from academia work to maintain this bureaucracy? A way is needed to remove methodological formalism from its central role in critical practice, without obliterating the importance of critical rigor in the process, so that the experience and interpretation of texts can return to main stage in criticism. For change to occur, it must begin at the individual level, with individual acts of rebellion against the bureaucracy. Ultimately, critics must realize that the experience of criticism is itself fundamentally anti-bureaucratic. What makes criticism interesting is the collision between a text, with all of its own tradition and context, and a critic, with all of his or her interests, intuitions, commitments, and curiosity.

1490,Young children's emergent science competencies in family and school contexts: A case study,"To address the lack of research in early science learning and on young children<e2><80><99>s informal science experiences, this 6-month long case study investigated an 8-year-old boy's emergent science competencies and his science experiences in family and school contexts. The four research questions used to guide this investigation were: (1) What are Nathan<e2><80><99>s emergent science competencies? (2) What are Nathan<e2><80><99>s science experiences in a family context? How does family learning contribute to his emergent science competencies? (3) What are Nathan<e2><80><99>s science experiences in school? How does school learning contribute to his emergent science competencies? (4) What is the role of parents and teachers in fostering emergent science competencies? My intensive 6-month fieldwork generated multiple data sources including field notes of 12 classroom observations, one parent interview, eight child interviews, one classroom teacher interview, and observation of eight family produced videos. In addition, I collected a parent journal including 38 entries of the child's how and why questions, a child digital photo journal including 15 entries of when Nathan saw or participated in science, and 25 various documents of work completed in the classroom. First, I analyzed data through an on-going and recursive process. Then, I applied several cycles of open coding to compare and contrast science learning between home and school, establish clear links between research questions and data, and form categories. Finally, I applied a cycle of holistic coding to categorized data that eventually culminated into themes. As a method of quality control, I shared my interpretations with the family and classroom teacher throughout the study. Findings revealed, Nathan<e2><80><99>s pre-scientific views of science were fluid and playful, he saw differences between the science he did at home and that he did in school, but he was able to articulate a relatively complex understanding of scientists<e2><80><99> collaborative efforts. Nathan's emergent science competencies were a result of his experiences both in the home and classroom. His science experiences at home often involved engaging in conversation with his parents about the world around him and was driven by the things he was interested in or wondered about. He enjoyed daily family activities like cooking, playing, and building models with his dad. These experiences contributed to his naive conceptions of science. By contrast, his science experiences in school were also collaborative but less facilitated by Mrs. Young. His wide range of experiences at home and in the classroom illustrated that doing, learning, knowing, and demonstrating knowledge are intertwined and not easily distinguished from each other. Nathan's emergent science competencies were fueled by a child-environment loop. The child-environment loop is a concept that captures the reciprocal nature between a child's curiosities and his or her environment. As his curiosities were met, new questions and activity were produced. As a result, Nathan's activity continually influenced the environment in which his emergent science competencies emerged. Likewise, the changing environment contributed to new curiosities, interest, and science competencies. Findings extend current research of informal science learning by illustrating how family learning contributed to a child's naive scientific views through the development of non-spontaneous concepts. Findings also extend current research by illustrating how a child with a solid foundation of spontaneous concepts might be unable to further develop non-spontaneous concepts in a classroom where learning took a similar form (working with others and talking about ideas) as learning in the classroom was less mediated. Main implications of this project include a call for research and practice to more aggressively contribute to a learning progressions approach to provide a map of educational opportunities that neither under- or overestimate children<e2><80><99>s ability. Curriculum ought to view naive science conceptions developed in family learning as a necessary element in the learning continuum rather than a deficit in science knowledge to contend with during the development of non-spontaneous concepts in classroom learning to achieve this goal. Finally, to extract meaningful experiences from inquiry-based science learning, teachers need to incorporate students' naive science conceptions by explicitly connecting everyday family learning to science through disciplinary engagement where inquiry is mediated.","Andrews, Kathryn Jean",0,,1068
1491,Elementary School Mathematics: What Parents Should Know About... Problem Solving,"The influence a parent has on the beginning educational development of a child is unquestionable and profound; a parent's attitude and interest will greatly influence a child's attitude toward and interest in learning. This pamphlet is designed to help parents become aware of the many opportunities to develop, nurture, and refine their child's mathematics skills and to participate in the child's learning process. The first section discusses the nature of problem solving in mathematics and lists four characteristics of good problem solvers: (1) ability to identify important skills; (2) flexibility of thinking; (3) perseverance; and (4) a sense of knowing what is reasonable. General guidelines to help parents develop their child's problem solving ability are outlined in the next section. These include emphasizing the importance of problem solving and the enjoyment and self-satisfaction derived from it, taking advantage of the child's curiosity about numbers and shapes, helping the child become aware of the thinking used in problem solving, and spending time with the child on a regular basis working on solving a variety of problems. Various exercises are suggested to develop problem solving experiences, including a 10-step problem solving poster. Answers to problems and suggested resource materials are provided.

1494,The power of story for motivating adaptive responseâ€“marshaling individual and collective initiative to create more resilient and sustainable food systems,"What can environmental scientists and teachers do to make our food system more resilient in times of rapid change and food system failures? One low-cost and high-impact way is to encourage people to tell their stories of food and farming. Stories are one way we navigate complexity, and our food system is increasingly complex. Facilitating individuals and groups to talk about their experiences and direct observations is a powerful tool to help people understand their role in the food system. As each individual makes his or her own personal story explicit, they begin to listen to the stories of others and see how their daily choices shape the system. People are then in a position to better understand complexity and make conscious choices that support resilience and systemic change. We offer three cases in different contexts that illustrate how anyone can facilitate an adaptive response and what outcomes could be expected. The first case involves discussion of agricultural ethics in a children<e2><80><99>s classroom setting. The second shares experience of apple growers who wanted to reduce pesticide risk but were thwarted by the management complexity. The third case brought together business leaders interested in making regional food systems more resilient. In these cases, narratives based on personal experience helped people understand their role as a central actor in the food system and make them conscious of their responsibility for the health of the system. It encouraged their curiosity and interest in specific questions that scientific inquiry could address. Storytelling empowered people to act individually and collectively to make the food system more resilient within their spheres of influence and built the skills necessary for effective civic engagement on complex systemic issues. <c2><a9> 2015, AESS.","Miller, M and Solin, J",0,10.1007/s13412-015-0332-y,1071

A theoretical model for curiosity, interest and engagement in new media technology-pervasive learning environments is advanced, taking into consideration personal, situational and contextual factors as influencing variables. While the path associated with curiosity, interest, and engagement during learning and research has remained essentially the same, how individuals tackle research and information-seeking tasks and factors which sustain such efforts have changed. Learning modalities for promoting this theoretical model are discussed leading to a series of recommendations for future research.

1498,Getting to the Heart of a Story,"While many teachers teach comprehension strategies by concentrating on isolated skills, often in the form of worksheet drills, comprehension is actually an active, constructive process that occurs before, during and after reading a particular selection. In order to comprehend reading material, readers must merge the knowledge they already own, often referred to as prior knowledge, with the information they are reading. When students link new information to prior knowledge, their interest and curiosity are motivated. While identifying noteworthy information in nonfiction texts is relatively easy for most students, particularly if the text is well-structured, students often have difficulty identifying the themes in fictional selections. Yet, the theme is the heart of a story. The author describes one tool she uses to help her students activate prior knowledge, set a purpose for reading and identify a story's themes. She uses an Anticipation Guide. This organizer guides students to reflect on carefully constructed statements that will help them link their prior knowledge and preconceived ideas to the information they will read. In addition to setting a purpose for reading, the Anticipation Guide also promotes interest and encourages higher-level thinking. Also included is a guide so that teachers can create their own Anticipation Guides.","Mitchell, Karen E",0,,1075

1501,Seeking Common Ground: Surveying the Theoretical and Empirical Landscapes for Curiosity and Interest,"My purpose in this commentary was to seek out any common ground that might be found for theory and research on curiosity and interest as detailed by the contributors to this special issue. Despite the numerous differences that these authors demarcated, several areas of concurrence were readily identified. Those seven areas are, thus, specified and summarized. This commentary then concludes with the forwarding of three questions intended to provoke curiosity or fuel the interest of those engaged in research on these two complex and challenging constructs and their various manifestations. In framing my commentary to this thought-provoking special issue, Curiosity and Interest: Conceptual Distinctions, Relations, and Implications for Educational Practice, I set out to map the common ground that those investigating curiosity or interest occupied. This is what Wilson (1998) described as a search for consilience or unity of knowledge.

An inventory of 1686 lists eighty-one scythe blades at the Tower of London (by 1694 described as booty captured from the Duke of Monmouth's rebels at Sedgemoor) and the surviving pair was probably among them. The Duke's shortage of standard-issue equipment made improvisation essential, and the choice of re-hafted scythe blades owed to their widespread, well known and effective use by irregular forces in Britain and Europe since the late Middle Ages. Monmouth's 'sithmen', some hundreds strong, took part in skirmishes and in the battle of Sedgemoor itself. Of interest to the Tower authorities as curiosities and for their propaganda value, the scythe blades were displayed, in diminishing numbers, from the seventeenth until the nineteenth century, and these two until the 1990s.

Why has the Project Approach proven to be so successful for engaging young children intellectually and supporting their capacities to think, predict, hypothesize, reason, and express their natural curiosity? Simply put, because project work provides meaningful contexts in which children can readily apply and perceive the usefulness of their growing academic skills. This book provides a brief history and overview of the Project Approach and a thorough explanation of how to better use this method proficiently in a wide range of educational contexts. This book is intended for teachers, early childhood practitioners, caregivers, and student teachers. Readers will learn how to apply this approach to engage children's interest and facilitate their intellectual development. The book's chapters articulate the processes and benefits of the Project Approach, identify and detail the three phases of project work, and provide specific suggestions for implementing each phase. The importance of documenting children's work to record the story of their investigation and findings is also discussed. Features of the book include: Presents the philosophical, theoretical, and research bases of project work that serve to explain how the Project Approach enables children to make better, more in-depth and accurate sense of their experiences and phenomena in their everyday environment; Includes descriptions of numerous projects implemented with children in a wide variety of settings to guide teachers through developing their own successful projects with children; and Provides a comprehensively updated new edition of the well-known standard book on the Project Approach.

1515,Review of Appointment with the wise old dog: Dream images in a time of crisis,"Reviews the DVD, Appointment with the Wise Old Dog: Dream Images in a Time of Crisis by David Blum, Rustin Thompson, David Blum and Sarah Blum (1998). Simply and directly told through paintings and narration, Appointment with the Wise Old Dog is a treasure, an unsentimental and factual documentation of one man's intimate experience of dying. Profound with layers of symbolism, the film invites interpretation. It resonates with universal psychological and theological themes, metaphors, and archetypes. If I had to choose, a favorite motif in the film would be the aura of Mairi's love shimmering through the oil pastel, giving the film the look and feel of an illuminated manuscript. Blum's grief of impending separation from his beloved wife across the existential divide is mitigated by Mairi's all-encompassing love and timelessness. The toy dog Alfonto is not only an ally in the dream story but also a transitional object in real life, as is the film as a whole. But more than intellectual stimulation and curiosity, it is its sheer artistry and enveloping mystery that impels me to watch the film again and again with fascination and awe. Art therapists, Jungian therapists, and practitioners working in medical, aging, and death and dying settings will find this film of immense interest. It is provides compelling testimony of the capacity of art to bridge worlds, both rational and irrational. From the brief opening statement by cellist Yo-Yo Ma to its last images, the film quietly and profoundly draws us into an aura of trust, that we may in turn trust our inner resources in times of need. David Blum and his cast of mythical characters not only tell us about ""meeting death with some measure of equality"" but also remind us how to live, in creativity and in grace.

1517,"Firestone and Robertson: ""make mine a double!""","Case Description: The Spirits industry is one of the fastest expanding industries in the United States, and Leonard Firestone and Troy Robertson wanted to become a successful part of that industry. There are only 250 micro-distillers in the United States (www.360westmagazine.com). From Fort Worth, Texas, Firestone and Robertson had been friends for a few years, but never knew the other had the same dream about getting into the business of distillation. Each followed his dream to an artisan craft distillery in Kentucky to learn how to establish a business model within the industry and to learn how to distill some of the best bourbon ever tasted. As one of the distillery directors was talking with Robertson, he noted that another fellow from Fort Worth was scheduled to go through the distillery the next week, and he also mentioned that he knew Robertson. The case unfolds to a crescendo of demand for a blended whiskey that is not yet on the liquor store shelves. The lists of names of people waiting to get a call letting them know that the whiskey has arrived are long. All of ""cow town"" is ready to wet their whistles with a flavor that is purely great-tasting and founded in Texas. So many people want the product that before all the bottles can be bought to be filled, the creators of the brew fear that they will never be able to keep up with production. When they consider that they have at least one other product aging in the oak barrels, they are over whelmed by constant demand for their products. Students will have a natural interest in the case because there is just something intriguing about how the best whiskey and bourbon is made. Couple this curiosity with the elements that build equity for the brand before it even hits the shelves, and you have an exciting dilemma of everyone loving the product, and not enough product to meet demand. This could be a good problem to have, yet the students will be challenged to determine lead time for production, especially with the pure bourbon, and marketing dollars to support the rapid growth of the new product. If ever there was a star in the Boston Consulting Group matrix, it is TX blended whiskey. And, it comes with all the benefits and draw-backs of a true BCG star. There is enough material here for discussion of the entire matrix. Case Synopsis: ""Make mine a double!"" really describes the character of the case. Since Firestone & Robertson Distilling Company started business in 2010 as the only artisanal bourbon whiskey distillery in North Texas, the waiting lines for their products have doubled, the production capacity has doubled, and the advertising budget has doubled. People in the North Texas area are drawn to the unique strand of yeast that is available only in the Firestone and Robertson whiskey. They hired an artisan who knew the original process for developing strains of yeast. As head distiller, he collected over 100 samples of yeast from fruits, nuts and soils native to North Texas. Eventually, he isolated a single strain found in a pecan tree nut grown near Glen Rose, Texas that was suitable for the fermentation of the bourbon and provided the specific flavor and aroma profiles Firestone and Robertson wanted. As they prepare to roll out the first bottles of blended whiskey, they are faced with addressing demand as it increases. They want to keep people wanting the product and not turn away customers. This situation doubles the problems they anticipated when starting their dream. The case that follows presents more of what makes their products unique, and challenges management and marketing student guru's to map a path from Fort Worth to everywhere while holding true to budget.","Kahla, M C and Crocker, R M",0,,1085
1518,Creative Education for Gifted Children,"Creativity is an essential attribute for the development of creative potential. However, it is not always developed properly in the school context, especially when it is about gifted students education. Because these children need a specialized service to attend their special needs. In this sense, this study aims to contribute in order that education professionals reflect and become aware of the importance of creativity in education. The method of this research was based on national and international studies which focused on the area of High Abilities/Giftedness and creativity in the school context. The conclusion is that the development of creativity depends on a good teacher education in preparing activities that arouse curiosity and interest of each gifted, enabling the student creative and independent, investigative and critical thinking. Furthermore, teachers should provide new opportunities of reflection on the process of teaching and learning.","Piske, Fernanda Hellen Ribeiro and Stoltz, Tania and Machado, Jarci",0,,1086
1519,Discovering inner strength during chaos: The impact of children diagnosed with mental disabilities on parental caregivers,"This phenomenological study examined the personal experiences of parental caregivers, whose school-aged children have been diagnosed with mental retardation or chronic illness, for the identification of their perceptions of inner strengths discovered while providing care. Ten parental caregivers from the National Alliance on Mental Illness in the Tri-Valley, an Alameda County, California support community, participated in a semi-structured, in-depth interview that explored their experiences of caring for their children. Afterward, data was analyzed through open and axial coding; member, peer, and cross-checking techniques; and reflective journaling. Although care giving experiences varied significantly, a common experiential theme of the following character strengths emerged among those who were attempting to cope successfully with the high stress levels of caring for a child with a severe mental illness: optimism, patience, humor, love, perception, equality, previous experience, education, support, spirituality, positive self-esteem, advocacy, compassion, gratitude, curiosity, coping skills, values, grieving, acceptance, interest, deflection, perseverance, rationalization, isolation, communication, faith, hope, intuition, reflection, repression, sympathy, depersonalization, intellectualization, empathy, intellect, sublimation, and wisdom. Data derived from these interviews were clustered into 16 of 24 character strengths associated with life satisfaction (Seligman, Steen, Park, and Peterson, 2005). It is the author's hope that this study will add to the body of knowledge that advocates for strength-based orientations, which could significantly increase the effectiveness of a family psychoeducation program and decrease the emotional distress of families living with mental illness.

In the course of their own professional practice, the authors have often felt the need for a comprehensive reference based upon current material. It was this scarcity which first inspired the authors to attempt such a work. The authors feel there exists a genuine need for literature dealing with modern concepts of psychosexual pathology. This book as will be observed, consists of case-histories of patients whom the authors treated in the course of their private practice of psychoanalysis. A specific attempt has been made to disguise the identity of each patient to assure complete anonymity. In the presentation of the cases particular stress has been placed on the psychodynamics of each sexual deviation. None of the case-material is borrowed. It is hoped moreover that the data presented herein, in the light of clinical research, will help the reader to develop a scientific appreciation of the ""sexual deviate"" who veritably is a sick individual blind to the true cause of his sexual affliction and in tragic need of psychiatric assistance.

1522,The diverse reasons for using Novel Psychoactive Substances - a qualitative study of the users' own perspectives,"Background: The increasing number of legally ambiguous and precarious Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS) constitutes a challenge for policy makers and public health. Scientific and more in-depth knowledge about the motivations for using NPS is scarce and often consist of predetermined, non-systematic, or poorly described reasons deduced from top-down approaches. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore and characterize the users' self-reported reasons for NPS use inductively and more comprehensively. Methods: The self-reported reasons of a self-selected sample of 613 international NPS users were collected via an online survey promoted at the international drug discussion forum bluelight.org and later analyzed qualitatively using inductive thematic analysis. Results: The analysis showed that the participants used NPS because these compounds reportedly: 1) enabled safer and more convenient drug use, 2) satisfied a curiosity and interest about the effects, 3) facilitated a novel and exciting adventure, 4) promoted self-exploration and personal growth, 5) functioned as coping agents, 6) enhanced abilities and performance, 7) fostered social bonding and belonging, and 8) acted as a means for recreation and pleasure. The consumption of NPS was also driven by 9) problematic and unintentional use. Conclusion: The present study contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of the users' own and self-reported reasons for using NPS, which needs to be acknowledged not only in order to minimize drug related harm and drug user alienation but also to improve prevention efforts and reduce the potentially counter-intuitive effects of strictly prohibitive policies.

1523,Psychoanalysis and the future of education,"The analyst is a passive, impartial observer, while the teacher is forced to be an active personal influence. Hence the value of psychoanalysis for the teacher lies in giving him an appreciation of human instincts and an understanding of how to apply this knowledge in meeting pedagogical problems. In the question of sexual enlightenment, teaching and psychoanalysis converge fundamentally. The author illustrates this point by reporting his experiences in answering the questions of a seven-year-old boy. The questions may be classified as simple questions of interest and as questions representing anxiety. At first, the questions showed a desire for general information, but later there was revealed in a disguised fashion an intense sexual curiosity. The author then elaborates upon the significance of childish questions in expressing definite personality trends, phases of development, and libido tensions which need to be recognized and met if the inquiring child is to develop properly. Only by virtue of the profound knowledge of psychoanalytic concepts can the teacher hope to understand and to meet adequately the profound problems presented to him in the guise of superficial questions by his charges.

1525,Science of magic; a literature review of ancient dialogue and new synergies between illusionism and psychology,"Illusionism has been used for centuries as an artistic instrument according to laws of great psychological interest. Primarily, magic tricks work because cognitive and emotional aspects are susceptible to manipulation. In fact, reality is not experienced by individuals as such, but is the result of the construction actively conducted by the brain. The art of magic is based on the action of the intrinsic properties of the mind and that of magicians-like crooks and cheaters-they are in fact experts in cognitive science that are able to cleverly manipulate the perception of reality. Prestidigitation originated as a secret discipline requiring complex learning so much so that even today, despite recent vulgarization through the internet, mastering this art is not so much as knowing the tricks but the perseverance in their studies, curiosity in experimentation of mind and the particular way of thought. Illusion has its own laws regarding function it is exceptional and unique, depending on the background of the individual which in part is shared by other people. Towards the end of the nineteenth century many scholars were occupied in scientific studies of the psychological aspects of prestidigitation, in various cases involving famous magicians of that time. In the last decade neurosciences have been interested in studying the mental mechanisms involved in magic with the aim of identifying unknown psychological mechanisms thanks to spontaneous experiments offered by magic and illusionism. This text illustrates the basic elements of psychology that is linked with illusionism so as to try and understand the potential contribution it can offer to neuroscience. The theme of illusion is also analyzed in the evolution of the epistemological paradigm in which includes the relationship between therapist and patient. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Italian) L'illusionismo e impiegato da secoli come strumento artistico secondo regole di grande interesse psicologico. I trucchi magici funzionano fondamentalmente perche gli aspetti cognitivi ed emotivi sono suscettibili di manipolazione. La realta non e vissuta infatti dagli individui come tale ma e il risultato di un'attivita di costruzione svolta attivamente nel cervello. L'arte della magia e basata sull'azione su proprieta intrinseche della mente e i prestigiatori-come i truffatori e i bari-sono di fatto degli esperti di scienze cognitive che sanno manipolare abilmente la percezione della realta. La prestidigitazione ha origine come disciplina segreta che richiede un apprendimento complesso e anche oggi, nonostante una sua recente volgarizzazione attraverso internet, padroneggiare quest'arte non consiste tanto o soltanto nel conoscerne i trucchi ma richiede costanza nello studio, curiosita nella sperimentazione e particolari modalita di pensiero. L'illusione ha le sue regole di funzionamento in parte singolari e che dipendono dalla storia del singolo individuo, in parte condivise da tutti gli esseri umani. Gia alla fine dell'Ottocento vari studiosi si erano occupati dello studio scientifico degli aspetti psicologici della prestidigitazione, coinvolgendo in vari casi famosi illusionisti dell'epoca. Nell'ultimo decennio le neuroscienze si sono interessate a studiare i meccanismi mentali coinvolti nella magia con l'obiettivo di identificare meccanismi psicologici sconosciuti grazie agli esperimenti spontanei offerti da magia e illusionismo. In questo testo sono illustrati i fondamenti psicologici dell'illusionismo ed i possibili contributi che lo studio di essi puo offrire alle neuroscienze. Il tema dell'illusione e analizzato anche all'interno dell'evoluzione del paradigma epistemologico in cui e compresa la relazione tra psicoterapeuta e paziente.

1533,FROM LEARNING TO TEACHING LAB EXPERIENCE,"How is changing the mind of young students before enrolling at the university related to their future work as a laboratory teacher? The answer presented in this article explains, step by step, our experiences. At the beginning, as secondary school students (seventeen years old) we could enrol in a biochemistry summer course. When High School classes were finished, University and Biochemistry laboratories were open for us. There we were to deal with an absolutely new environment; our first experience in the University which years after we would finally enrol. In this sense, this experience also helped us in order to choose our future career. Furthermore we got the opportunity to know people who had the same interests and curiosities about science and biochemistry. Some years after, as laboratory teachers in the same summer course, our vocation and passion for science, biochemistry and biosciences, were transmitted to young students. Several new situations were presented to them such as measuring glucose concentration and expressing a protein, thus young students tried to solve them by using a spectrophotometer and transforming bacteria, among other techniques. At the same time, we tried to show them the correct procedures and hazards in a laboratory. Finally, as a laboratory teachers we become conscious of our acquired knowledge and communication skills. In conclusion, young students and laboratory teachers have to share a good relationship because all of them will become future scientists and must be solving new diseases that we still don't know how. These activities get in contact students with the research world.","Hernandez, Xavier and Jose Lopez, Maria and Fernandez-Novell, Josep M",0,,1096

In addition to having natural human curiosity about people, those who do research in personality and adjustment often have practical motivations. The author considers some particular fields to which knowledge of personality and adjustment is being applied currently and to which this knowledge will be applied increasingly in the future. He considers briefly five areas: Personnel selection, group conflict, advertising and merchandising, public health and welfare, and mental hygiene and the clinical setting. In addition, he addresses the question of applying psychological knowledge to one's personal life, since personal needs often initiate one's interest in the fields of personality and adjustment.

1538,Investigating the Chemical Evolution of the Universe via Numerical Simulations: Supernova Dust Destruction and Non-Equilibrium Ionization Chemistry,"The chemical evolution of the Universe is a complicated process with countless facets that define its properties over the course of time. In the early Universe, the metal-free first stars were responsible for originally introducing metals into the pristine gas left over from the Big Bang. Once these metals became prevalent, they forever altered the thermodynamics of the Universe. Understanding precisely where these metals originated, where they end up, and the conditions they experience along the way is of great interest in the astrophysical community. In this work, I have used numerical simulations as a means of understanding two separate phenomena related to the chemical evolution the Universe. The first topic focuses on the question as to whether or not core-collapse supernovae in the high-redshift universe are capable of being <e2><80><9c>dust factories<e2><80><9d> for the production of galactic dust. To achieve this, I carried out idealized simulations of supernova ejecta clouds being impacted by reverse-shock blast waves. By post-processing the results of these simulations, I was able to estimate the amount of dust destruction that would occur due to thermal sputtering. In the most extreme scenarios, simulated with high relative velocities between the shock and the ejecta cloud and high gas metallicities, I find complete destruction for some grains species and only 44% dust mass survival for even the most robust species. This raises the question as to whether or not high-redshift supernova can produce dust masses in sufficient excess of the <e2><88><bc>1 Msun per event required to match observations of high-z galaxies. The second investigation was driven by the desire to find an answer to the missing baryon problem and a curiosity as to the impact that including a full non-equilibrium treatment of ionization chemistry has on simulations of the intergalactic medium. To address these questions, I have helped to develop Dengo, a new software package for solving complex chemical networks. Once this new package was integrated into Enzo, I carried out a set of cosmological simulations that served as both a test of the new solver and a confirmation that non-equilibrium ionization chemistry produces results that are drastically different from those that assume collisional ionization equilibrium. Although my analysis of these simulations is in its early stages, I find that the observable properties of the intergalactic medium change considerably. Continued efforts to run state-of-the-art simulations of the intergalactic medium using Dengo are warranted.","Silvia, Devin W",0,,1100

Here, we examine the alternate possibility that children's individual interest in specific natural categories shapes the words they are likely to learn <e2><80><93> a child who is more interested in animals will learn a new animal name easier relative to a new vehicle name. Two-year-old German-learning children (N<c2><a0>=<c2><a0>39) were exposed to four novel word<e2><80><93>object associations for objects from four different categories. Prior to the word learning task, we measured their interest in the categories that the objects belonged to. Our measure was pupillary change following exposure to familiar objects from these four categories, with increased pupillary change interpreted as increased interest in that category. Children showed more robust learning of word<e2><80><93>object associations from categories they were more interested in relative to categories they were less interested in. We further found that interest in the novel objects themselves influenced learning, with distinct influences of both category interest and object interest on learning.

This provides evidence for the strikingly intuitive possibility that a child who is more interested in animals will learn novel animal names easier than a child who is more interested in vehicles. <c2><a9> 2019 The Authors.

1545,WHEN THE MUSEUM TURNS INTO A MIXED REALITY LAB. AUGMENTED REALITY AND,"Even today, the scientific research of multimedia applied to museum education is almost completely to investigate. In fact, one of the programmatic commitments of the National Center for Museum Education has been to increase the knowledge of teaching equipment used in Italian museums and their relapses(1). Different scientific researches and study in the ``Media Education'' field - see Jenkins(2), Turkle(3), Livingstone(4)- underline that among young people from 6 to 18 years of age the most persuasive and effective tool of communication is represented by the Web and Social Media. In this perspective, the present research sought to structure the Rural Culture Museum of Martina Franca, Italy, (not known and valued in its full educational extent in behalf of the recovery of cultural and identity traditions) as a laboratory, involving a sample of school classes in experimenting the introduction of the Augmented Reality as a learning tool. The Augmented Reality is a technology that allows to add virtual contents to a physical environment, in interactive form and in real time. It is the superposition of levels of information (multimedia and virtual elements, Geo-localized data, etc.) to the real all-days life experience. The elements that ``augment'' the reality can be added through a mobile device, such as a last generation mobile phone (e.g. iPhone or another Android smart-phone), using a personal computer equipped with a web cam, with visual devices (e.g. VR glasses), listening (e.g. earphones) and with manipulation devices (e.g, VR gloves), which add multimedia information to the already perceived reality ``in itself''. The overlap of real and virtual elements creates a ``Mixed Reality''. I start my research from the hypothesis that with the introduction of the Augmented Reality the teaching-learning processes would be more effective(5). In fact, with the integration of virtual contents in a real environment is possible to allow users to have a full immersion and engaging experience(6). As for museum education and historical objects, using a smart-phone or a tablet of last generation with a specific application of AR, (Augmented Reality) focusing the camera of the phone or tablet on the object of interest, it is possible to receive not only its current physical location inside the museum but also a variety of information regarding the history of the object, its features in different periods and its links to the reference culture. This stimulates the curiosity of the visitor who becomes an interactive user(7) thus making the museum a place not only to visit, but a place of laboratory participation. In this perspective, the present research led the Rural Culture Museum of Martina Franca (Italy) to structure itself as a laboratory, by involving 10 classes of primary school, 5 classes involved with device and 5 forming the control group, without device). The total sample involved 295 students; we proceeded by evaluating the learning levels produced by the introduction of the AR technology, by analyzing the resulting data and comparing them with those of the control sample. The final data processing is still in progress.","Fornasari, Alberto",0,,1104
1546,Awaking Interest in Science Learning: Hands-On Photosynthesis Demonstrations Using Elodea canadensis and Spinacia oleracea,"Photosynthesis is a topic that every high school student must learn not only due to its importance to life on earth but because it inspires many other technologies nowadays. The objective is to illustrate hands-on learning activities to teach photosynthesis in an exciting and cost-effective way. It will improve their capacity to acquire the basic concepts as well as go deeper and increase their curiosity by being face to face with the different phenomena. The activity is divided into three experiments where the foci are chlorophyll extraction, plants' oxygen production, and light's intensity effect on photosynthesis. Each one lets the teacher introduce the basic concepts of photosynthesis and reinforce other chemistry practices and concepts. The activity took place in a Costa Rican high school with 15 10th grade students who worked in 3 groups of 5 students each. This one session activity is an integral approach to teach science with the overall purpose of awakening the interest of high school students in the subject through a low cost and versatile set of experiments that could be easily applied to any targeted audience. The collected data shows it achieved this goal.

1547,Learning from Math Circles: Providing Underserved Students of Color with Accessibility to Mathematics Education,"Consistently high minority failure rates in high school and college mathematics, the noticeable decrease in access to mathematics education for our underserved students of color, and this mathematics educator's genuine belief in the global necessity, desirability, and applicability of engaging our youth in learning mathematics through Math Circles, have each prompted the development of this research dissertation. Although this study focuses on the opportunities for mathematics learning that underserved students of color might receive in Math Circles, I acknowledge that there is an ever-increasing interest in student motivation, identity formation, and the relationships encouraged by Math Circle educators, in their attempts to engage these students' intellectual curiosities and to explore challenging mathematics. Of immediate importance is the fate of our underserved students of color, which is why I strongly advocate for investigating Math Circles as one potential strategy for motivating them. The urban Math Circle (consisting largely of students of color) that I studied, focused on the process of discovery and open-ended exploration, and was designed to introduce students to the deeper kinds of mathematical thinking that are invariably absent in most standard curricula. In addition to encountering exciting material far beyond that treated in a regular classroom, students joining this Math Circle had the opportunity to interact with professional mathematicians and educators in an informal setting. The cooperative (rather than competitive) environment of this Math Circle, where challenging mathematical questions were posed, and congenial conversation between students (and between teachers and students) took over, provided a milieu for possible mathematics learning and further success in mathematics for these students of color. Future studies of Math Circles as a means of providing access to math education to underserved students of color could be expanded to include multiple-case studies, i.e., a larger sampling of Math Circles. Triangulation of data across multiple cases might add an even richer level of analysis. If we, as mathematics educators, are to avoid failing our underserved students of color, I believe that we must find ways to provide them with equitable access to mathematics education. Investigating an urban Math Circle committed to promoting mathematics learning by students of color has the potential to inform changes in the way we teach mathematics, changes that can result in improved achievement by students of color and greater equity in mathematics.

1549,The Comparison of Achievements-System Benefits for Free and Paid Online Learning Courses,"Achievements are modern tools enhancing the attractiveness of a game and increasing the rate of its replayability in the eyes of video game players, the target customers of game developers. Achievements system is a sort of a meta-game, a game in a game, a superstructure which is not obligatory for full completion of the game itself. It is represented in video game digital distribution systems or on community web portals by icons with texts describing what to do or simply how to obtain the particular achievement. In addition, it is possible to acquire a special reward for completing the achievement or set of achievements. It motivates players to submit superior performance involving motor skills, logic or wit. Mainly because of these reasons is the involvement of achievements in education beneficial. The e-learning systems will contain a number of achievements for the courses and the enrolled students will be awarded for the accomplishment of the achievements by a special course completion certificate, remarkable personal profile avatars, multimedia material thematically related to the course instructor or the organizing institution etc. A motivation to meet not only the mandatory requirements, but also to support the willingness to dig deeper into the issues of individual courses, aiming at human playfulness, curiosity and desire to collect and assemble, is the main carrier of the Achievements-system based education support method. The aim of this work is to compare the benefits of the Achievements-system usage by free and paid online learning courses measured by the increase of students who successfully completed the course beside those who attended it. The free e-learning courses are suffering from a malady stemming from its very nature - absolutely unlimited accessibility for everyone. The number of the enrolled students is extremely high, it reaches tens of thousands among the most popular courses, but because of the fact that there is no force which makes the students complete the course, except their inner motives, the number of students who complete the course is only a fraction of the original quantity. There is an opposite situation in the area of paid courses. There are much less enrolled students than in free courses, but the percentage of successful course completion is much more positive among others due to the financial pressure. Increased course completion motivation is assumed by the usage of the Achievements-system in both free and paid courses, with more significant increase in the free environment because of the more diversified structure of enrolled students and therefor higher tendency to playfulness, increased interest in the issue or incentive to deeper study of the subject by nonconformist methods. These theoretical assumptions are to be confirmed or disproved by the results of a research after the real deployment of the Achievements-system in the online learning courses in practice.","Kalenda, David",0,,1108
1551,"Career Adapt-Abilities Scale-Italian Form: Psychometric properties and relationships to breadth of interests, quality of life, and perceived barriers","The Career Adapt-Abilities Scale (CAAS)-Italian Form consists of four 6-item scales, which measure concern, control, curiosity, and confidence as psychosocial resources for managing occupational transitions, developmental tasks, and work traumas. The 24-item CAAS-Italian Form is identical to the International Form 2.0. The factor structure was similar to the one computed for combined data from 13 countries. Internal consistency estimate for the four subscale and total scores was good. Concurrent validity evidence was collected on perceived internal and external barriers, breadth of interests, and quality of life. Correlations resulted as predicted and showed adaptability related negatively to perceived barriers and positively to breadth of interests and quality of life. As expected, analyses of variance showed that adolescents with higher adaptability perceive fewer barriers, express a broader range of interests, and report a higher quality of life.

1552,"'East is Red"": A musical barometer for Cultural Revolution politics and culture","This thesis uses ""East is Red"" as a window through which to look at Cultural Revolution politics and culture. By exploring the relationship between politics and music, and by taking into account the history of revolutionary music in China, it demonstrates how ""East is Red"" is both a textual and musical example of how the Cultural Revolution was both a result of and a departure from the Communist Revolution leading up to it. This approach stems from the author's background in music and her interest in how ideology is expressed and taught through art and culture, as well as her curiosity towards the replacement of China's original national anthem with ""East is Red"" during the Cultural Revolution.

1553,A Randomized Clinical Trial of a Postdeployment Parenting Intervention for Service Members and Their Families With Very Young Children,"Objective: Parenting through the deployment cycle presents unique stressors for military families. To date, few evidence-based and military-specific parenting programs are available to support parenting through cycles of deployment separation and reintegration, especially for National Guard/Reserve members. The purpose of this research was to test the efficacy of a parenting program developed specifically to support military families during reintegration. Method: Within 1 year of returning from deployment to Afghanistan or Iraq, 115 service members with very young children were randomly assigned to receive either the Strong Families Strong Forces Parenting Program at baseline or after a 12-week waiting period. Using a home-based modality, service members, at-home parents, and their young child were assessed at baseline, 3 months posttreatment/wait period, and 6 months from baseline. Results: Service member parents in Strong Families evidenced greater reductions in parenting stress and mental health distress relative to those in the waitlist comparison group. Service members with more posttraumatic stress symptoms reported higher levels of perceived parental efficacy in the intervention group than service members in the comparison group. Intervention also resulted in enhanced parental reflective capacity, including increased curiosity and interest in the young child among those in the intervention group relative to comparison. Conclusion: Service member parents and their spouses demonstrated high interest in participating in a postdeployment parenting program targeting families with very young children. Findings point to the feasibility, appeal, and efficacy of Strong Families in this initial trial and suggest promise for implementation in broader military and community service systems.","DeVoe, Ellen R and Paris, Ruth and Emmert-Aronson, Ben and Ross, Abigail and Acker, Michelle",0,10.1037/tra0000196,1111
1554,Girl-on-girl sexuality,"Girls have sex with girls. Such encounters can be meaningful, trivial, pleasurable, shaming, intentional, and accidental. They are lustful and romantic, motivated by desire, by love, by curiosity, and by acceptance. Sex is with a childhood playmate, an adolescent friend, or a young adult romantic partner. It is with one other girl, with multiple girls, or with girls and boys. Yet these assertions are more speculative than empirically verified because investigators have generally ignored the same-sex experiences of girls. One alternative, to generalize from the far more studied sexual experiences of boys, would lead to misunderstanding about the same-sex experiences of girls. Among the questions addressed in this chapter are: Who are the same-sex partners of girls, and what is their relationship? What happens sexually, who initiates it, and who has an orgasm? Why this girl at this point of time? Is the sex wanted, pleasurable, or meaningful? Does it influence her sexual self-perceptions? To answer these questions, I review findings provided by contemporary social and behavioral sciences and by the life stories of 78 US young women (between the ages of 17 and 25 years) I interviewed in previous studies. All young women met the inclusion criterion of claiming physical or romantic interest in same-sex others. The sections of this chapter address the following topics: Girl-Girl Sexual Activities in Childhood; Girl-Girl Sexual Activities in Adolescence; Timing of the First Same-Sex Encounter; The Same-Sex Partner; The Sex Act; Context, Motivation, and Evaluation of the Initial Same-Sex Encounter; and The Impact of Same-Sex Activities. The literature reviewed in this chapter best illustrates what is not yet known but needs to be known about same-sex sexuality among young women (Savin-Williams & Diamond, 2004). The question for a young woman as she sorts through her sexual encounters is whether they have meaning about who she is.

1555,The Need for Second Language Learning,"The need for language programs in schools is strong among gifted students, who need the depth and complexity provided by a world language program. Gifted students can benefit from exposure to global cultures, a deepened emphasis on conceptual learning, and an appreciation of issues that shape today's world. Second language learning carries high interest and a natural connection to another symbol system that can provide high challenge and complexity, two preferences the gifted have for learning. The gifted have advanced vocabularies and love to learn new words and phrases. Second language learning provides the opportunity to learn new words, many of which directly derive from English words. Even more common are the roots and stems of words from other languages. The gifted have inquisitive minds and curiosity about the origin of things. Second language learning of the romance languages, including Spanish, French, Italian, and Latin, can enhance understanding of the history of Western Civilization and, therefore, the basis of today's society. The gifted have complex thinking abilities that are enhanced by linguistic comparative analysis. Gifted learners can enjoy the complexities of the study of a language that has many characteristics similar to English but is also different in its grammatical structure and forms. The gifted have the capacity to make connections among diverse ideas. This trait is best nurtured by the access to ideas from multiple disciplines that allow connections to be made. The study of a second language promotes interdisciplinarity in a variety of ways. Gifted students are capable of beginning formal study of a second language earlier than high school because they typically possess early verbal abilities, have general interest in words and language, often are early readers with advanced English vocabularies, and have a desire to make connections among linguistic patterns.","VanTassel-Baska, Joyce and MacFarlane, Bronwyn and Baska, Ariel",0,,1113
1556,Award-winning authors and illustrators talk about writing and teaching writing,"From interviews with nine award-winning authors and illustrators of informational books, novels and picture books come three themes that are helpful to teachers in supporting students' writing development: (1) students' writing should come from their interests and passions; (2) students need time and opportunity to nurture their curiosity about potential writing topics; and (3) receiving ongoing reader-based feedback gives students a sense of the impact of their writing on readers. The illustrators' and authors' suggestions are particularly important at a time when national and provincial curricula require teachers to teach the technical aspects of writing, such as mastering particular text forms to achieve academic purposes, or conforming to writing conventions. <c2><a9> 2014 International Reading Association.","Stagg Peterson, S",0,10.1002/trtr.1249,1114
1557,CAUSALITY BETWEEN ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH: LITERATURE,"Although the mainstream theory of economic growth pays little (or no) attention to the role of energy in economic growth, during the last two decades there have been a number of papers dealing with the causality between economic growth and energy consumption. Strong interdependence and causality between economic growth and energy consumption is a stylized economic fact, but the existence and direction of causality is still not clearly defined. Broadly speaking, all papers could be divided in two groups. The first one consists of papers that argue that energy is a crucial input of production and a necessary requirement for economic and social development. On the other hand, the other group of papers argued that energy has no significant impact. The lack of consensus on whether economic growth results in energy consumption or is energy consumption the stimulant of economic growth has aroused the curiosity and interest among economists and analysts to investigate the direction of causality between these variables. The results of such studies are often contradictory. This can be explained by different econometric methodologies, different data set and different countries' characteristics. Although new and more sophisticated econometric methods for (better) identification and understanding of causality were developed over the years, an increasing number of published empirical studies regarding interconnectedness of energy consumption and GDP still have inconsistent results. A lack of compliance on what kind of causal relationship actually exists can result in inadequate implementation of appropriate economic and energy policy. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to give an overview of the existing literature with subsequent conclusions and guidelines for future research.","Jakovac, Pavle",0,,1115

1559,Performing the blush: A dramaturgical perspective,"The blush is not only a psychological phenomenon but also a sociological curiosity. Despite being experienced as something intensely personal that evokes individual distress, blushing also has evidently social causes, consequences and functions. As colleagues in this volume have noted, the blush has evolved as an adaptive response unique to humans, who have an awareness of other minds and external perspectives on the self, together with a sensitivity to the social norms and values of the groups to which they belong. It serves a communicative function, signalling regret, apology and appeasement for having transgressed these social rules, which may be triggered by a feeling of shame before the other (Castelfranchi & Poggi, 1990). Such a gesture of role distance, which separates the person from the acts they have committed, indicates his or her adherence to the group<e2><80><99>s shared values; the blush therefore has a restorative function in helping to repair situations of awkward or disrupted interaction (Dijk & de Jong, 2009; see Darby & Harris, Chapter 7, this volume). Moreover, this gesture cannot be faked or controlled, and so reads as an authentic sign of honesty and trustworthiness (Crozier, 2007). Paradoxically, therefore, despite its associations with deviance, shame and negative evaluation, blushing can be read as a prosocial, positive signifier of cooperativeness and commitment to maintaining interaction order (Goffman, 1983). Central to the social meaning of the blush is the notion of self-presentation. Dramaturgical theory, a sociological approach developed by Erving Goffman (1959/1990), identifies this as a motive behind much human behaviour. Social life is compared metaphorically to a theatrical performance, wherein individual actors strive to create particular impressions to the audiences they meet in different situations, using artefactual props, settings and scenery. These performances are given publicly <e2><80><98>frontstage<e2><80><99> but may be contradicted by actors<e2><80><99> private thoughts, feelings and behaviours, which are displayed <e2><80><98>backstage<e2><80><99> as they slip out of character and evaluate their success or otherwise. Actors also work in teams or casts, rehearsing their parts together and devising strategies to keep each other in face so that the show can go on. Not surprisingly, a key focus of interest is on what happens when this goes wrong: when actors fail to communicate the impression they had intended, or audiences remain unconvinced. <c2><a9> Cambridge University Press 2013.","Scott, S",0,10.1017/CBO9781139012850.014,1117

1562,Review of The exceptional brain and how it changed the world,"Reviews the book, The Exceptional Brain and How It Changed the World by Robert M. Kaplan (2011). In his book, Kaplan has chosen to examine the lives of 13 people from the historical record which illustrate either the effects of psychiatric and neurological disorders or postulated brain states on how a person functions, as well as providing two fantasist reconstructions. He has also interspersed potted biography chapters on seven medical pioneers who have contributed to our understanding of some of the major conditions suffered by historical subjects. The Exceptional Brain is at its best when Kaplan is in full flight with curiosity-piquing narrative flair-often reminiscent of a good quality television documentary. The Exceptional Brain was written for the general public, its contents will be of interest to mental health professionals who enjoy partaking of the fruits of an impassioned psychiatrist-cum-bloodhound. The fact that there are 30,000 brain-related books in, or soon to be in, print, did not thwart Kaplan from writing The Exceptional Brain and neither should it thwart any reader who wishes to take an interesting and different look at the brain, not by means of a study of its anatomy, physiology and neurochemistry, but by means of an enthusiastic investigation into the lives of some very well known or disreputable subjects.

1563,Eye movements reveal epistemic curiosity in human observers,"Saccadic (rapid) eye movements are primary means by which humans and non-human primates sample visual information. However, while saccadic decisions are intensively investigated in instrumental contexts where saccades guide subsequent actions, it is largely unknown how they may be influenced by curiosity - the intrinsic desire to learn. While saccades are sensitive to visual novelty and visual surprise, no study has examined their relation to epistemic curiosity - interest in symbolic, semantic information. To investigate this question, we tracked the eye movements of human observers while they read trivia questions and, after a brief delay, were visually given the answer. We show that higher curiosity was associated with earlier anticipatory orienting of gaze toward the answer location without changes in other metrics of saccades or fixations, and that these influences were distinct from those produced by variations in confidence and surprise. Across subjects, the enhancement of anticipatory gaze was correlated with measures of trait curiosity from personality questionnaires. Finally, a machine learning algorithm could predict curiosity in a cross-subject manner, relying primarily on statistical features of the gaze position before the answer onset and independently of covariations in confidence or surprise, suggesting potential practical applications for educational technologies, recommender systems and research in cognitive sciences. With this article, we provide full access to the annotated database allowing readers to reproduce the results.

1565,Observations From First Year Instructors: What We Wish We Knew Before We Began,"In June 2010, we reported to the United States Air Force Academy to teach in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Each of us brought different skill sets, different experiences, and different interests from different jobs in different locations. Yet, throughout our first year we simultaneously observed common stumbling blocks leading to some dilemmas and curiosities. This paper presents some of these common observations from three dissimilar instructors within a contextual framework promoting a learning-centered paradigm and balancing technical syllabus content with real-world ``soft'' skills. It is not our intention to define these observations as ``Tricks of the Trade'' or ``Best Practices,'' although some recommendations are made. Rather, our intent is that these 10 observations will open dialogue in other institutions and departments to collectively address these issues.","Roberts, Marcus L and Deppensmith, Randall and Silva, Ryan Jay",0,,1121
1566,The Impact of Parents and Parenting on Career Development,"Parents have a pervasive and continual influence on their children's career development, beginning with early childhood and continuing as the child progresses through fantasy, exploration, tentative and trial stages of career development, and as the child responds to the question ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" The child's readiness for school--language skills, social competence, and curiosity--almost predetermines the child's success in school and career directions; those who are less ready for school are more likely to lag behind throughout school, with corresponding limits on their later career prospects. By adolescence, children's vocational maturity, as determined by their own estimate of academic verbal and quantitative ability and by their interests and values, is highly related to their choice of occupation and curriculum. Consequently, students during this period should have the opportunity to experience career exploration and decisionmaking, involving their parents, community resources, teachers, and counselors. During all this time, parents have a consistent and pervasive influence on children's career choices, decisions, and plans, through their modeling of standards, expectations, social skills, and self-acceptance. School counselors, therefore, need to collaborate with parents and assist them in improving their effectiveness with their children. Fourteen specific recommendations for parents are provided.

1568,An investigation into the function of the skate electric organ and electric organ discharge,"Skates possess weak electric organs that bear some similarities to the more infamous organs of electric eels and stingrays, and even more similarity to weakly electric gymnotiform and mormyrid freshwater fishes. Skates and other weakly electric fishes differ from those with powerful electric organs in that the discharges emitted from their organs are too weak to act as a predatory tool or defense mechanism. This insight generates curiosity as to what the function of an electric organ might be if not to defend against predator or obtain prey. Weakly electric gymnotiform and mormyrid fishes have received a large majority of research attention to address this consideration. As a result, much is known about the electric organ and electric organ discharge (EOD) of gymnotiform and mormyrid fishes, including their accepted use in electrolocation and electrical communication. One can speculate as to why elasmobranchs are historically understudied in comparison to teleost fishes. However, research that has been conducted over the years on weakly electric teleosts to elucidate the function of their organs lends itself as an example for future research that aims to identify the function of the similarly weak electric organ of skates. This thesis is separated into two chapters. The first is a review that aims to identify areas of potential research interests into determining the role of the skate electric organ. It presents brief summaries of what is known about the weak electric organs of teleosts and compares this information with what little is known about skate electric organs. The most probable function for the skate electric organ is electrical communication, therefore this is the focus of the review. The majority of attention is devoted to skates, whereas teleost research is presented more as an example for future skate research. The second chapter is a morphological study on the electric organ of one skate species in an attempt to identify ontogenetic or gender differences in the organ as a whole or in the individual electrocytes that make up the organ. Justification for this study stems from the areas of needed research identified in Chapter 1. In other words, characterizing morphological differences by gender and maturity status for the skate electric organ is one of many labors required to elucidate its function. The results of this study are discussed in terms of the evidence they provide toward a communication function for the skate electric organ.","Morson, Jason",0,,1123

1570,An Introduction of Epistemology to Business Ethics: A Study of Marketing Middle-Managers,"A vast majority of marketing theory and research has focused on relativism and idealism in order to understand ethical behavior. However, making ethical assessments that in turn influence behavior is much more complicated than it appears. One of the most important developments in contemporary philosophy has been the renewed interest in epistemic virtue. Epistemologists contend that belief is an ethical process that is susceptible to the intellectual virtue or vice of one's own life and personal experiences. Open-mindedness, curiosity, careful thinking, creativity, and intellectual courage are the foundations of epistemic virtues. Closed-mindedness, intellectual overconfidence, unimaginativeness, intellectual conformity, and wishful thinking are among epistemic vices. The purpose of this investigation is to introduce epistemology to marketing ethics by linking it to personal moral philosophies (idealism and relativism) and optimism to explain various ethically challenging organizational behaviors. The items of epistemology were developed and pretested by the lead author of this study. Structural equations (LISREL) analyses found that epistemic virtues and vices are better predictors of ethical behavior than were personal moral philosophies (idealism and relativism), and their influence on mild and severe levels of unethical behaviors was enhanced by the moderator variable, optimism. Implications are designed to develop suggestions for improving ethical behavior in the workplace. <c2><a9> 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Rawwas, M Y A and Arjoon, S and Sidani, Y",0,10.1007/s10551-012-1537-6,1125
1573,Teaching for Quality Learning in Chemistry. Research Report,"In Portugal, the number of students in higher education increased from 80,000 in 1975 to 381,000 in 2000 (a change from 11% to 53% in the age group 18-22), meaning a major change in the diversity of student population with consequences well known and studied in other countries. The teaching of chemistry at the University of Aveiro, for the first-year students of science and engineering, has been subjected to continuous attention to implement quality and student-centred approaches. The work devoted to excellence and deep learning by several authors has been carefully followed and considered. This communication reports research work on chemistry teaching, associated with those developments for first-year students. The work included the design of strategies and the adoption of teaching and learning activities exploring ways to stimulate active learning by improving the quality of classroom interactions. In addition to regular lectures, large classes' teaching based on student-generated questions was explored. In order to improve students' motivation and stimulate their curiosity, conference-lectures were adopted to deal with selected topics of wide scientific, technological and social interest. Quantitative analysis and discussion of selected case studies, together with the organization of laboratory classes based on selected enquiry-based experiments, planned and executed by students, stimulated deep learning processes. A sample of 32 students was followed in the academic year of 2000/01 and the results obtained are here discussed in comparison with those of a sample of 100 students followed in 2001/02. Particular attention was paid to the quality of classroom interactions, the use of questions by students and their views about the course design.","Teixeira-Dias, Jose J C and Pedrosa de Jesus, Helena and Neri de Souza, Francisle and Watts, Mike",0,,1126
1574,Effectiveness of a ``Grass Roots'' Statewide Enrichment Program for Gifted Elementary School Children,"Enrichment programs provide learning opportunities for a broader or deeper examination of curricular or extracurricular topics and are popular in gifted education. Herein, we investigated the effectiveness of a statewide extracurricular enrichment program for gifted elementary school children in Germany. The program implemented a grass roots strategy by which local units developed and offered the enrichment courses, which spanned a broad array of topics. The courses targeted different outcomes, including students' cognitive abilities, school achievement, interests, creativity, self-control, self-concept, and social competencies. We compared third-grade students attending the enrichment program (N =423) with nonattending third-grade students (N = 2,328) by means of a propensity score analysis. Specifically, we controlled for potential selection effects and estimated the average causal effect of the enrichment program for children attending the program. The findings revealed positive program effects on academic achievement but not on the other targeted outcomes.","Golle, Jessika and Zettler, Ingo and Rose, Norman and Trautwein Ulrich and and Hasselhorn, Marcus and Nagengast, Benjamin",0,10.1080/19345747.2017.1402396,1127
1575,STEM summer institute: A model program for stem integration for girls,"Rising concern about America's ability to maintain its competitive position in the global economy has renewed interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education (Chen & Weko 2009). The economy of the United States depends upon engineering and technology advancement; the growth of jobs in the STEM workforce is outpacing overall job growth by 3:1 (Lam, 2011; National Science Board, 2008). If there is such high rate in job growth, why are there so few people, specifically among women and minorities, entering the STEM field? The answer to this question may be found at the root of the problem, K-12 education. Although children are natural engineers, with strong impulses to investigate, construct, create, and share their knowledge with others (Genalo, Bruning, & Adams, 2000), current curricula does not take advantage of their natural curiosity. Therefore, children's ability to analyze, develop, build, and test as engineers and scientists may be stifled in school. K-12 students tend to shy away from engineering fields simply because they have a limited understanding of what engineering is (Jeffers, Safferman, & Safferman, 2004). It does not help that many K-12 teachers have just as limited an understanding of engineering as the students do (Fadali, Robinson, & McNichols, 2000). Unless students have family members or friends who are engineers, they are often never introduced to the field (Abbitt & Carroll, 1993). This chapter describes a 2-week long STEM Summer Institute for Girls (SSI) that focused on engaging rising 9th- and 10th-grade underrepresented girls in STEM through enrichment of their self-efficacy and knowledge of engineering. Data will be presented as to the outcomes of this institute and the degree to which the designers and presenters were effective in increasing girl's self-efficacy in STEM fields. The need for effective role models from science and engineering fields is also discussed.

1576,The aesthetic sentiment; a criticism and an original excursion,"The aesthetic sentiment is the fruit of a conative act. Cognition is of 2 sorts. (1) Practical cognition is prompted by adaptive interest and is purposively selective. (2) Artificial cognition is an end in itself and does not guide conduct; it is dissociatively selective with reference to a dominant selected by the artist and by the ""laws of order specific to beauty."" Aesthetic thinking or appreciation proceeds in difference to the dominance of the super-ordinate member of the art-object, and is concerned with the formal constitutents of rhythm, balance, proportion, and others, subject to the logic of beauty. The logical appeal stirs us to contemplation and interrelation and provides the pleasure of the successful unification of the constitutents of the art-object. General curiosity provides the motivation for artificial cognition and hence for appreciation. Creation arises from a constructive impulse plus general curiosity; creation and appreciation are guided by the same laws of order.

1577,"The Pedagogy of the Heart and the Mind--Cultivating Curiosity and a Love of Learning, Part 1","The cultivation of curiosity and interest in children for their own pleasure and for their place in the world around them is a significant factor in each student's well-being as well as the future of society. Many educators think that schools no longer provide a curriculum that develops curiosity, creativity, and personal interests in young children. The library media specialist's role in the student-centered curriculum can play an important role in nurturing this creative process. Library media specialists need to engage students' hearts and minds in the learning process and emphasize the love of learning through personal interest. The ""AASL Standards for the 21st-Century Learner"" provides a fundamental resource for library media centers because the importance of personal interest is recognized both as a motivational factor and as a means to an end. This two-part article discusses the model used at the Independent Learning Centre Project at Concordia Lutheran College, an Australian K-12 co-educational day and boarding college. In this first part, the author discusses how the applications of the ""AASL Standards for the 21st-Century Learner"" used in the Independent Learning Centre Project can revive the importance of library media centers and the role of the teacher librarian to impact the learning lives of students. The second part of the article, planned for February 2009 publication, will discuss how developing creativity and personal interest in students through the Learning Centre Project can bring about changes, and provide examples of student work.

1578,ENJOYING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING IN PICTURES,"Could we convert a laboratory practical into innovative material capable of arousing public interest? How do you do it? The overall objetives of this work are: a) To disclose rigorous science in an entertaining manner to society, b) To arouse the curiosity of students in the general public of the work done in university departments, c) To increase the knowledge of students of the Science and Technology world. The specific objectives of this work were to combine scientific rigor with playful aspects when introducing new technologies, encourage scientific vocations among young students and introduce new formats and communication styles for education. To answer these questions a multidisciplinary team at the Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena (Spain) selected several scientific experiments presenting them in a fun as well as educational format. It is ``Science and Engineering Pictures''. The format chosen consists of several short digital audio-visual segments (micro spaces), which can be used in a lecture, in educational media, in TV or even in movies. These digital audio-visuals briefly show the development of a laboratory practical, from the initial idea in the laboratory to their transfer to the society and companies. These laboratory exercises belong to various degrees such as Chemical, Industrial, Telecommunications and Agronomic Engineering. Each micro-space lasts about 5-10 minutes and the intention is to promote a new style of educational audio-visual communication and scientific culture. This audio-visual shows traditional content in an innovative way and provides new formulas in line with new audiences and possibilities offered by new information technologies and communication, helping to promote scientific and engineering knowledge.","Moreno, J I and Aguayo, E and Leon, G and Legaz-Mellado, M J",0,,1131
1580,Radiolab and parasites: Podcasting horror and wonder to foster interest in science,"Podcasts-digital media content you can download from the Internet-offer a novel means to communicate science. Radiolab, a one-hour radio broadcast from WYNC and NPR that is available online, employs creative narrative to communicate science to a general public. Episodes organize around a theme and loosely address scientific questions with an interdisciplinary approach. Thus far, the majority of rhetorical analyses regarding science popularizations have been limited to textual works. This chapter will evaluate the strategies used to popularize science in text versus podcast by comparing the popular science book Parasite Rex (Zimmer, 2000) to Radiolab's episode Parasites (2009b). I find that both sources employ strategies articulated by Fahnestock (1986) and Myers (1990), including wonder appeal and narratives of nature. However, Radiolab's audio production privileges emotional appeals to horror and wonder over scientific content to make the case for parasites and invoke curiosity. Listener feedback left on Radiolab's blog supports the success of emotional appeals to generate interest in science. These findings complicate foundational works in the rhetoric of science by challenging the idea that science popularizations primarily exist to relay factual scientific information to its audience.

1581,The recollection of pleasant and of unpleasant odors,"Examined whether odors judged to be pleasant as opposed to unpleasant were more likely to be recalled. The author remarks that in some of the studies of affective memory the agreeable and disagreeable experiences to be recalled have not been produced under observed conditions, nor judged as agreeable or disagreeable at the time of the experience. The experiment to be reported does fulfil these conditions. Ten different odors (majoritatively essential oils) were selected, which seemed (to 3 observers) to offer a wide range of affective quality, and which seemed to be as equal as possible in intensity. As interest in identifying the odor would be a distraction from the experiment, it was decided, therefore, to allay curiosity by using the true names, and to pronounce them at the moment when the odor was being perceived. It was found that: of 1,020 pleasant impressions experienced 49%, were recalled. Of 882 unpleasant impressions 50%, were recalled, and of 98 'indifferent' ones 56%, were recalled. II. The presence of odor exerted a positive influence in promoting recall of odor names. III. No correlation was found between the memory value of odors and their affective value.

I have tried to engage the reader in the exploration of solutions and the generation of hypotheses and speculations in the evolving major approaches to the field. It was my hope to entice the reader to travel with me in a process of discovery and enlightenment. This book has been written for anyone with an interest in the field, especially those who have been puzzled by the diverse, if not conflicting, orientations of thought concerning the mind. Certainly it will also be of interest to the professionals working in clinical and mental-health-related areas. My aim is to provide a substantial understanding of each of the several diverse stories that shed light on both the nature and expression of the mind. No less important is the desire to make this story of the mind useful to those who read it. The book also leaves a record for posterity that provides an overarching framework for understanding all major approaches to the mind and its frailties. As noted, there is an almost infinite diversity of themes and approaches related to the mind. A historical review should help us recognize how current themes follow a limited number of fundamental assumptions and scientific concepts. As well, curiosity and discovery about where such themes originated and where they appear to be going can provide the delight and excitement of newly acquired knowledge.

Attention increases in the case of celebrated artists when the revenue is likely to be significant, and when the allegation is one of a perceived similarity between the infringing and infringed works. Despite the broad interest and frequently high commercial significance of this issue, there has been little systematic research into what constitutes musical plagiarism from either a technical or perceptual perspective. This article discusses some suggestions made to date for introducing a technical measurement of musical similarity in copyright disputes before presenting our own computational system.

Given the intense interest, curiosity, and wonder that some students had begun to develop after seeing the film The Prestige, a science teacher used this film, which showed Tesla's demonstrations on the wireless transmission of electrical power, as a source of curiosity and wonder. The class that participated in this action research project was an 11th grade class in a rural area of southern Greece. Through an analysis of students' journals, observation, informal discussions, and paper-and-pencil tests, it was found that students (a) became involved with Tesla's life and work, thus developing an interest in current electricity; (b) learned about the skin effect, the biological effects of AC and DC currents; and (c) better understood Ohm's law in their attempt to find out the degree of damage or injury a certain measure of current can cause. Moreover, some students began to develop scepticism and open-mindedness, in addition to their sense of wonder.

1585,Civic Fusion: Moving from Certainty through Not Knowing to Curiosity,"Civic fusion occurs when people bond across passionate difference to solve a shared public problem. It requires bringing people close together under conditions that enable them to bond, even as their polarizing beliefs remain intact. In managing multiparty multi-issue negotiations, public policy mediators help disparate, passionate parties negotiate actionable agreements. To achieve and sustain civic fusion, interested parties recognize and acknowledge confining assumptions and move through a continuum in which their certainty about each other and their presumed solutions is challenged and transforms to uncertainty and then to curiosity. They connect across common public goals and find mutual understanding and respect for the interests of others as they come to understand and accept the opportunities and limitations that are inherent to their complex situations. A steady stream of new understandings moves people beyond their long-held perspectives to foster productive negotiations and build innovative solutions. Ultimately, the parties generate sustainable consensus agreements even as they retain their deeply held and often opposing values and beliefs. <c2><a9> 2014 President and Fellows of Harvard College.","Podziba, S L",0,10.1111/nejo.12059,1137
1587,Living dead: Fearful attractions of film,"FEAR AND FILM have always been intimate companions. One of cinema's primal scenes testifies to this intimacy and originates from the medium's very beginnings: the famous screening in 1895 of Louis and Auguste Lumi<c3><a8>re's L'Arriv<c3><a9>e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat (Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat, also known as Arrival of a Train at the Station) at the Grand Caf<c3><a9> in Paris. The spectators in the Grand Caf<c3><a9>, among cinema's very first public audiences, responded to the image of a train pulling into a station with pure terror. The power of this new technology to grant movement to photography was so overwhelming that viewers turned and fled from the train as if it threatened to crush them. For this audience, the cinematic image of the train became the train itself-something to fear. At least that's how the story goes. The film historian Tom Gunning points out how the oft-repeated accounts of this incident appear more mythological than truthful after careful study of evidence from the period. Writing in 1989, Gunning observes how ""this primal scene at the cinema"" lives on nevertheless, how ""the terrorized spectator of the Grand Caf<c3><a9> still stalks the imagination of film theorists who envision audiences submitting passively to an all-dominating apparatus, hypnotized and transfixed by its illusionist power."" 1 Today, this situation in film studies has changed considerably, due in no small part to Gunning's own pathbreaking scholarship.2 His description of early cinema (1895-1906) as dominated by an aesthetic he calls ""the cinema of attractions"" has become perhaps the single most influential concept in film studies over the last twenty years. Gunning's definition of the cinema of attractions is worth quoting at some length, as I will use it to anchor my own discussion of fear and film to key debates within the discipline of cinema and media studies: The cinema of attractions directly solicits spectator attention, inciting visual curiosity, and supplying pleasure through an exciting spectacle- A unique event, whether fictional or documentary, that is of interest in itself. The attraction to be displayed may also be of a cinematic nature, such as . . . trick films in which a cinematic manipulation (slow motion, reverse motion, substitution, multiple exposure) provides the film's novelty. Fictional situations tend to be restricted to gags, vaudeville numbers or recreations of shocking or curious incidents (executions, current events). It is the direct address of the audience, in which an attraction is offered to the spectator by a cinema showman, that defines this approach to filmmaking. Theatrical display dominates over narrative absorption, emphasizing the direct stimulation of shock or surprise at the expense of unfolding a story or creating a diegetic universe. The cinema of attractions expends little energy creating characters with psychological motivations or individual personality. Making use of both fictional and non-fictional attractions, its energy moves outward towards an acknowledged spectator rather than inward towards the character-based situations essential to classical narrative. This initial formulation of the cinema of attractions, revised and expanded by Gunning in a series of linked essays he began publishing in 1986, already suggests a number of reasons why the concept has continued to resonate so powerfully with film scholars within and beyond the subfield of early cinema. A cinema of attractions uncovers an alternative set of film aesthetics and film histories that had been relegated previously to the margins of what was usually assumed to be central: film's evolution as a narrative-based, storytelling medium. Prior to the recognition of a cinema of attractions, film historians routinely proceeded as if it were cinema's destiny to develop the sort of narratives we now associate with the classical Hollywood style-the dominant form of commercial film style in the United States from roughly 1917 to the present, with remarkable worldwide influence.5 Classical Hollywood style emphasizes psychologically motivated, goal-oriented characters as the active agents who move through cause-effect chains of events. These events are based on a series of temporal deadlines that resolve with a strong degree of closure by the time the film concludes.6 The result is a film style where ""telling a story is the basic formal concern"" and conventions of ""realism"" arise from commitments to concealment of artifice, ""comprehensible and unambiguous"" storytelling, and a ""fundamental emotional appeal that transcends class and nation."" If classical Hollywood style is posited as the norm, then filmmaking practices that deviate from it risk becoming seen as ""primitive"" (such as early cinema) or ""excessive"" (such as genres where spectacle often seems to trump narrative, including musicals and horror films). The cinema of attractions has come to stand for an alternative tradition, one that embraces a set of practices and conventions different from those of classical Hollywood style. Through the lens of a cinema of attractions, what once seemed ""primitive"" or ""excessive"" now emerges as a tradition in its own right, worthy of engagement on its own terms.8 Gunning himself has always maintained that a cinema of attractions must be understood as existing alongside and in dialogue with those narrative priorities at the heart of classical Hollywood style, rather than as a mode incommensurable with it or fundamentally opposed to it. According to Gunning, the fate of the cinema of attractions after its dominance during the early cinema period is not disappearance but relocation; it ""goes underground, both into certain avant-garde practices and as a component of narrative films, more evident in some genres . . . than in others."" 9 If the entire notion of a cinema of attractions springs from the primal encounter-as mythically persistent as it is historically inconsistent-between fearsome film and fearful audiences, then what does the horror film genre in particular have to tell us about the attractions of cinema? Is it possible that this genre, with its multiple and varied investments in shocking, terrifying, disturbing, and haunting its viewers, has more to teach us than perhaps any other about the fearful attractions of film? This chapter attempts to generate some provisional answers to these difficult questions. Much of my own previous research can be seen as responding to similar questions. I have argued elsewhere that the modern horror film (post-1960), in particular cases tied to specific national contexts, confronts viewers with the traumatic legacies of events such as the Holocaust, Hiroshima, and the Vietnam War. I have contended that the allegorical method these horror films employ to engage historical trauma results in a more confrontational address of the spectator than is found in those contemporaneous art films that are often more explicit in their references to traumatic historical events (and always more critically praised). My ultimate goal was to trace a series of ""allegorical moments"" in these horror films that enact ""a shocking collision of film, spectator, and history where registers of bodily space and historical time are disrupted, confronted, and intertwined."" The concept of a cinema of attractions helped to inspire my formulation of the allegorical moment in several ways. First, my sense of the horror film's direct, visceral address of the spectator's body was influenced by the aesthetic of attractions described by Gunning. Second, my claim that the ""excess"" of the horror film could be construed as a strength rather than a weakness when compared with more ""legitimate"" art films mirrored the dynamics of Gunning's encounter between early cinema and classical Hollywood style. Finally, I wished to extend the logic of a cinema of attractions to areas that seemed absent or marginalized in Gunning's model. For example, Gunning's emphasis on the differences between early cinema's attractions and classical Hollywood style's narrative- driven pleasures often constructs a divide between the bodily, sensational aspects of cinematic spectatorship and its more rational, cognitive dimensions focused on storytelling. Although Gunning devotes considerable care and attention to reminding us that such distinctions must not be perceived as absolute or noninteractive, his interest in elucidating one set of terms rather than the other necessarily highlights attractions more so than narrative. What, then, do we make of the horror film's allegorical representation of historical trauma? Is it rooted in attractions, in the direct address of the spectator at the level of bodily sensation? Or is it the product of cognitive processes such as memory and identification upon which narrative depends? My notion of the allegorical moment in the horror film points toward a both/and response to these questions, rather than an either/or. <c2><a9> 2012, University of Pittsburgh Press.

1589,Are you positive?,"Reviews the book, Positivity: Groundbreaking research reveals how to embrace the hidden strength of positive emotions, overcome negativity, and thrive by Barbara Fredrickson (see record 2009-03516-000). Perhaps the central issue of this book is this: How do you get from negativity to positivity-and why should you? Fredrickson does not initially define positivity, but she tell us what it does and how it works: ""It reigns whenever positive emotions-like love, joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, and inspiration-touch and open your heart"" (p. 16). And ""positivity fundamentally changes the way we humans see the world, how we think, and what we do"" (p. 17). Positivity, she tells us, is more than the absence of negativity and health risks; it ""doesn't simply reflect success and health, it can also produce success and health"" (p. 18). Negativity, positivity's antonym, hardly appears until later in the book. We learn that while positivity promotes curiosity and openness to new experiences, negativity inhibits curiosity and openness and constrains one's knowledge and experience of the world. Positivity encourages exploration and involvement; negativity encourages caution and holding back. Individuals dominated by negativity have fewer and less diverse experiences with the world and thus fail to experience and learn as much as those who are more positive. With this being said, Fredrickson has divided her book into two sections: Part I, which focuses on how her research developed, and Part II, which provides self-evaluation instruments and methods of increasing one's positivity. In my opinion, Fredrickson has achieved an admirable balance between a careful explanation of her research and theories and a warm-hearted invitation to readers to deal with their own positivity ratio.

1590,APPLICATION OF INQUIRY-BASED METHODOLOGIES IN SCIENCE TEACHING AND,"Science education can be greatly improved if active methodologies such as the inquiry-based approach are used. Instead of adopting a passive attitude typical of the classic lecture methodology, students are expected to develop their thinking abilities, collect and analyze data, propose and test hypothesis, discuss their results and adopt an overall active attitude in class. Successful science education includes developing a basic working knowledge of the most important concepts and processes of science. But it also involves improving creative thinking, critical thinking and stimulating curiosity and interest to ask questions and look for their answers in a systematic way. The motivated teacher who wants to incorporate these active methodologies in the classroom often finds a wide gap between the methodologies themselves, that can be found and are well described in various articles and books, and their application in the daily planning of the class activities. In this paper, an effort has been made to offer advice coming from different authors, as to how to implement inquiry-based methodologies in the science classroom.","Oliver, Javier",0,,1140

1595,USER EXPERIENCE EVALUATION OF IMMERSIVE VIRTUAL CONTEXTS: THE CASE OF,"Virtual technologies have proved be a valuable support for the knowledge and fruition of the Cultural Heritage. The way they are employed shapes the affection and emotional involvement of the public to which the experience is addressed. On one side, Cultural Heritage represents the historical legacy of a group of people; on the other side, it is also something constantly changing, a process of social appropriation of cultural identity. Features like interactivity, storytelling and sensory immersion are typical of virtual environments; they lend themselves well to the field of Cultural Heritage because (a) they create the right conditions for a fruitful learning experience which ``alert'' many receptive channels; the latter stimulate strong emotions that allow creating mental connections between what we see, what we feel and what we have in our memory. They also (b) provide physical or simulated mobility that stands at the basis of any informal learning experience ( so said ``learn-by-doing''); in this sense, natural interaction applications and tangible interfaces are designed to let the user feel more embodied in the virtual space. They (c) make curiosity and interest arise in a spontaneous form, gradually shaping the memory and the understanding of what we are experiencing. From these premises, the Virtual Museum of the Tiber Valley project has been used as case study to conduct a user experience evaluation. The Italian National Research Council, with the support of national and international contributors, has progressively developed a methodological approach for evaluating user experience into museum contexts trying to come up with a matrix of elements to be further applied to other evaluative scenarios. The focus of such studies shifted recently from the pure usability of immersive virtual systems to the attention on the pedagogical aspects and cognitive affordances. The latter allowed to test some theoretical procedures about direct and informal learning. This is what this contribute is about. What is relevant here is the centrality of the end-user who needs to be the main protagonist of any cultural public transmission and thus of any investigation programme [7].","Pagano, Alfonsina and Pietroni, Eva and Cerato, Ivana",0,,1144
1596,ACTIVATION OF THE VOCATIONAL AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT (ADVP): AN,"Progress in orientation educational practices in Italy has led to the emergence of several methods designed to help the development of personal and career aims. The several evaluations, which have been carried out, show that changes are first cognitive and specifically involve professional representations: experimental subjects used more descriptors and different descriptors to represent an occupation which interests them. These changes are also cognitive with participants stating that they have been involved in experiences and in activities, have sought information, etc. These initial results once again raise the question of instruments needing to be developed for such evaluation, that of the pertinent variables to be included and finally, more generally, that of a more clear-cut definition of desired aims. This project, carried out in a school on the Sicilian territory, during the school year 2013/2014, makes use of one theory: Activation of the vocational and Personal Development (ADVP). Activation of the Vocational and Personal Development (ADVP) is based on Guilford's model of intellect and aims to develop individual intellectual abilities and cognitive attitudes through vocational `` developmental tasks''. These developmental tasks consist of four steps: exploration, crystallization, specification, and implementation. Exploration: this procedure involves an active search for novelty and change, observation and curiosity, the elaboration of hypothesis and risk-taking. This step uses the ``creative thinking'' to explore information. At this step, adolescents should be able to grasp all the possible aspects of a situation or all the elements of a problem. Crystallization: after the exploration process, adolescents accumulate several experiences and different information. They must clarify and organize their perceptions in relation to professional roles. Adolescents then have to reduce their field of preferences in order to reach a general preference which embraces a certain number of activities. In this step the student uses the ``categoricalconceptual thinking'' to organize information. Specification: adolescents specify their preferences in this step. This step could be viewed as a point where personal values intersect with the possibilities provided by environment. The ability used in this step is the ``evaluation thinking'' to differentiate between what is desirable and what is probable. Implementation: At the last step of developmental tasks, adolescents must commit themselves by enrolling in a program of studies or by finding a job in their chosen occupational field by using the result of the previous steps. Thus, this step requires the abilities of planning and elaboration which could be called ``implicative thinking''.","Longo, Leonarda",0,,1145
1597,Review of The cognitive neuroscience of music,"Reviews the book ""The cognitive neuroscience of music"" edited by I. Peretz and R. Zatorre (see record 2003-88181-000). For those interested in laterality, this book is a fantastic read. The chapters cover issues important to music-related research including, but not limited to, topics related to laterality. It is perhaps not too surprising that over the course of the book, the cited research becomes a little repetitive, but in general the book gives a very comprehensive coverage of a wide area. All the authors are well regarded in their respective fields; and they cover research from basic physiology of hearing and animal research, to research on humans. Essentially I have been selective in the chapters for review and the questions of interest. While we can be certain that the auditory cortex, especially the superior temporal gyrus, is important for processing music, patterns of lateralisation do depend on training, expertise, stimuli, and paradigm. This book contains a wealth of up-to-date research on music processing, it provides the reader with the most current views, and the presentation of all this literature fosters intellectual curiosity and focuses researchers on what still needs to be done. Musical experiences alter the brain--it may be that this is an innate ability that changes with time, or it may be that an enriching environment provides the impetus for brain changes and laterality differences.

1601,Can studies of cognitive abilities and of life in the wild really help us to understand equine learning?,"Comments on an article by Murphy and Arkins (see record 2007-12321-001). The subject of equine learning has seen several reviews and well documented syntheses, in the form of papers (Nicol, 2002; Hanggi, 2005) and book chapters (Waring, 2002; McGreevy, 2004; Nicol, 2005). One therefore expects a new review to provide fresh insights and/or original approaches, and it is with curiosity and interest that one opens the review of Murphy and Arkins, especially as the abstract raises interesting issues, such as: A major methodological problem--that positive reinforcements are used quasi-systematically in experimental work, whereas equestrian practice (which such experiments could improve) is primarily based on the use of negative reinforcements; and the interest of ethological studies of feral horses for understanding the domestic horse. Though the review does not break new ground conceptually, it does point the way to some interesting areas where further work is urgently needed on horses. In the section on ""Contemporary training schemes and equine learning"", the authors quite rightly note that training is generally achieved through the use of negative reinforcements. The basic training of saddle horses can indeed be achieved by work in hand, which allows the use of positive reinforcements, nonetheless it is difficult to envisage how a rider in the saddle could do other than use principally negative reinforcements. The authors are quite right about the methodological problems posed by the fact that negative reinforcements are not used more often in experimental studies of training. The authors are also quite right that the question of sidedness and its influence on experimental results, which is seldom dealt with explicitly, needs much more attention (see also Larose et al., 2006). However, some of the points need deeper treatment than they receive.

1603,DATA ANALYSIS AND LEARNING ANALYTICS FOR MEASURE EFFECTS OF GAMIFICATION,"Nowadays the use of the information and communication technologies (ICT) is more and more common in the learning and teaching process. Modern forms of education have risen and these require the implementation of new learning paradigms: situated cognition, student-centred learning, distributed cognition, constructivism, and communities of practice, among others. However there is an important problem that concerns educators, the lack of student motivation and engagement in education, especially in the e-learning environment (Online Education, Online Courses), where the motivation and the active role of students are definitely the key. Therefore, the interest of researchers in the subject of gamification, which main pillars are motivation, progressiveness and instant feedback, has increased. Furthermore, influence of gamification, depending on utilized components (challenge, curiosity, competion, recognition, etc) may have different effects on students. Thus, there is a need of deeper understanding of dependencies between engagement and implemented gamification elements. The goal of such analysis could be personalization of an e-learning system based on a model that enables management of gamification process individually for every student. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how gamification affects a Mathematics Online Course that is using this model as a pedagogical strategy. It relates such strategy with active learning practices and discusses its effectiveness, investigating how gamification can motivate students to participate more deeply and even to change their self-concept as learners. Moreover, the learning analytics and data analysis shows that implementation of the gamification components contributes to the engagement of students in an e-learning environment, having a positive impact on the final grade.","Lopes, Ana Paula and Babo, Lurdes and Azevedo, Jose and Torres, Cristina",0,,1149
1604,On 'being researched': Why do people engage with qualitative research?,"While there has been some anecdotal discussion that hints at what motivates people to engage with qualitative research, little research has systematically explored the role of research engagement for those who choose to participate: Why do people engage with qualitative research? Using interview data collected from experienced researchers (n=13), this article seeks to systematically explore this issue by examining how researchers understand the mechanisms that motivate and facilitate research engagement. At an individual level, the supporting mechanisms identified include: subjective interest, enjoyment, curiosity, introspective interest, social comparison, therapeutic interest, material interest and economic interest. At a collective level, however, the mechanisms identified by researchers include: representation, political empowerment, and informing 'change'. It is argued that a greater appreciation of these supporting mechanisms is likely to be crucial in examining how the research process is shaped by the motivations of those who engage, as well as helping to maintain current levels of research engagement through the development of more positive research relationships. <c2><a9> 2010 The Author(s).","Clark, T",0,10.1177/1468794110366796,1150

1606,"Motivation, Intelligence, and Access: A Theoretical Framework for the Education of Minority Language Students","Interest or motivation, intelligence and experience, and psychosocial access are inextricably bound together in successful educational programs, and none can explain or predict performance by itself. In the realm of interest and motivation, it has been found that youth want to learn how to be effective, like to do the things their parents value, and have almost universal interest in science and mathematics because of natural curiosity about the world. Intelligence is defined as what children do with what they know, the interaction of repertoire and capacity. Understanding of the difference between repertoire and capacity clarifies the distinction between intellectual ability and academic performance. The purpose of educational program design should be to facilitate development of repertoire using the child's natural interest in how the world works. Access can take a variety of forms, including exposure to educational and quasi-educational experiences and ability to communicate in the classroom, and expectations about access can strongly influence academic success. Teachers can begin to address the diversity in a classroom and move all students in the same direction with cooperative or group work, and the primary responsibility of the teacher and aide is to focus the student's perception on the task's essential features. In addition, students must learn to take responsibility for learning. (MSE)","De Avila, Edward",0,,1152
1607,"Natural environments, nature relatedness and the ecological theater: Connecting satellites and sequencing to shinrin-yoku","Recent advances in research concerning the public health value of natural environments have been remarkable. The growing interest in this topic (often housed under terms such as green and/or blue space) has been occurring in parallel with the microbiome revolution and an increased use of remote sensing technology in public health. In the context of biodiversity loss, rapid urbanization, and alarming rates of global non-communicable diseases (many associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation), discussions of natural vis-a-vis built environments are not merely fodder for intellectual curiosity. Here, we argue for increased interdisciplinary collaboration with the aim of better understanding the mechanisms-including aerobiological and epigenetic-that might help explain some of the noted positive health outcomes. It is our contention that some of these mechanisms are related to ecodiversity (i.e., the sum of biodiversity and geodiversity, including biotic and abiotic constituents). We also encourage researchers to more closely examine individual nature relatedness and how it might influence many outcomes that are at the interface of lifestyle habits and contact with ecodiversity. <c2><a9> 2016 Craig et al.","Craig, J M and Logan, A C and Prescott, S L",0,10.1186/s40101-016-0083-9,1153
1608,Cultural competence within behavioral medicine: Culturally-competent CBT with diverse medical populations,"Throughout this chapter we highlight the importance of providing culturally competent care to patients served in behavioral medicine settings especially given the health disparities faced by diverse groups within the USA. We have also reviewed the definition and theoretical framework for cultural competency and discussed specific tools that can be utilized by clinicians in behavioral medicine settings. Tailored and adapted CBT has shown promise in effectively addressing mental health conditions among diverse groups and we have outlined the ways in which tools to enhance cultural competency can be utilized in delivering CBT in medical populations. However, there are still areas for further research and clinical application of culturally competent CBT in behavioral medicine settings. First, cultural competency is often mistakenly conceptualized as a knowledge base and set of tools/skills that once learned are sufficient to effectively work across diverse populations. However, cultural competency is a process that never ends and at its core requires ongoing curiosity and genuine interest in the ways in which patients' multiple identities intersect with their medical conditions and how this intersection impacts patients patients in reaching their health goals. Second, while the evidence for the efficacy of culturally tailored or adapted CBT is growing, there is still a need for additional research on culturally tailored CBT for diverse patients suffering from many health conditions such as HIV, cancer, obesity, and substance use. Third, for existing evidence-based culturally tailored CBT interventions among medical populations, research is needed that examines the added benefit of each intervention component to better inform what tools for enhancing culturally competent care should be disseminated in behavioral medicine settings. Lastly, while cognitive behavioral therapy is an evidence-based and commonly used psychotherapeutic model in behavioral medicine settings, elements of other psychotherapeutic models may be beneficial in delivering culturally competent care. For instance, interpersonal therapy, mindfulness techniques, motivational interviewing, and dialectical behavioral therapy offer tools for (a) validating patients' illnesses and struggles associated with their diverse identities and (b) enhancing acceptance, distress tolerance, and behavior change.

1609,"""I saw your nanny"": Gossip and shame in the surveillance of child care","For all the recent publicity concerning nannies in the popular press (Kantor 2006b), in fiction (Weldon 2007) and nonfiction best-sellers (Davis and Hyams 2006; Hansen 2005; McLaughlin and Kraus 2007), and in academic scholarship (Ehrenreich and Hochschild 2004; Macdonald 1998; Tronto 2002; Parrenas 2001; Wrigley 1995), one might believe that the bulk of working parents rely on this form of care. Nothing could be further from the truth: the vast majority of preschool children are either in a relative's care (40.2 percent) or in an organized care facility (22.7 percent). Only 3.7 percent of preschoolers are being cared for by a nonrelative in the child's home, and only 15 percent of employed parents who rely on paid care for children under five hire nannies for that care (Johnson 2005). Even so, nanny care excites special interest and curiosity, in part because it highlights the challenging question of whether we can purchase love. It makes us confront head-on the issue of racial and class inequalities, and it provokes childhood fantasies about real and fictional caregivers. Nanny care also provides a focus-the nanny herself-for society's acute anxieties about the care and well-being of vulnerable children while leaving unexamined the broader social processes that produce these vulnerabilities. In Other People's Children, Julia Wrigley (1995) made visible the structural and ideological contradictions of nanny care that result in, among other processes, parental use of surveillance (via nanny cams) as a way to handle their anxieties about what happens when they aren't there to watch interactions between the nanny and their child. When Wrigley wrote in 1995, nanny cams were relatively new. More than a decade later, this surveillance technique has become more widely available and been sufficiently publicized to the point that it is now part of everyday speech and awareness. Meanwhile, information about additional monitoring innovations has shown up in newspaper articles and advertisements: a device that enables video conferencing with a nanny from a parent's workplace (Womack 2006); an online service, Whereismybaby.com, that uses a GPS device to monitor the movement of a baby's stroller (Nanos 2006); and surveillance companies that highlight their ability to track information about a nanny's background when ""checking references isn't enough.""1 In August 2006, a website appeared that sought to involve the public in this essentially private solution of close monitoring. Without changing the nature of the relationship between caregivers and care recipients, or between employers and their employees, and without doing anything to make child care a truly public issue, I Saw Your Nanny (Isawyournanny.blogspot. com, hereafter referred to as ISYN) invites the public to extend the gaze of the nanny cam by reporting on nannies as they go about their everyday business in public places. Jane Doe, the website's founder, explains her goals for this site: ""So often mothers and other nannies have commented that they wished they had an avenue to contact the parent of a child they saw being mistreated by the nanny. We want to be that resource.""2 Nannies and mothers, she suggests, need no longer sit passively on the park bench gossiping among themselves (Blackford, Chapter 5); they can now do something if they see a situation they find troublesome. Indeed, they are not limited to just monitoring the performance of women they assume to be nannies and informing parents of any troublesome practices they observe. They can also shame the nanny herself by bringing her into a public spotlight-and, implicitly, they can shame the mother as well.3 ISYN is not unique in taking surveillance and shaming to this new level. Rather, it is in line with other surveillance sites that seek to monitor and control behavior of others by subjecting them to public shame (Scott 2007; Montgomery and Beck 2007; Proudfoot 2007; Swartz 2007). Browse the Web and you can find sites that publicize the license plates of bad drivers (aboveaveragedriver. com; platewire.com) or of individuals parked illegally in handicap spaces (caughtya.org), sites that post pictures of men who leer or whistle at women (HollaBackNYC.com), and sites that post pictures of people talking loudly on cell phones (RudePeople.com), among others. In a Wall Street Journal article, Henry Jenkins, director of the media studies program at MIT, argues that ""the embrace of the Web to expose trivial transgressions in part represents a return to shame as a check on social behavior"" (Saranow 2007). The public shaming that occurs on Internet sites raises significant questions about just whose values are reflected in the definition of certain behave iors as offensive, and about just how fair or evenhanded the ""judges"" are in identifying individuals as being guilty of specific ""offenses."" Just as individuals who stop a mother on the street and ask about her relationship to a daughter who appears to be of a different race or ethnicity make this gesture on the basis of a biological notion about how ""real"" families are created (Jacobson, Chapter 4), individuals who report on the ""offensive"" behavior of others are equally likely to be working from their own biases and misconceptions, including, perhaps, a misconception about who is a nanny and who is not. Thus we have to ask whether those who seek to shame nannies (and by extension, to shame the mothers who hire them) on ISYN start from very particular and very class-bound norms concerning what constitutes appropriate care, and whether they are selective in their perception of who is at fault for deviating from those norms. These are the questions at stake in this chapter. <c2><a9> 2009 by Vanderbilt University Press. All rights reserved.","Nelson, M K",0,,1155
1611,Emotional and cognitive predictors of the enjoyment of reality-based and fictional television programming: An elaboration of the uses and gratifications perspective,"This article reports the results of two studies designed to compare predictors of enjoyment of reality-based and fictional television programming. In Study 1, 260 adults completed a survey of their cognitive and emotional reactions to either the fictional or reality-based programming that they generally watch. In Study 2, 502 adults completed a similar survey but with a particular reality-based or fictional program in mind. Results suggest first that though voyeurism (i.e., curiosity about others) appears to be a key distinguishing gratification between reality and fictional programming, it is not always a predictor of reality television enjoyment. Indeed, many predictors of enjoyment, like happiness, parasocial relationships, social comparison, self-awareness, negative outcome, and dramatic challenge, varied as much among types of reality programs as between reality and fiction. Of particular interest, three variables-learning, suspense, and transportation-had opposite effects on enjoyment. depending on their programming context. The implications of these findings, as well as the role of perceived realism and our ability to explain more variance in enjoyment of reality versus fictional programming, are addressed. Apart from its insight into the reality television phenomenon, this research helps to more clearly articulate the cognitive and emotional underpinnings of enjoyment and further offers a unique theoretical perspective on the connection between the uses and gratifications paradigm and the construct of enjoyment.","Nabi, Robin L and Stitt, Carnien R and Halford, Jeff and Finnerty, Keli L",0,10.1207/s1532785xmep0804_5,1156

1618,"Whole Language ESL: Reading, Writing, and Speaking","An English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) educator of migrant students in a rural county in Oregon used a whole-language approach to language and reading instruction. Although reading instruction in Spanish was preferred, lack of Spanish-speaking personnel and limited ESL instructional time prohibited that approach. In whole-language ESL, the teacher exposes students to interesting books, language experience activities, and field trips to spark student interest and curiosity. Language acquisition, as opposed to language learning, is an almost unconscious effort growing from the desire to understand something of interest. All types of language experience activities are conducive to language acquisition. Students create personal dictionaries of words they are learning and add pictures cut from magazines. Wordless books offer pictorial stories for discussion and writing of the story. The created stories are meaningful because the students create the story in their own vocabulary. Easy-reader Spanish-language books help students retain their home-language skills. In the classroom it is important to let students know that practice in speaking and reading Spanish will also improve their English. English books for primary ESL students must be easy, somewhat predictable, and ridiculous. This paper contains an extensive list of wordless books. (KS)","Wilson, Kathryn Anne",0,,1160
1619,Factors Affecting the Career Decision Making of Minority Teachers in Gifted Education,"This report discusses factors affecting the decisions of minority groups to become teachers in gifted education. Forty-four minority teachers participated in this study. While 42 percent of the teachers reported that they currently work with gifted students, few shared their reasons. More teachers discussed why they had not become teachers of gifted students. Two themes related to social reasons and two related to personal reasons. Social reasons related to lack of administrative support and lack of gifted education programs. Personal reasons related to lack of interest and their teaching philosophy (i.e., the belief that all children are gifted). Likewise, the minority teachers identified social and personal reasons for becoming teachers of gifted students. Some teachers also shared how their experiences with special education students influenced their vocational choice. For instance, several teachers shared concerns regarding negative experiences in special education, as well as experience in working with gifted students with special needs. Social or external reasons for becoming teachers of gifted students included support and encouragement from colleagues and administration. Personal reasons included an interest in gifted students, primarily from curiosity, and a determination to demonstrate that minority teachers can be competent gifted education teachers.

In Rome they were mostly freedmen. But what inspired their combination into secret orders does not appear plain to those who study the past for the sake of gratifying a taste for great events. Neither do those who study it for purposes of gleaning points in philosophy and religion as commonly understood, obtain any correct idea of them. The ancient contempt rooted in the taint of labor which slavery inspired is yet too strong; and there still lingers too much of the old spirit of paganism to allow of interest, or hardly of curiosity.

1625,Technological innovations and publications related to space science education,"As NASA Administrator Dan Goldin has noted, children are especially interested in three things: ghosts, dinosaurs, and space. We need to capitalize on the interest in space to develop and encourage a continuing understanding and curiosity about space-related issues from the grade school level through adulthood. Unfortunately, because astronomy is usually only offered in college as an introductory-level elective or as a specialized area of graduate study, most pre-college educators are uncomfortable teaching spade sciences in the classroom. Additionally, the particularly dynamic nature of the field leaves educators with materials that are out-of-date and inadequate. In the framework of the new educational pedagogy focusing on hands-on activities, this paper presents a discussion of technologically innovative resources for the space science classroom (primarily at the high school level) which utilize hands-on activities for the students. The discussion will focus in five areas: major high-tech programs (which require specialized equipment in the schools), national and local workshops available to educators, hands-on activities commercially available, educational astronomical resources, and examples of hands-on activities developed and expanded upon by teachers and astronomers attending an educational workshop in Hawai'i from 1993-1995.

1626,ANOTHER LOOK AT THE ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION-GROWTH NEXUS IN CROATIA: HAS,"During the last two decades, a number of papers have addressed the causality between economic growth and electricity consumption. Although a strong interdependence and causality between economic growth and electricity consumption represent a stylized economic fact, the existence and direction of the causality is still not clearly defined. Most studies have been based on a bivariate approach that explores the causal relationship between electricity consumption and output (GDP). This approach has limitations and is not able to capture the multivariate framework within which the changes in electricity use are frequently countered by the substitution of other factors of production, resulting in an insignificant overall impact on output. The lack of consensus on whether economic growth results in electricity consumption or is electricity the stimulant of economic growth has aroused the curiosity and interest among economists and analysts to investigate the direction of causality between these variables. Over time, various empirical studies have focused on different countries or groups of countries (both developed and developing countries as well as the so-called emerging economies), time periods, main (and proxy) variables and quantitative methods. The results of such studies are often contradictory. This can be explained by different econometric methodologies, different data set and different countries' characteristics. The aim of this paper is to analyse the available data on GDP and electricity consumption in Croatia for the last six decades using the so-called bootstrap approach within a multivariate framework that includes capital stock and labour (and dummy variables to reflect structural breaks in the data). The time period used in this analysis is 1952-2015, which covers a long-term period during which substitution among production inputs could occur. Therefore, the main aim of the paper is to empirically determine whether a causal link exists among capital stock (as a proxy for capital), employment (as a proxy for labour), total electricity consumption (without transmission and distribution losses) and economic growth in Croatia. In addition to empirical results, policy implications and recommendations for future research will also be presented in the paper.","Jakovac, Pavle",0,,1165
1627,An analysis of the pedagogical affordances of a virtual learning environment in a Catholic school,"The purpose of this mixed study was to examine the pedagogical affordances of a virtual learning environment at a 4th grade and 7 th grade level in one Catholic school. The study analyzed student academic achievement scores over a two-week testing window in two science classes. The quantitative measurements consisted of pretest and posttest assessments. The study focused on the utilization of zSpace's augmented virtual reality devices to convey scientific information, theory, and concepts. In addition to the pedagogical component of the study, qualitative data were collected to compare student motivation, interest levels, and peer collaboration between a traditional learning environment and an environment supporting the virtual reality devices, zSpace, designed to help students discover and understand abstract and complex concepts through manipulation and dissections of 3-Dimensional images. The study revealed that there were no statistically significant pedagogical differences between the traditional learning environment compared to the experimental learning environment at the 4th grade and 7th grade levels. The quantitative data, however; did reveal trends demonstrating higher academic gains from the pretest to the posttest in the experimental environments. The study's qualitative data revealed that there is value to the use of virtual reality regarding increased student motivation, interest levels, and collaborative learning opportunities. The qualitative data support the inclusion of the augmented virtual reality device, zSpace, as a unique learning tool to support student learning, independence skills, and individualized instruction. In addition to this, the use of zSpace devices sparked curiosity, higher-level thinking, and fostered a deeper meaning of science concepts amongst students. Limitations of the augmented virtual reality devices, although minimal, were noted such as motion sickness, technical issues, and overstimulation of software upon users. This study provides additional information to the field of education where limited research has been conducted at the elementary and middle school level regarding the use of virtual reality as a viable learning tool. Future recommendations have been identified to explore the affordances of such technology within the areas of special education and the building of student-centric educational environments where learning is not limited to traditional methods of instruction and resources.

At the onset of each project, student expectations were shared and at the end of each project time for reflection was given in order for students to learn and make improvements. Integrating English language arts into a project-based curriculum combines some traditional teaching methods with the project-based approach. A lack of prerequisite skills in teaming and hands on, minds on learning may have limited the success of implementing this curriculum. Through integrated English language arts project-based learning students were provided with a meaningful and relevant student-centered curriculum; an environment where students learned through working together on teams; a curriculum that created opportunities for hands on, minds on learning; and opportunities through this curriculum to learn life skills. Results of this study will aid educators in determining whether or not to implement a project-based learning curriculum and suggest how to successfully implement it.","Martinez, Rene",0,,1167
1630,"Students' level of boredom, boredom coping strategies, epistemic curiosity, and graded performance","The authors examined the relationships among students' levels of boredom, boredom coping strategies, epistemic curiosity, and graded performance regarding mathematics lessons, with the intention to explore the mediating roles of boredom coping strategies and epistemic curiosity in the relationship between the level of boredom and graded performance. A total of 557 students from a small city located in the Western Black Sea region of Turkey voluntarily participated in the study. Of them, 211 enrolled in an Anatolian high school and 346 enrolled in a science high school. Results showed that the level of boredom, boredom coping strategies, epistemic curiosity, and graded performance were significantly related to each other. Results also showed that deprivation-type epistemic curiosity and interest-type epistemic curiosity played significant mediating roles in the relationship between the level of boredom and graded performance. Notably, the mediating roles of interest-type epistemic curiosity and deprivation-type epistemic curiosity differed across gender groups.","Eren, Altay and Coskun, Hamit",0,10.1080/00220671.2014.999364,1168
1631,Inventory of pedagogy and practice: confirmatory factor analysis of multiple facets of teaching,"Student perceptions of teaching have often been used in tertiary education for evaluation purposes. However, there is a paucity of research on the validity, reliability, and applicability of instruments that cover a wide range of student perceptions of pedagogies and practices in high school settings for descriptive purposes. The study attempts to validate an inventory of pedagogy and practice (IPP) that provides researchers and practitioners with a psychometrically sound instrument that covers the most salient factors related to teaching. Using a sample of students (N = 1515) from 39 schools in Singapore, 14 factors about teaching in English lessons from the students' perspective were tested with confirmatory factor analysis (classroom task goal, structure and clarity, curiosity and interest, positive class climate, feedback, questioning, quality homework, review of students' work, conventional teaching, exam preparation, behaviour management, maximizing learning time, student-centred pedagogy, and subject domain teaching). Two external criterion factors were used to further test the IPP factor structure. The inventory will enable teachers to understand more about their teaching and researchers to examine how teaching may be related to learning outcomes. <c2><a9> 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Yeung, A S and Taylor, P G and McWilliam, E L",0,10.1080/1743727X.2012.696243,1169
1632,Beyond School Walls: What Parents Can Do to Widen the Horizons of Their Gifted Learners,"Parents of gifted children play a powerful role in expanding their world and helping them discover what they love. When gifted children have impassioned, open-minded, and creative family members, they are free to discover what they love and who they are as people. For gifted learners, curiosity, passion, and interest are absolute essentials. Gifted children have a questing spirit; they live for discovery. Parents may even notice that when children find interesting problems to think about, they look different. There is palpable excitement, eagerness, a burning need to know, and a lively curiosity that can be seen in their eyes. Parents often ask: ""What can I do that will make a difference?"" In this article the author encourages parents to begin by looking at themselves and their homes as a rich resource for their gifted children.","Smutny, Joan Franklin",0,,1170
1633,Review of The self-marginalization of Wilhelm Stekel: Freudian circles inside and out,"Reviews the book, The self-marginalization of Wilhelm Stekel: Freudian circles inside and out by Jaap Bos and Leendert Groenendijk (see record 2006-20640-000). This book is written with the interest and motivation of the historical scientist. By illuminating the disagreements and dissensions between Stekel and Freud, the authors contend that marginalization is symptomatic of large group processes and is a necessary process enabling a system of ideas to evolve. Bos and Groenendijk contend that, in order to look at why a person becomes marginalized, the researcher has to look at the dialogical discourse, that is, the latent content of the unconscious forces that create the dynamics between the players involved in the marginalization process. The book is well researched and opens up areas that raise the reader's curiosity and stimulate ideas for further research. Its greatest asset is in conveying the sense that every movement of ideas, be it in the realm of science, politics or philosophy carries an underlying discourse that is particular to the social dynamics occurring at the time. Whilst the present book would not provide experienced practitioners or students of psychoanalysis with new insights or formulations with which to further their theoretical or clinical knowledge, it does, however, offer interesting historical material which contributes to the understanding of the struggles undergone by the pioneers in psychoanalysis to arrive at their present knowledge. The book excels as a useful source of reference for all those interested in the history of the psychoanalytic movement.

1634,Justifying Journalistic Harms: Right to Know vs. Interest in Knowing,"Journalists are regularly criticized for causing harm to others, such as invading privacy, printing, or airing offensive material, and so forth. Although most sensitive journalists readily acknowledge these harms, they frequently argue that the pursuit and coverage of news is nonetheless justified because it fulfills a greater moral purpose<e2><80><94>satisfaction of the public's right to know. This article argues that although <e2><80><9c>the public's right to know<e2><80><9d> does justify some harmful journalistic behavior, too often the phrase is used without the conceptual precision necessary to justify the competing harm. That is, journalists often confuse having a right to know with having an interest or curiosity in knowing and such conceptual confusion too often allows journalistic behavior to occur that would otherwise be seen as unethical. <c2><a9> 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

1636,The text critical sigla in Codex Vaticanus,"The study of the Vaticanus umlauts is still in its infancy. It is the intention of this work to advance the field of study in a handful of key areas. In accomplishing this study, five conclusions have been reached. First, the umlauts mark places of textual variation between Vaticanus and another manuscript or manuscripts. Of this, all scholars appear to be in agreement. The statistical evidence is clear that fines marked by umlauts are considerably more likely to contain textual variants than unmarked lines. Additional tests performed by multiple scholars also confirm that the umlauts do mark places of textual variation. Additionally, there is another siglum in Codex Vaticanus, the marginal colon, that appears, at first glance, to be similar to the umlauts. With further analysis, however, it is clear that the marginal colons have another function not related to the marking of variants. Second, though it is possible that some of the umlauts were placed in the manuscript later, all of the evidence points to the fact that the umlauts are made very early, close to the time of the manuscript's production, possibly by the original scribe of Vaticanus. There is some 'crowding' that occurs regarding umlaut placement that could suggest the umlauts were placed in the text after the Vaticanus canon numbers were added to the manuscript. If true, this could mean that it was not the original scribe who placed the umlauts, though such a conclusion would not demand a date for the umlauts much later than the fourth century. Additionally there are two difficult instances of nonstandard umlaut placement that appear be the result of crowding by marginalia that is considerably later. These two instances of unusual umlaut placement are most likely coincidental, since a significant number of the umlauts are placed in nonstandard locations. Third, there is no good mechanical evidence to suggest whether the umlauts were placed sequentially or sporadically, but very little hinges on the timing of umlaut placement. Given that all of the evidence, text-critical, paleographical, and logical, points to a very early date for the umlauts, the question of timing is little more than a curiosity. The existence of umlaut imprints, ink from an umlaut (retraced or not) that bled over onto the opposite page when the pages of the codex were closed, could be an indication that the umlauts were made after the text was transcribed and that they were made sporadically. In other words, it is possible that some umlauts were placed throughout the text during a first pass through the manuscript and that some umlauts were then placed during a second pass, etc. It is also possible that the umlauts were placed sequentially in a single pass through the manuscript. Fourth, Vaticanus does not contain the Pericope de Adultera, and there is no umlaut at 7:53 marking the PA's omission. There is, however, an umlaut in the column of empty space following the end of John. The most likely explanation for this is that the scribe of Vaticanus who placed the umlauts had access to a manuscript that most likely did not contain the PA after John 7 and had some additional text appended to the end of John. The most likely candidate for this manuscript is an ancestor of Family 1. Statistical analysis of the frequency of Family 1 variants at umlauted lines confirms this. Fifth, more than one manuscript was most likely employed in the making of the umlauts. Given the nature of the variation marked and the nature of the texts suggested by the umlauts, it seems possible that the scribe of Vaticanus making the umlauts was not marking every place of variation in the manuscripts he possessed, or even always the most notable places of variation, but rather was marking 'places of interest.' This makes identifying the number of sources for the umlauts difficult, but candidates can be suggested. Though there is no discernible connection between the umlauts in Vaticanus and any extant papyri, there is a noticeable connection between the umlauts and the Syriac text. And there is a clearly demonstrable connection between the umlauts in the Gospels of Vaticanus and the manuscripts in the Family 1 tradition. It seems, therefore, highly unlikely that the scribe of Vaticanus had a single manuscript with a mixed text sufficient to produce all of the umlauts. It also appears highly unlikely that the Syriac text and Family 1 are sufficient to explain all of the umlauts. Other texts were likely employed. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

1638,Performance-Based Assessment: An Alternative Assessment Process for Young Gifted Children,"Performance-based assessment provides an alternative identification method for young gifted children. A performance-based identification process was developed and implemented to select three-, four-, and five-year-old children for inclusion in a school for gifted children. Literature regarding child development, characteristics of young gifted children, and multiple intelligences theories was analyzed to determine observable behavior. Educators experienced in gifted education designed activities to elicit such behaviors. Activities were designed to include language experiences, musical and kinesthetic activities, math games, and curiosity projects. Social and emotional behaviors were observed as children participated in the activities. Information from development profiles and parental questionnaires was reviewed. Rating-scale information and anecdotal records from the performance-based assessment were analyzed to provide the rationale for individual student's admission into the gifted program. A study evaluating the effectiveness of the performance-based assessment program over 3 years indicated it was an effective tool for identifying young gifted children. Includes one table.

1639,Mondrian's search for geometric purity: Creativity and fixation,"This essay derives from the author's larger interest in ""Geometry and the Mind."" That interest has arisen from a confluence between his clinical work as a psychoanalyst and psychotherapist and his longstanding extra-clinical interests in literature and the arts. The essay begins by tracing the course of the author's curiosity and by outlining a working hypothesis about geometry and the mind, emphasizing both conflictual and adaptive aspects of that relationship-geometry as a defense against disorder and geometry as an act of creation. The essay then moves to a detailed examination of the life and work of Piet Mondrian. The author seeks to discuss elements of his cultural, artistic, and political milieu that help locate Mondrian among his artistic contemporaries-abstract geometric artists-but also help demarcate his distinctive personal and artistic characteristics in comparison with those contemporaries. With this background presented, it is possible to discern more readily which elements of Mondrian's life and work reflect the idiosyncratic conflictual areas that might have contributed, paradoxically, both to his creativity and to a constriction in his work. The author discusses the limitations of what one can say psychoanalytically about the person Mondrian, and presents reasons for these limitations. The essay concludes with a summary reflection on the process of constructing and writing on this topic.

1640,Adolescent involvement with the supernatural and cults: Some psychoanalytic considerations,"Discusses the range of supernatural preoccupations in adolescence divided along of a continuum of religious supernatural to the antireligious supernatural. Adolescent responses to the potentially overstimulating media and peer preoccupation varies from curiosity to devout interest. Three cases are presented to illustrate how adolescents weave supernatural involvements into their major psychopathology. The cases typify the preoedipal, borderline, and narcissistic trends that the supernatural metaphor fit into phenomenologically. It is concluded that adolescent preoccupation with cults and the supernatural is reflective of old and familiar adolescent psychodynamic and psychogenetic issues. Sudden shifts in varieties of youth culture do not affect intrapsychic structure. Sociocultural phenomena, however, can lead to changes in childrearing and ultimately affect intrapsychic pathology.

1641,Emotions in mentalization-based treatment (MBT),"Mentalization-based treatment (MBT) is an evidence-based treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD). The article describes the significance of faulty mirroring of primary emotions for the failure of developing a coherent self for patients with BPD. Self-integration of emotions is a primary aim of MBT. MBT contains several strategies for maintaining a focus on emotional dysfunctions in close relationships: 1) Assessment interviews on episodes of mentalization failures, 2) building these narratives into a joint mentalization-based case formulation, 3) psychoeducational group therapy on the themes of mentalization, emotions and attachment, 4) mentalization- based group therapy which focusses on emotions in interpersonal encounters, and 5) individual psychotherapy which may explore in depth the intersubjective emotional transactions in the here and now. In concert, these strategies are powerful means to maintain the focus on emotions, to stimulate curiosity and interest in emotional experiences, and, by a not knowing stance, to enhance the patient's abilities to reflect upon and integrate emotional experiences.

We unpack similarities and differences between the two species in terms of their interests and intentions in an urban environment through detailed examination of the moments in the walk when the leash is pulled taut. We show how a strained leash can result from a conflict between the dog's attentiveness towards other dogs by smelling and looking, and the human's urge to move along. We propose design directions supporting the dogs' wants and needs by accessing the handler with information on the dogs' curiosities in other dogs by visualizing the invisible scentuniverse of the dogs and encourage dog-dog interaction.","Aspling, Fredrik and Juhlin, Oskar and Chiodo, Elisa",0,10.1145/2832932.2837013,1180

1647,The expression and enactment of interest and curiosity in a multiple source use task,"Selecting and incorporating multiple text and non-text sources is an academic task that has been identified as both commonplace and challenging for undergraduate students. Although the term digital natives is frequently used to describe students of this generation, the degree to which undergraduate students prefer or effectively use digital as compared to print sources has been relatively unaddressed. Additionally, although individual differences such as knowledge have been identified as important for multiple source use and comprehension, the role of motivational variables has been under-examined and has focused on source use within a single medium (i.e., digital or print). This study investigated the role of two motivational variables, interest and curiosity. It examined the degree to which the confluence of these motivational variables in conjunction with knowledge predicted source selection, source use, and task performance when students were provided with multiple print and digital sources. Undergraduate students wore a head-mounted videocamera as they developed a PowerPoint presentation on Alzheimer's disease based on 16 available resources (8 print and 8 digital). Follow-up interviews were conducted to determine the degree to which interest and curiosity influenced students' selection and use of sources. Measures of topic knowledge, topic interest, and epistemic trait curiosity were assessed a priori. A coding scheme for capturing use of print and digital sources was developed for the purpose of this study. Differences across source medium and source type (e.g., textbook, image) were evident. Although students exhibited preferences for selecting several types of sources in a digital format, they spent twice as long using print sources, incorporated more print sources into their presentations, and developed more inferences based on print sources. Students with more knowledge, interest, and curiosity spent more time using print sources but less time using digital sources. Further, students' presentations revealed a tendency to replicate material from sources rather than to draw inferences, make conclusions, or integrate material across sources. Findings suggest the tendency for undergraduate students to focus their processes on the management of information rather source integration particularly when using digital compared to print sources.

Particular interest was in determining further the factor structure of the General Attitude and Belief Scale as confirming REBT theory concerning the nature of irrational thinking. A sample of 236 males and 490 females drawn from a variety of populations completed the General Attitude and Belief Scale as well as a number of cross-validational measures (Spielberger's Trait Anxiety, Curiosity and Anger Scales, Spielberger's Anger Expression Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory (short-form) and Diener's Life Satisfaction Scale). A second sample of 18 couples receiving on-going marriage counselling and 43 couples not receiving counselling also completed the General Attitude and Belief Scale. A principal factors analysis yielded one factor of rationality and six irrationality factors (need for achievement, need for approval, demands for fairness, need for comfort, self-downing and other-downing). Significant correlations were obtained between the seven subscales of the General Attitude and Belief Scale and cross-validational measures. The clinical group of distressed couples scored lower in rationality and higher on three of the six sub-scales of irrationality. The findings support the continued use of the General Attitude and Belief Scale as a research instrument and of value to practitioners. <c2><a9> 1998 Human Sciences Press, Inc.","Bernard, M E",0,10.1023/A:1024911014579,1183

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2008-10277-006.) Traditionally, accelerated development in companies aims to equip organizational members with the skills, knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral patterns necessary for success in roles and tasks that are perceived to be more challenging and important than those currently held by the incumbents. Stepping up to the next level usually depends on doing extremely well in the current role, exceeding the targets set, and demonstrating a ""can-do"" attitude and constant readiness for the next challenge. Selecting those who are nominated for some kind of an accelerated track is often based on their professional or managerial potential and the way in which this fits the role ahead of them. The personal interest and involvement of top executives in the process of developing leadership talent is critical for its success. Such interest usually requires strong support from HR and learning and development professionals capable of capitalizing on executive curiosity and will.

Semi-structured expert interviews help to explore reasons for issue emergence and to identify formal and informal agenda setting mechanisms. The observation at international conferences provides further insights. A variety of factors influenced the issue emergence and agenda setting process. The severity of the consequences of distorted sex ratios at birth regarding human rights violations, criminality and gender inequality increased interest in the topic and led to the uptake by actors on the national and international level.

1659,Principles of Functioning of Autonomous Agent-Physicist,"An interesting approach towards human-level intelligence has been proposed at BICA 2011 [1]. Namely, it is proposed that an intelligent artificial BICA agent would be able to win a political election against human candidates. The current work proposes another approach. Our approach is based on the fact that the most serious cognitive processes are processes of scientific cognition. The background of this approach is the report by Modest Vaintsvaig at the Russian conference ``Neuroinformatics-2011'' [2]; that report considers the models of an autonomous agent that tries to cognize elementary laws of mechanics. The agent observes movements and collisions of rigid bodies, forms its own knowledge about interactions of bodies. Basing on these observations, the agent can generalize its knowledge and cognize regularities of mechanical interactions. So, modeling of such autonomous agents, we can try to analyze, how agents could discover (by themselves, without any human help) elementary laws of mechanics. Ultimately, such agents could discover three Newton's laws of mechanics. Thus, we can investigate autonomous agents that could come to the discovery of the laws of nature. It is natural to think that these agents have human-level intelligence. Using our knowledge about scientific activity of Isaac Newton, we can represent intelligence of such investigating agent in some details. The agent should have an aspiration for the acquisition of the new knowledge and for the transforming of its knowledge into compact form. The agent should have the curiosity that directs the agent to ask the questions about the external world and to resolve these questions by executing real physical experiments. The agent should take into account the interrelations between different kinds of the scientific knowledge. It is natural to assume that a certain society of cognizing agents exists; the agent of the society informs other agents about its scientific results. For example, considering Isaac Newton as a prototype of the main agent, we can consider also agents that are analogous to Galileo Galilei, Rene Descartes, Johannes Kepler, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Robert Hooke. The agent should have the self-consciousness, the emotional estimation of the results of its cognition activity and the desire to reach the highest results within the society. Agents should have the tendency to get the clear, strong and compact knowledge, such as Newton's laws or Euclidean axioms.","Red'ko, Vladimir G",0,,1192
1663,Between certainty and uncertainty - observations on psychoanalysis in Russia,"`Diversity', the theme of our conference, carries a subversive sub-text in totalitarian societies. This is one of the themes presented as the current revival of psychoanalysis in the more democratic post-Communist Russia is explored. The history of psychoanalysis in Russia is summarized with a focus on its politicization, which le to initial interest in its theory (by way of a misapprehension of its tenets), and then to ultimate suppression of psychoanalytic thinking as an ideology deemed antagonistic to the totalitarian regime. In contrast, features of psychoanalysis and democracy are explored for their mutual affinities. The background of the resourceful new generation of analytic therapists is discussed, especially in regard to their experience of the parallel meanings of the word `repression' (political, psychological). There is a persistence of some traits in patients and practitioners alike that are referable to past repression, such as the newness of verbal treatments, the inhibition of psychological curiosity, the ambivalent lure of certainty, and the pressure of authoritarian introjects. It is noted that psychoanalysis has its own history of a posture opposed to pluralism and diversity, which deepens the dialogue on the mutual engagement between psychoanalysis and the vicissitudes of its history in Russian culture.","Goldsmith, G N",0,10.1111/1465-5922.00306,1193
1664,"Educating the Masses: An Examination of a Massive Open Online Course Development Lifecycle at an Online, For-Profit University","A growing phenomenon in higher education is the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). MOOCs have garnered increasing attention over the past several years, spurring curiosity, controversy, and debate. While some aspects of MOOCs, such as participant experience and improvement of the online learning environment, have been covered extensively, other areas such as administrative decision-making, design and pedagogy, and alternative uses are less frequently discussed. This single case study sought to address gaps in the existing body of research, particularly the administrative decisions involved in offering a MOOC, the instructional design process, and the instructor experience. The project covers a 32-month period and explores one university's decision to offer a MOOC, its choices related to course content, design decisions in selecting and developing activities, and the instructor's activity and role in facilitating the MOOC. Important data derive from project documentation and records, interviews, direct observation, and course artifacts. The findings create a unique view into why and how the university created and offered a MOOC. The original motivation for creating a MOOC centered on attracting new enrollments into the university's degree plans, but new interests and initiatives emerged as the university became more ingrained in the open learning movement. The opportunity to learn more about design, pedagogy, and instructional technology became apparent. By designing and developing the MOOC, the university learned more about its existing design approaches and incorporated these lessons into its processes. Little was gleaned from the facilitation perspective because of low participation, but the experience informed decision-making about scheduling faculty and managing the instructional process. This study makes important contributions to MOOC literature in the areas of administrative decision-making, instructional design, and pedagogy. It also offers insight into the growing interest in open learning within for-profit higher education and alternative uses for MOOCs and other forms of open, online learning. The future success of open learning initiatives at the university remains to be seen, but the situation provides fertile ground for further study and offers a research perspective for other institutions that are questioning the value of offering open online courses, massive or otherwise.

This case study provides an overview of historical considerations necessary to understand the place of astronomy in Japanese society as well as methodological considerations that highlight traditional approaches that have at times been a barrier to interdisciplinary research. Some specific areas of study in the cultural astronomy of Japan are discussed including examples of contemporary research based on interdisciplinary approaches.

1666,Three key affordances for serendipity Toward a framework connecting environmental and personal factors in serendipitous encounters,"Purpose - Serendipity is an interesting phenomenon to study in information science as it plays a fundamental - but perhaps underestimated - role in how we discover, explore, and learn in all fields of life. The purpose of this paper is to operationalize the concept of serendipity by providing terminological ``building blocks'' for understanding connections between environmental and personal factors in serendipitous encounters. Understanding these connections is essential when designing affordances in physical and digital environments that can facilitate serendipity. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, serendipity is defined as what happens when we, in unplanned ways, encounter resources (information, things, people, etc.) that we find interesting. In the outlined framework, serendipity is understood as an affordance, i.e., a usage potential when environmental and personal factors correspond with each other. The framework introduces three key affordances for facilitating serendipity: diversifiability, traversability, and sensoriability, covering capacities of physical and digital environments to be diversified, traversed, and sensed. The framework is structured around couplings between the three key affordances and three key personal serendipity factors: curiosity, mobility, and sensitivity. Ten sub-affordances for serendipity and ten coupled personal sub-factors are also briefly outlined. Related research is compared with and mapped into the framework aiming at a theoretical validation. The affordance approach to serendipity is discussed, including different degrees and types of serendipity. Findings - All the terminological ``building blocks'' in the framework are seen to resonate with the included related research. Serendipity is found to be a commonplace phenomenon in everyday life. It is argued that we cannot ``engineer'' nor ``design'' serendipity per se, but can design affordances for serendipity. Serendipity may thus be intended by designers, but must always be unplanned by users. The outlined affordance approach to serendipity points to the importance of our sensory-motor abilities to discover and explore serendipitous affordances. Research limitations/implications - Implications of the framework for designing physical and digital environments with affordances for serendipity are briefly considered. It is suggested that physical environments may have a primacy regarding affordances of sensoriability for facilitating serendipity, and digital environments a primacy regarding traversability, whereas physical and digital environments may afford similar degrees of diversifiability. In future research, the framework needs further empirical validation in physical and digital environments. Originality/value - No other research has been found addressing affordances for serendipity and connections between environmental and personal factors in similarly detailed ways. The outlined framework and typology may function as a baseline for further serendipity studies.","Bjorneborn, Lennart",0,10.1108/JD-07-2016-0097,1196
1667,The therapist stance in time-limited MBT-C,"The authors argue that the therapist's stance in mentalization-based therapy (MBT) is at the core of what MBT is and how it works. The stance is crucial because it is both an aim of MBT for children (MBT-C) insofar as therapists are trying to help families develop the capacity to mentalize but also the means through which this aim can be achieved by trying to model this stance. This chapter therefore sets out the key components of this mentalizing stance, including the importance of curiosity, humor, and an interest in exploring the perspective of others. Most important, we describe the ways in which the therapist's own mentalizing capacity can break down and the importance of identifying these moments and using them for therapeutic ends. We end by making some comments about the role of supervision in supporting the therapist's mentalizing stance and describe an approach to supervision that focuses explicitly on helping therapists to maintain their own capacity to mentalize.

1668,An examination of innovative pedagogical practices for turning around or enhancing student persistence rates,"Self-determined motivation can be observed when one engages in a behavior that is conducted out of choice and personal values per Chan, Fung, Xing, and Hagger (2014). Low student self-determination is characterized by behaviors, such as very poor class attendance, a failure to attempt to turn in assigned homework or attend scheduled exams, poor exam performance, a lack of study time, and lackluster, laissez-faire attitudes and deportment (Oleck, 2007). Over the next two-to-three decades, better-educated individuals leaving the workforce will be replaced by those who have lower levels of education and skills (Oleck, 2007). Students will be entering the workforce lacking the motivation, required skills, and behaviors that are needed to succeed in society. Self-determination theory (SDT) provides a broad framework for the study of human motivation and personality. Deci and Ryan (1985) developed this theory that distinguishes between intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation reflects an internally driven curiosity, interest, and passion. Extrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it leads to a separable outcome, such as receiving managerial praise or a monetary reward for delivering a good performance. This study explored what innovative teaching practices can be employed by faculty members to increase the self-determination (SD) levels of underperforming undergraduate students. The intent of the project was to provide educators with innovative insights and teaching tools that can be used to turn around and improve the low SD levels of these under-achieving students.

1669,"Stress, Health, and Coping: An Overview","New technologies, new multidisciplinary approaches, scientific curiosity, and popular demand have all contributed to the growth in the stress, coping, and health research enterprise over the past 30 years. Much of this research originally focused on establishing that stress was in fact harmful to mental and physical health. As these harmful effects became evident, interest grew in coping processes that could mitigate them. Then, in the 1990s, a number of factors converged to generate interest in resilience and well-being in the face of stress. The scope of coping expanded accordingly, and new forms of coping that generated and sustained resilience and well-being were identified and explored. The chapters in this volume are written by leaders in the field who offer authoritative reviews and provocative critiques of where the field is now and exciting previews of new directions in which stress and coping research is headed. <c2><a9> 2011 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

1670,Inside Learning Centers,"Learning centers are areas in a classroom, such as a corner in the room, that define a specific focus or afford a unique learning opportunity. Learning takes place when students reinforce skills by using the skills in interesting, meaningful, relevant, and social contexts. Learning centers can aid this reinforcement by giving students opportunities to participate in thought-provoking activities and by stimulating curiosity within a cooperative setting. Learning centers serve both a curriculum-centered and a child-centered approach to learning. Learning center activities can be organized by skills, novel interests, or integrated themes. Thematic centers are usually the most popular for teachers and students alike. Many center activities are game-like in nature, focusing on luck rather than ability. All center activities should include an objective, a set of directions, and a means of evaluation. Space availability, time constraints, and student movement all will affect the organization of learning centers. Learning centers offer another way to incorporate portfolio assessment into the classroom. The teacher must also carefully evaluate the effectiveness of the individual learning centers. Thus, with organization and creativity, learning centers can be a valuable addition to classrooms. (HB)","Cosgrove, Maryellen S",0,,1200
1671,The Paradox of Text: Will the Real Meaning Please Identify Itself?,"The central feature of language is symbolic meaning, and the act of reading is a part of the symbolic process that characterizes human life. Meaning occurs as a result of interpretation in a context, not as a result of response or reaction. Signs have a literal meaning in a specific context, while symbols have a figurative meaning in an implicit context of metaphor. A question of principle--how does what we read mean?--and a question of practice--how can reading be made meaningful?--may be posed. Perhaps the teaching of reading comes down to making reading more interesting and less tough. Two half-truths about meaning should be dispelled: that text has a single meaning and, at the opposite extreme, that a text means anything any reader wants to claim. In fact, meaning is not ""in"" anything because it is not a thing but a happening or process. To make reading meaningful, teachers can involve readers in decisions about text, after facilitating the connections on which meaning is built by asking questions. Their questions should be designed to elicit divergent and creative thinking and to build the curiosity and interest that might make reading more interesting and less tough. (Illustrative discussion questions are posed about a familiar nursery rhyme.) (GT)","Estes, Thomas H",0,,1201

1677,"Data privacy and dignitary privacy: Google spain, the right to be forgotten, and the construction of the public sphere","The 2014 decision of the European Court of Justice in Google Spain controversially held that the fair information practices set forth in European Union (EU) Directive 95/46/EC (Directive) require that Google remove from search results links to websites that contain true information. Google Spain held that the Directive gives persons a ""right to be forgotten."" At stake in Google Spain are values that involve both privacy and freedom of expression. Google Spain badly analyzes both. With regard to the latter, Google Spain fails to recognize that the circulation of texts of common interest among strangers makes possible the emergence of a ""public"" capable of forming the ""public opinion"" that is essential for democratic self-governance. As the rise of American newspapers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries demonstrates, the press underwrites the public sphere by creating a structure of communication both responsive to public curiosity and independent of the content of any particular news story. Google, even though it is not itself an author, sustains the contemporary virtual public sphere by creating an analogous structure of communication. With regard to privacy values, EU law, like the laws of many nations, recognizes two distinct forms of privacy. The first is data privacy, which is protected by the fair information practices contained in the Directive. These practices regulate the processing of personal information to ensure (among other things) that such information is used only for the specified purposes for which it has been legally gathered. Data privacy operates according to an instrumental logic, and it seeks to endow persons with ""control"" over their personal data. Data subjects need not demonstrate harm in order to establish violations of data privacy. The second form of privacy recognized by EU law is dignitary privacy. Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union protects the dignity of persons by regulating inappropriate communications that threaten to degrade, humiliate, or mortify them. Dignitary privacy follows a normative logic designed to prevent harm to personality caused by the violation of civility rules. There are the same privacy values as those safeguarded by the American tort of public disclosure of private facts. Throughout the world, courts protect dignitary privacy by balancing the harm that a communication may cause to personality against legitimate public interests in the communication. The instrumental logic of data privacy is inapplicable to public discourse, which is why the Directive contains derogations for journalistic activities. The communicative action characteristic of the public sphere is made up of intersubjective dialogue, which is antithetical both to the instrumental rationality of data privacy and to its aspiration to ensure individual control of personal information. Because the Google search engine underwrites the public sphere in which public discourse takes place, Google Spain should not have applied fair information practices to Google searches. But the Google Spain opinion also invokes Article 7, and in the end the decision creates doctrinal rules that are roughly approximate to those used to protect dignitary privacy. The Google Spain opinion is thus deeply confused about the kind of privacy it wishes to protect. It is impossible to ascertain whether the decision seeks to protect data privacy or dignitary privacy. Google Spain is ultimately pushed in the direction of dignitary privacy because data privacy is incompatible with public discourse, whereas dignitary privacy may be reconciled with the requirements of public discourse. Insofar as freedom of expression is valued because it fosters democratic self-government, public discourse cannot serve as an effective instrument of self-determination without a modicum of civility. Yet the Google Spain decision recognizes dignitary privacy only in a rudimentary and unsatisfactory way. If it had more clearly focused on the requirements of dignitary privacy, Google Spain would not so sharply have distinguished Google links from the underlying websites to which they refer. Google Spain would not have blithely outsourced the enforcement of the right to be forgotten to a private corporation like Google. <c2><a9> 2018 Robert C. Post.","Post, R C",0,,1205
1678,Increasing students' interest in chemistry with context-based approaches for control and assessment in the english language program at medical university in varna,"In the Department of Chemistry, University of Varna, Bulgaria, students of the English language course are thought for 5 years. There was a need for adaptation of chemistry curriculum to the needs and requirements of the new students. Recognizing that a graduate in chemistry has knowledge that is necessary for understanding of chemical principles applied in further study subjects, a context- based approach is used in chemistry practice and lectures. Increasing the students' interest to chemistry as a preclinical discipline aims to motivate their curiosity and help them learn. Based on the Bloom's taxonomy we suggest the students 6 types of tasks for the laboratory and seminar works. We use the tasks for control as well as for assessment. Using a well-known guideline, students perform the seminar and practical work and get used to follow instructions, an approach often used in the physicians' practice. The topic ""Amino acids"" is proposed as an example how the experimental procedure is compared to a clinical procedure.","Peteva, Z and Makedonski, L and Stancheva, M",0,,1206

1683,Project-Based Science to Increase Language Ability in Early Childhood,"Indeed early childhood is ready to learn many things including science. Great curiosity in children is a potential that can be exploited to introduce various concepts of science through exploration, observation and experimentation in the context of play. Children love to explore the surroundings with their senses, investigate objects, and make experiments in their daily activities, including playing. Science is a science based on findings through investigations and experiments. So it is possible to introduce science to children through project activities. Project-based science is a very interesting activity for children, because through this activity various abilities of children can be developed including the ability of children's language. Investigation activities develop the child's ability to present ideas, make inquiries, make notes, and propose arguments. Exploration activities develop the child's ability to discover new concepts, new words and new meanings. The experimental activity develops the child's ability to understand the stages of activity and the various rules.

The adapted and modified version of CAME, which we have called CAME-M/J, and the cited personality scales were completed by a sample of 470 8th grade students (mean age of 13.64 yrs). Next, the questionnaire designed to evaluate the viewing of, and interest in violent films was completed. The results show good convergent validity, internal consistency and test-retest reliability. The P scale of the EPQ/J and the Disinhibition scale (Dis) and Thrill and Adventure Seeking scale (TAS) of the SSS/J relate to the consumption of violent films in boys, and E and TAS in girls. Boys who watch more violent films are rated as being more aggressive and excitable by their teachers. Multiple regression analyses show the personality variables P and Dis to be the best predictors of the CAME-M/J scale in boys, and in girls Dis, P and TAS. The results are compared with those obtained by Zuckerman and Litle (1986).

1686,The effects of an enrichment program on intrinsic motivation for achievement in third and fourth grade children,"Leonardo's Laboratory is modeled after Renzulli's Type III Enrichment program. Twenty-nine, eight, nine and ten year-old, third and fourth graders, from an inner city school district, who demonstrated strength in the visual-perceptual/visual spatial realm, but were challenged academically, participated in this nine week, two hour weekly, after school program. The focus was on the students developing their personal best, strengthening their time management skills, self-efficacy beliefs, feelings of competency and intrinsic motivation for achievement. The belief that children can increase their intrinsic motivation for achievement if they feel more confident with the things that they do successfully; and that the children will want to try more difficult tasks because they have experienced success at a similar task sparked this study. Using Susan Harter's Scale of Intrinsic Versus Extrinsic Orientation in the Classroom (1980) the children's individual preference for a challenge, curiosity/interest, independent mastery, independent judgment and internal criteria was measured compared for their preference for easy work, pleasing the teacher and getting good grades, dependence on the teacher and reliance on the teacher's judgment; and external criteria. A Multivariate Analysis of a Covariance (MANCOVA) was completed. The classroom teachers reported that the children were generally more motivated to learn in school and wanted better grades. However, the MANCOVA testing the hypothesis for group difference was not statistically significant. The study results were discussed as well as limitations. Future areas of research were identified.

1688,The Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire: Development and preliminary validation,"This paper reports on three studies on the development and validation of the Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ), a brief, multidimensional self-report measure that assesses parental reflective functioning or mentalizing, that is, the capacity to treat the infant as a psychological agent. Study 1 investigated the factor structure, reliability, and relationships of the PRFQ with demographic features, symptomatic distress, attachment dimensions, and emotional availability in a socially diverse sample of 299 mothers of a child aged 0 +/- 3. In Study 2, the factorial invariance of the PRFQ in mothers and fathers was investigated in a sample of 153 first-time parents, and relationships with demographic features, symptomatic distress, attachment dimensions, and parenting stress were investigated. Study 3 investigated the relationship between the PRFQ and infant attachment classification as assessed with the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP) in a sample of 136 community mothers and their infants. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggested three theoretically consistent factors assessing pre-mentalizing modes, certainty about the mental states of the infant, and interest and curiosity in the mental states of the infant. These factors were generally related in theoretically expected ways to parental attachment dimensions, emotional availability, parenting stress, and infant attachment status in the SSP. Yet, at the same time, more research on the PRFQ is needed to further establish its reliability and validity.

1691,"Review of Rethinking children and families: The relationship between childhood, families and the state","Reviews the book, Rethinking children and families: The relationship between childhood, families and the state by Nick Frost (2011). The book aims at a broad audience including students, practitioners and professionals and promises to extend readers insights on the relationship between childhood, families and the State. The author draws a triangular model of relationships between the state, families and children, setting out the strength of influence on each other. The book clearly fosters curiosity and interest in studies on children, families and the State by showing the many facets this topic and highlighting some of the complex relationships. The book succeeds in highlighting complexity and movement in the contemporary conceptualization of childhood and children's relation to parents and to the State and in demonstrating how currently hot debates can be informed by empirical research and theory development.

1692,Grafting: Making Space for International and Comparative Education in a Pre-Service Teacher Social Foundations Class,"This article contributes to a growing appreciation and understanding of both the ways to include exposure to Comparative and International Education (CIE) in undergraduate teacher education as well as to how students take up and respond creatively to opportunities for comparative exploration. In order to make space for comparative education in the already oversubscribed pre-service teacher's program of study, we (1) explore a strategy to use a required undergraduate social foundations' class for pre-service teachers at a large public university as a platform for comparative education, and (2) share the lessons learned from creating space for students to express their international and comparative curiosities. We open the article by introducing the ""grafting"" strategy to make space for the comparative; we then turn to the ways we employed a pedagogical tool we call ""drawing out"" to allow students to make comparative connections by responding to our deliberate, comparative prompts. We found that by embracing the grafting approach we created opportunities for students to make their own conclusions about the value of comparative considerations and to express their organic interest in the international to better understand domestic developments and options.","Shah, Payal and Brown, Kara D",0,,1218
1693,MORE MOTIVATIONAL ASPECTS OF AN IMAGERY MNEMONIC,"Mnemonics research has focused on cognitive aspects of mnemonics. This study explored some motivational aspects of mnemonics-factors that can affect how much people might want to use mnemonics. It was hypothesized that using a mnemonic can make learning easier and more fun. College students used the rhyming peg mnemonic to learn 12 sayings (e.g. `Curiosity killed the cat'). The students rated the task as being easier (lower difficulty and effort) than did control students who learned the sayings without the mnemonic. There was also a tendency for the mnemonic students to rate the task as being more fun (higher interest and enjoyability), although behavioural measures of interest did not support the ratings. The mnemonic students also recalled more sayings than did the control students. The results suggest that, in addition to the cognitive effectiveness of mnemonics in increasing recall, mnemonics might also have the potential to make learning easier and possibly more fun.","HIGBEE, K L",0,10.1002/acp.2350080102,1219
1694,"Altruism, welfare and the law","Given the centrality to family law of the concepts of welfare and best interests, it is noteworthy, though probably unsurprising, that judges have tended to show little curiosity in teasing out what these very familiar words mean. More puzzling is why the Academy should have shown so little interest. There is an important doctoral thesis waiting to be written on the history of the welfare principle and of how the understanding and application of the concept has changed down the years. It would require the skills of someone who is both a black-letter legal historian and a legal sociologist, which is perhaps why it has not yet been done. This is not that book, but it is, if anything, even more important It is an examination of the issue from an ethical and philosophical perspective by two distinguished academics. They emphasize the importance of understanding the particular unique child or incapacitous adult in the particular circumstances he or she is in and the relationships within which the child or incapacities adult lives. They argue that our task is to enable children and adults lacking capacity to flourish in the context of good relationships. But, they emphasise, good relationships entail give and take, and responsibilities as well as rights. Accordingly, they suggest, properly understood, the notions of well-being and best interests include relationality, altruism and virtue.

1695,Public areas of cruise ships,"The modern cruise ships have become a destination on their own as a result of the project's design and not of the charm and history. The ship is designed to arouse desire and interest and to be discovered by the customer day after day. The goal is achieved by building fantastic realities in the interior architecture and design, improved by continuous and renewable sources of attraction, curiosity and fun. Within that system, it is the public areas that play the role of a pole of attraction and entertainment for the passenger and determine the overall standard of the ship. They are places of entertainment, gaming, socializing and last but not least, are a source of income for the shipping companies. The public areas are what unite cruising people, heterogeneous by age, social background and place of origin. The large surface area is destined to be public areas that allow to the design places highly diversified, responsive to every need of the tourist. Casinos, theme restaurants, shopping center, rock climbing, coiffeur. constitute the ""facilities"" on board. It is precisely the attractions that have made the success of the cruise ship, once identified as travel for elderly spouses, today is open to families and groups of friends. The holiday is structured around the activities and public areas that underlie it. The entire day is punctuated by numerous moments of food in bars and restaurants. Relaxation is guaranteed by the reading rooms, cinema and spa. It is thus clear that the main attraction of the cruise is the set of services offered and not the destination of the ship. The paper analyzes the public areas on the latest cruise ships, defining goals and their evolution, by associating the images and description of illustrative diagrams of the distribution planning. <c2><a9> 2015 Organising Committee NAV 2015.","Zignego, M I",0,,1221

1700,The Convergence into an Ideal Thought: Critical Thinking and Metacognition,"Universal Design for Learning (UDL), an instructional practice for curriculum design, brims with the promise that concepts, however challenging, may be accessible to everyone in a classroom. There is no reason for anyone, including children in special education programs, not to have the right of passage into inquiry within a unit of study. To achieve this purpose, the UDL model for learning includes differentiated instruction as well as pre-determined skill sets necessary to construct models of analytical understanding. However, teachers still need to prompt learners, and open up learners' self-awareness and interests in order to kindle a curiosity in life. This article discusses the importance of engaging students through a catalyst known as metacognition--a best practice no less important than the methods that teachers use to achieve critical understanding in students.","Bennett, Mark",0,,1223
1701,The Psychology and Neuroscience of Curiosity,"Curiosity is a basic element of our cognition, but its biological function, mechanisms, and neural underpinning remain poorly understood. It is nonetheless a motivator for learning, influential in decision-making, and crucial for healthy development. One factor limiting our understanding of it is the lack of a widely agreed upon delineation of what is and is not curiosity. Another factor is the dearth of standardized laboratory tasks that manipulate curiosity in the lab. Despite these barriers, recent years have seen a major growth of interest in both the neuroscience and psychology of curiosity. In this Perspective, we advocate for the importance of the field, provide a selective overview of its current state, and describe tasks that are used to study curiosity and information-seeking. We propose that, rather than worry about defining curiosity, it is more helpful to consider the motivations for information-seeking behavior and to study it in its ethological context.","Kidd, Celeste and Hayden, Benjamin Y.",0,10.1016/j.neuron.2015.09.010,1224
1702,EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENT FACTORS OF UNIVERSITY LECTURERS,"In the context of the knowledge society the university teachers face increasing challenges. They are required a wide range of education as well as a constant desire for improvement fallowing up and applying innovations in their work. This article examines the teaching of a university lecturer in a non-formal or an informal way in order to find out what factors lead by representatives of this field trying to improve their competencies as the knowledge creator and disseminator. The survey was conducted by interviewing university lecturers during a semi-structured interview. The results of empirical research have shown that non-formal or informal learning for teachers is an integral part of their professional activity and they tend to pursue their personal interests in the most part in gaining knowledge or new experience to satisfy their curiosity, to satisfy students or to overcome certain challenges. In the professional environment, the impetus for learning is felt through the improvement of the quality of students and lectures, the desire to be equal partners in science to their colleagues and the perception that the teaching profession requires multidisciplinarity. Continuous learning has also been identified as a condition for pursuing a career or simply to maintain a job and meet the high academic requirements of the teaching profession.","Rutkiene, Ausra and Anclauskaite, Jolita",0,10.17770/sie2018vol1.3160,1225
1703,Prevalence and characterizations of current smoking habit of Iranian Medical University students: A cross-sectional study in mental health,"Background: This cross sectional study was carried out on medical university students of Iran. Materials and Methods: A total of 500 participants from a total of 1866 followed the criteria of the study. The mean age was 24.6 +/- 3.3 SD, males 70% and females 30%. Results: The prevalence of smokers was 27%, and their initiation into smoking had occurred under 18 years of age (89.6%). The result shows that, males were more likely to smoke than females. The data on unemployment, marriage, residency in Tehran, no resident dormitory and a wealthy background had meaningful frequency. In addition, data on family conflicts and separation were low in frequency. Ages 20-25 had a high frequency (56.6%). The consumption of up to 20 cigarettes per day was found highest in the 20-25 class at a rate of 32.6%, which is quite alarming. Motivations for taking up smoking were curiosity friends' interest and family, and were insignificant as habit, hobby and depression. Shisha was used (72.2%) more than other nicotine delivery packages. Conclusion: A noticeable prevalence current smoking habits was observed among medical students. Therefore, universities should issue nonsmoking regulations and awareness program among students which will significantly affect the national health.

Our aim is to present these ideas in user-friendly, accessible language, with examples to illustrate their use. The article is organised around three main themes: how a family system gets organised; how systemic work helps to effect change in families; and how a systemic therapist creates a context for change. Ideas covered include circular patterns, processes and questions, feedback loops, the importance of context, the interdependence of meaning and action, taking a meta-perspective, systemic hypothesising, neutrality, curiosity, second-order change, use of language and the position of the therapist. The article may be of particular interest to those who are new to systemic ideas, as well as for those involved in providing training in systemic practice.","Garven, R and White, H",0,10.1375/anft.30.3.196,1227

Three studies provide the first extensive effort to understand the correlates of the search for meaning in a multistudy research program. Assessed were relations between search for meaning and wellbeing, cognitive style, and the Big Five, Big Three, Approach/Avoidance, and Interest models of personality, with a particular emphasis on understanding the correlates of search for meaning that are independent of presence of meaning. Conceptual models of the relation between search and presence were tested. Findings suggest that people lacking meaning search for it; the search for meaning did not appear to lead to its presence. Study 3 found that basic motive dispositions moderated relations between search for meaning and its presence. Results highlight the importance of basic personality dispositions in understanding the search for meaning and its correlates.

Observations were made by means of closed circuit TV. Animate stimuli elicited considerably more interest than the inanimate stimulus. The more vulnerable species, the slow loris, displayed as much curiosity as the less vulnerable species, the greater galago; but, in the presence of live stimuli, lorises were more cautious. They moved slowly and silently, employed contact as a mode of investigation significantly less often than galagos, spent significantly less time than galagos investigating from within 3 ft, took significantly longer than galagos to make their first approaches to within the 3-ft zone, and, once there, stayed for significantly shorter visits than galagos. Data demonstrate that prosimians are highly responsive to novelty if the stimuli are appropriate and that it is important to take into account not just whether animals investigate but also how they investigate.

Lee et al., 2017) of the Planned Happenstance Career Inventory (PHCI; B. Kim, Jung, et al., 2014) across cultures. Participants were 262 American and 291 South Korean undergraduates. Measurement invariance results indicated that the 5-factor structure was adequate for both groups and that conditions for configural, metric, and partial intercept invariance were met. Latent mean analysis was used to compare the mean scores of the PHCI skills (curiosity, flexibility, persistence, optimism, and risk taking). The latent means of curiosity, flexibility, persistence, and optimism were higher among South Korean undergraduates, but no significant difference was found regarding risk taking. Career counselors should consider differences in planned happenstance perceptions across cultures to provide better career guidance. Future studies are needed to verify the distinctive nature of flexibility by replicating the factor structure of the PHCI with other samples.

The nature of each dimension (Joyous Exploration, Deprivation Sensitivity, Stress Tolerance, Social curiosity, and Thrill-Seeking) and of profiles based on those dimensions were examined as well as their relationships with value-driven actions (Personal Well-being, Moral values, Religious values, Social Ideology, and Environment.) Results of qualitative and quantitative analyses shed light on the role of positive uncertainty (stress tolerance) and of thrill-seeking in shaping epistemic and social curiosity; on authentic descriptions of reactions to curiosity-related objects or situations; on types of questions of interest that are more likely to be posed by curious people, and on values that drive their actions. The findings were discussed from an educative perspective.","Birenbaum, Menucha and Nasser-Abu Alhija, Fadia and Shilton, Hany and Kimron, Helena and Rosanski, Rovena and Shahor, Neria",0,10.1016/j.paid.2019.05.038,1232
1716,Using Films to Learn about the Nature of Cross-Cultural Stereotypes in Intercultural Business Communication Courses,"Instructors of intercultural business communication courses inevitably face the challenge of providing cross-cultural experiences in the classroom, and students are eager to have real exposure to other cultures. One way of simulating the feel of entering another culture is through films. As Mallinger and Rossy (2003) state, films are a ""uniquely rich medium for the purpose of studying culture."" One of the primary benefits, particularly among university students, is that films are entertaining, engaging, and in many cases stimulate curiosity toward other cultures. This article provides a way of teaching about the recent award-winning film ""Slumdog Millionaire."" It shows how this film can be used in direct reference to concepts related to stereotypes--concepts that are discussed in most prominent intercultural communication textbooks. It also illustrates how survey results of Indians about their attitudes toward the movie can enrich the class discussion and preserve the voice of the culture of interest.

1721,Social interaction facilitated by a minimally-designed robot: Findings from longitudinal therapeutic practices for autistic children,"This paper reports our longitudinal observation of unconstrained child-robot interaction at a daycare center for autistic children. We used a simple robot, Keepon, that is only capable of expressing its attention (directing its gaze) and emotions (pleasure and excitement). While controlled by a remote experimenter, Keepon interacted with the children with its simple appearance and actions. With a sense of curiosity and security, the children spontaneously approached Keepon and engaged in dyadic interaction with it, which then extended to triadic interactions where they exchanged with adult caregivers pleasure and surprise found in Keepon. The three-year-long observation suggests that autistic children possess the motivation to share mental states with others, which is contrary to the commonly held position that the motivation is impaired in autism. Autistic children, however, have difficulty rather in sifting out socially meaningful information (e.g., attention and emotions) from flooding perceptual information. Keepon, with its minimal expressiveness, directly conveyed socially meaningful information to the children, which activated their intact motivation to share interests and feelings with others. We conclude that social filtering is one of the prerequisites for interpersonal communication and that robots like Keepon can facilitate social filtering and its development in autistic children.","Kozima, Hideki and Yasuda, Yuriko and Nakagawa, Cocoro",0,,1234
1723,The psychology of the nursery,"The problem which underlies all nursery life is the Child's Adjustment to Society. Every child is born with an internal urge to completeness- a deep-seated biological force within his nature. Certain tendencies hold him back: 1. The Call of the Cradle. We retard a child's character development when we make infancy or invalidism too attractive. 2. Tendency to Sensation-mongering. All children are born with the desire to attract attention. The child who is given adequate opportunity for achievement will lose interest in causing sensations. The sensation-mongering child is the potential hysteric. The factor of Fear in the life of the Child: (a) Fear of capture. (b) Fear of the unknown. All such should be very tenderly dealt with. Immense harm may be done to the child by repression of a fear. The factor of Curiosity. This is a primitive instinct working for the development of the Child and the Race. The Child's Curiosity with regard to Sex Knowledge is thoroughly wholesome and should be immediately and fully satisfied. The right use of Authority in the Nursery. The child can very early assimilate the idea of social responsibility. He can easily understand that authority is not autocratic, but is based upon the claims of the Herd. The Value of Nature as a teacher. What a Child learns for himself from natural forces is much more valuable to him than what is inculcated by an adult. (a) Educational value of Camping. (b) Educational value of Sea-training. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Miller, H Crichton",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/14841-010,1235
1724,Implementing shared treatment decision making and treatment decision aids: A cautionary tale,"Clinical and research interest in shared treatment decision making (STDM) and decision aids (DA) evolved in the 1980's and 1990's with an initial focus on patients with cancer, and particularly, women with breast cancer. This interest has undergone a shift in emphasis over time from curiosity about the meaning of these concepts and their potential to improve patient participation in treatment decision making to wide scale endorsement, attempts to expand implementation in a variety of clinical settings, measurement of multiple outcomes at the clinical and public policy level, and the development of standardized criteria for evaluating DA. In this chapter we raise the question: are we moving too fast to promote implementation of STDM and DA before resolving important challenges that still exist about the meaning and merits of these initiatives? We discuss four such challenges: i) ambiguity and inconsistency in the defi nition of STDM, ii) variations in patient and physician preferences for STDM, iii) the increase in the number and range of goals defi ned for STDM and /or DA to achieve, and iv) the lack of well documented theoretical and empirical support for criteria to be used in evaluating DA quality, and potentially for purposes of DA certifi cation. These fi ndings suggest the need for caution, for more thoughtful analysis, and additional research on the challenges raised above prior to wide scale endorsement of STDM and DA in routine clinical practice.","Charles, C and Gafni, A and Freeman, E",0,,1236

It is no longer a matter of using multimedia equipment in classroom but fundamentally to look for new more appropriate and captivating contents to present to the new plugged students. Besides all of the technical and pedagogic aspects it is necessary to think about the psychological aspects of this great and passionate process of teaching. For the good or for the evil, there it is this new socioeconomic and political world of contrasts in which only the education can really change for better. Speaking about education for best the professionals who leave the universities today leave already with a stock of knowledge that is partly obsolete and s/he has to run fast to adapt to the new job market. Is this the fault of the University? No, the University has been serving the society for centuries and without interests others than the investigation and the improvement of the knowledge that generates benefits for the humanity as a whole. What about the teacher? The new teacher has to preserve the curiosity, to urge the capacity of the students' inquiry; he has to teach them to learn and not to suffocate them with a mountain of scientific and technological knowledge, that today the teacher does in the anguish of teaching better.

1728,A novel method for resource discovery from a range based request in a,"Peer to Peer (P2P) systems have increased the curiosity and pathways for people to discover and share the resources. While various methods have been proposed in the discovery of discrete value based resources, there is also a surging interest in discovering a range of resources for a given request. This work is a novel design of a P2P network that adheres to range requests and seeks to discover the resources sought for in the request. The proposed model seeks to find out the range of resource values from within a P2P network of nodes that are in a circular overlay structure. The validation of the design reaches the conclusion that the proposed model increases in efficiency as the number of hubs increases with respect to discovering a range of resources in the hubs.","Krishnaprasad, T R and Sajeev, G P",0,,1240

The main aim of this track was that the most number of teaching experiences that involves robots were presented in order that the participants can exchange their experiences. As a result, a group of proposals, whose common denominator is to provide experiences and innovative practices within the Educational Robotics, is presented. In most of them, competitions activities appear as the main motivation tools. But the target group is highly diversified, so it has be shown that Robotics can be seen as the target as well as the tool in teaching process.","Curto, B and Moreno, V",0,10.1145/2536536.2536580,1241
1731,Review of A guide for the statistically perplexed: Selected readings for clinical researchers,"Reviews the book, A Guide for the Statistically Perplexed: Selected Readings for Clinical Researchers by David L. Streiner (2013). As the title suggests, this is a book primarily intended for clinical researchers. It will also be of interest to non researchers seeking to hone their understanding of statistical procedures they encounter in their reading. The title of the book refers to statistical perplexity. This may create a perception that the book is targeted toward readers who are puzzled by statistics. In fact, Dr Streiner views perplexity as a positive trait-one that stands in opposition to ""blithe ignorance""Introduction, p ix or a willingness to passively accept statistical claims or to use statistical techniques without understanding. Perplexity is taken as a sign of thoughtfulness and curiosity, a precursor to competence rather than a threat to it. The book has an informal and attractive appearance, and is free of production errors. It can be read cover-to-cover as a sweeping and thoughtful overview of important statistical issues. It will also be a useful reference source when one encounters unfamiliar methods or puzzling statistical results while reading the clinical research literature. This book is a useful antidote to the sense of perplexity that should arise in these situations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Patten, Scott B",0,,1242
1733,Perceptions of Israeli mathematics teachers regarding their professional development needs,"Recent reforms in mathematics education have increased the need for teachers to attend professional development programs. In order to motivate teachers to attend such programs and to maximize their effect on teachers' development, we believe it is important to adapt the contents of such programs to teachers' perceived needs. The current study was designed to explore the professional needs of Israeli mathematics teachers, as they perceived them. Our results show that teachers are mainly concerned with developing their mathematical knowledge and acquiring knowledge that relates to the way in which students comprehend various mathematical concepts. However, these concerns stem from different positions that can be attributed to their teaching experience: New teachers appear to be self-centered; therefore their concern with developing their knowledge might be a result of a need to gain self-confidence. More experienced teachers are able to consider the effect of their teaching on students' learning, and it appears that their wish to acquire knowledge stems from this perspective. Highly experienced teachers, like new teachers, are also self-centered, believing they know everything about teaching and learning, and therefore express interest in acquiring knowledge merely for satisfying their own curiosity. <c2><a9> 2012 International Professional Development Association (IPDA).","Shriki, A and Lavy, I",0,10.1080/19415257.2011.626062,1243

Discussion of injuries is acceptable when it is controlled by the wishes of the injured man, but is objectionable when it represents idle curiosity. Staring is an invasion of privacy which the injured man can not control. His acceptance or rejection of his injury determines his perception of the other person's attitude and interest. Talking about implications of the injury may aid his outlook. Avoiding the topic makes the injured man more insecure and sensitive, rather than resolving his conflicting feelings.

1737,Determinants of arts festival participation: An investigation of Macao residents,"Arts festivals target a diverse body of audience, and the participation of local residents to a large extent defines the event success. However, little has been known regarding what local attendees expect, how they perceive the value or benefits, and in which way they get involved in these festivals. Based on a survey on 159 local respondents attending the 2009 Macao Arts Festival, this study has examined a range of factors that may have pulled and pushed local resident of Macao to attend and participate in the annual festival. For comparative purposes, up to 379 local respondents who did not attend the festival were also investigated. It is found that local attendees' participation is largely determined by festival participation frequency, convenience of purchasing tickets, personal curiosity about unique performances, and interest in arts appreciation. In addition, there exists a significant, positive relationship between the overall satisfaction of local festival attendees and their intention to return in future. Local nonattendees in general have poorer perception of the festival's pull factors. They are interested in arts, but their participation is constrained by a number of external barriers. The information revealed is helpful to improving the current practices of governments and organizers in the program design and marketing of urban arts festivals. Important research implications of the results are also drawn.

Visitors participated in a structured interview about two exhibits they found interesting at the time of the initial visit and one month later. Participants retained stable episodic memories of the exhibits they chose, independently of whether or not they had discussed the exhibit in detail with the interviewer in the first interview. As to change in semantic memory, for some particpants the memories were enhanced between the initial and follow-up interview, for some they remained stable, and for others they deteriorated. There was an approximately equal proportion in each category. All participants reported affective involvement at both interview times, with happiness, followed by curiosity, being the most common. Post-visit integration of the exhibit information was common. The majority of participants reported talking to others about the exhibits. Moreover, one-third of the participants reported linking the exhibit memories to everyday occurrences, thus indicating an increased awareness of scientific phenomenon.","Medved, M I and Oatley, K",0,10.1080/095006900429475,1249
1743,Bridging Early Childhood and Nature Education. Proceedings of the Roger Tory Peterson Institute of Natural History Forum (1990),"This report was written to extend the findings of the Roger Tory Peterson Institute's 1990 forum on early-childhood environmental education. The report begins with an overview of Peterson's own childhood experiences that influenced his career as a naturalist. Peterson developed a hands-on interest in nature as a very young boy. His case is not uncommon. Educators have long realized the value of experiential education for elementary students. Nature education helps children gain a respect for life, stimulates their curiosity, and provides them with meaningful life experiences. Nature study is defined as a platform for engaging the whole child in experiences that provide a basis for understanding environmental relationships. It can take place in any location where the natural world is observed. Participants in the Peterson forum agreed that nature-education activities for young children should differ from those planned for older children. Foremost among guidelines for selecting young children's nature activities is the goal of providing them with firsthand experiences. It is important to keep nature experiences developmentally appropriate in terms of both age and individuality. Developmental appropriateness provides a framework for selecting learning experiences that are compatible with predictable sequences of growth and change within young children. The document offers goals and guidelines for selecting nature-study activities, and discusses bird-watching and nature walks, two activities teachers can choose.

1747,Online delivery for effective learning experience: Consideration and conceptualization for further advancement,"Teaching and learning via online delivery is increasingly becoming a norm for many higher education institutions worldwide. This alternative form of learning is characteristically unique and serves a number of purposes - for example, it is cost-effective and convenient for full-time workers who wish to pursue academic studies, part-time. Consequently, the acceptance of this mode has led to a rethinking in pedagogical strategies for educators and researchers alike. Educators and researchers have developed and used a myriad of innovations (e.g., animated pedagogical agents) to stimulate students' interests, intellectual curiosities, and to enhance critical thinking skills. Despite the effectiveness and advantages of online delivery, there are a number of pressing issues for continuing consideration and research development. Notably, one aspect that has received appreciable emphases is the cultivation of a social milieu, online, that may yield characteristics reflective of a traditional, face-to-face (FTF) classroom. Noteworthy of this, for example, is a need for us to create a sense of realism (e.g., dynamic interaction) in students' learning. In a similar manner, there is recognition for educators to emulate a learning climate that binds learners, disregard of time and geographical differences. This feat, in our view, is not simplistic and entails a number of complexities that require continuing conceptualization. The main tenet of this chapter details a brief theoretical overview of online delivery in higher education contexts, and three identified issues that relate dialectically to this pedagogical approach to teaching and learning: (i) experiential feelings of realism; (ii) the facilitation, if possible, of critical thinking skills in an online learning climate; and (iii) the importance of cognitive overload in the presentation of information for online learning. We conclude this chapter with a scoping of recommendations for continuing research development and advancement. There are, in this analysis, a number of pressing issues for educators and researchers to consider - for example, how does the paradigm of online delivery relate to individuals' cognitive processes for learning?. <c2><a9> 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

1748,Young Children's Curiosity About Physical Differences Associated with Race: Shared Reading to Encourage Conversation,"Many have called for re-examination of the ``colorblind'' philosophy to which some early educators have, tacitly or explicitly, adhered (e.g. Boutte et al. 2011; Derman-Sparks and Edwards 2010; Husband 2012). It has been argued that, while colorblind approaches may appear to be politically neutral, they actually exacerbate racial oppression. In this article, we advocate for a direct and active approach to raising conversations about race with younger preschool children. Based on the developmental nature of young children's concepts of self and of other, our focus is on initiating discussions about concrete and observable physical aspects of human diversity associated with race. Young children notice and are curious about differences in skin color, hair texture, and facial features. Because these differences are salient, are accessible, and are of interest to young children they can serve as an effective starting point. We suggest shared reading of high quality illustrated children's books, incorporating the principles of dialogic reading, as a potent springboard for discussions about race with very young children. Our purpose is to equip children, very early in their schooling, with a color-filled appreciation for and comfort with physical diversity of appearance. On that foundation, children may better proceed on the course of developing anti-racist attitudes.","Kemple, Kristen M and Lee, Il Rang and Harris, Michelle",0,10.1007/s10643-014-0683-0,1255
1749,The beginnings of intelligence,"We all have a certain curiosity regarding the evolutionary history of our various powers and attributes, but from many points of view an unusual interest attaches to the first development of intelligence. In considering the origin of intelligence one is naturally led to the subject of the relation of intelligence to instinct. With the establishment of the theory of evolution writers became more disposed to discover the kinship and filiation of instinct and intelligence and they have given us a variety of views as to the relation of these faculties. It will be seen in this chapter that the adaptiveness of intelligence is based upon the adaptiveness of instinct; it may be said that intelligence is a means of enabling an animal to live its life more completely and successfully, but instinct furnishes the fundamental springs of action.

1750,Integrating Introductory Data Science into Computer and Information Literacy through Collaborative Project-based Learning,"In this era of technology and science, data skills are critical for full participation in the workforce and contemporary society. Alarmingly not all graduates exit college with what are nothing less than survival skills.The goals of the course curriculum innovation are to raise the awareness of data science, promote retention, increase the interest and curiosity, and boost essential data skills for all students on campus. These goals are similar to existing efforts on the design of introductory data science courses for majors and non-majors. The distinctiveness of this course curriculum resides in hands-on learning by examples, case studies, and team-based projects within a low-stakes format, where students from different disciplines early in their college careers collaborated to ethically solve problems in the repetition of data science life cycles. The Innovative Practice Category Work in Progress paper presents our experience in integrating introductory data science into a college-wide computer and information literacy course via collaborative practices of exemplar and project-based learning. The collaborative learning with wide interdisciplinary focus enriched our pedagogues and scalability. Its effectiveness has been measured in a poster session and student perceptions on 5-point Likert scales. Furthermore, integrating introductory data science into a computer and information literacy course served to optimize existing educational resources and facilitate multiple pathways in college.

1751,The relation of the child to the animal,"Since the child is not an undeveloped adult but an individual in his own right, we must expect him to have his own characteristic attitudes towards animals. The method used in this study consisted in confronting children, from 5 months to 11 years old, with dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, white mice, chickens, goldfish, snails, worms, and frogs, and noting their behavior. At an age of 6 or 7 months children showed only grasping movements; at 11 months fear and curiosity could be noticed. At 3 years a child's personality begins to determine his reactions; a boy of this age shows concrete interest in what the animal can do, while a girl shows a more personal and emotional reaction like tenderness. The behavior of the child is also determined by the kind of animal he meets. He regards an animal as an individual and not as a type or a representative of a species. 31 references.

1752,What determines holidaying interest? Extrinsic versus intrinsic motivations,"Motivation is a crucial subject because it is known to influence behavior in every domain, including tourism. In tourism research, there have inter alia been debates on a theoretical level about whether extrinsic or intrinsic motivations exert the strongest impact on people's desire to travel for pleasure. Since there does not exist a single work on tourism motivation that empirically addresses this puzzle, this study, by applying an evolutionary approach, examines whether extrinsic or intrinsic factors have the strongest direct effect on people's interest for holidaying. This study represented the extrinsic motivations with two culturally related variables (vertical and horizontal cultural transmission), and captured the intrinsic motivations with two psychological variables (perceptual and epistemic curiosity). Two competing structural models were then constructed and ran on the basis of data collected from a sample (N=1001) of the Norwegian population in 2010. The results show that the extrinsic model is superior to the intrinsic model, which suggests that sociocultural factors have a stronger direct effect on people's interest for holidaying than do psychological factors. Further, the analysis shows both that the extrinsic and intrinsic motivations together explain a considerable share of the variation in interest for holidaying, and that horizontal cultural transmission has the strongest influence on holidaying interest. This study concludes with a discussion of the main theoretical and practical implications. <c2><a9> 2012 Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology.","Mehmetoglu, M",0,10.1037/h0099222,1259
1753,Identifying the neural substrates of intrinsic motivation during task performance,"Intrinsic motivation is the inherent tendency to seek out novelty and challenge, to explore and investigate, and to stretch and extend one's capacities. When people imagine performing intrinsically motivating tasks, they show heightened anterior insular cortex (AIC) activity. To fully explain the neural system of intrinsic motivation, however, requires assessing neural activity while people actually perform intrinsically motivating tasks (i.e., while answering curiosity-inducing questions or solving competence-enabling anagrams). Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that the neural system of intrinsic motivation involves not only AIC activity, but also striatum activity and, further, AIC-striatum functional interactions. These findings suggest that subjective feelings of intrinsic satisfaction (associated with AIC activations), reward processing (associated with striatum activations), and their interactions underlie the actual experience of intrinsic motivation. These neural findings are consistent with the conceptualization of intrinsic motivation as the pursuit and satisfaction of subjective feelings (interest and enjoyment) as intrinsic rewards.","Lee, Woogul and Reeve, Johnmarshall",0,10.3758/s13415-017-0524-x,1260

The author's two books on the uses of emotion and emotional experience in psychoanalysis evoke the incredible richness of ""working"" intimately with others-whether spiritually, medically or psychologically. The first book tackles the emotions that the author believes guide the analyst as she seeks connection with her patient. Beginning with curiosity,the author suggests that the analyst's curiosity challenges assumptions held by both patient and analyst. The first book highlight the author's passion about the use of emotions in treatment, she has another abiding interest-the training and supervision of psychoanalysts. Turning to the author's second book, the author contends that the clinician will have most impact if she is in touch with her ""whole system of emotions"" , a system that includes shame, regret, joy, grief, and anger. What ""makes a difference"" is sorting out the balance or effect of each emotion. Finally, there are those who might quibble with the author's model of therapeutic action; for example, her openly engaged interpersonal stance may not sit well with practitioners from different schools, such as Ego or Self psychology.

1755,"Comprehensive handbook of psychological assessment, Vol. 2: Personality assessment","In considering how the field of psychological assessment has evolved over the last century with the resulting explosion of new technologies and new assessment devices, it seemed to us imperative to create a resource (Comprehensive Handbook of Psychological Assessment: CHOPA) that distilled this vast reservoir of data in a more manageable format for researchers, clinicians, educators, and students alike. Therefore, Tracey Belmont, our editor at John Wiley & Sons, the volume editors (Gerald Goldstein, Sue R. Beers, Mark J. Hilsenroth, Daniel L. Segal, Stephen N. Haynes, Elaine M. Heiby, and Jay C. Thomas), and I as editor-in-chief developed this four-volume format. This decision was both conceptual, in order to best capture the scope of the field, and pragmatic, so that individuals wishing to purchase a single volume (as a consequence of their unique interest) would be able to do so. CHOPA includes four volumes with a total of 121 chapters written by renowned experts in their respective areas of expertise. In order the volumes are: 1, Intellectual and Neuropsychological Assessment; 2, Personality Assessment; 3, Behavioral Assessment; and 4, Industrial and Organizational Assessment. Each volume has an introductory chapter by the editor. In the case of Volume 2, there is an introductory chapter for objective tests and an introductory chapter for projective tests. In general, introductory chapters are concerned with a historical review, range of tests, theoretical considerations, psychometric concerns, range of populations for which the tests are appropriate, cross-cultural factors, accommodation for persons with disabilities, legal and ethical issues, computerization, and future perspectives. Chapters on individual tests or approaches cover many of the same areas but in much more specific detail, in addition, of course, to the test description and development. Other chapters are more conceptual and theoretical in nature and articulate an approach to evaluation, such as the chapters on clinical interviewing and program evaluation in Volume 3. In developing the CHOPA concept and selecting chapters and contributors, our objective has been to be comprehensive in a global sense but not encyclopedic (i.e., detailing every conceivable and extant assessment strategy or test). However, we believe that we are sufficiently comprehensive so that the interested reader can move to greater specificity, if needed, on the basis of the very current list of references for each chapter.

The paper considers the following issues: reasons for community college attendance among disabled students; differences in demographics and motivations among students with and without disabilities; and differences in these motivations by type of disability. A random sample of students, both with and without disabilities, was selected. The Educational Participation Scale (EPS) instrument was mailed to students, and a total of 198 responses were collected. The results of the study indicated that among students with disabilities, a higher proportion of them were female, older, and less likely to have children and work full-time, as compared with their non-disabled peers. In addition to demographic discrepancies between the two groups, students with disabilities also scored higher on four of the EPS factors: social contact, educational preparation, social stimulation, and cognitive interest, indicating that these students enrolled in community colleges for social and academic reasons. The opportunity to meet new people and explore intellectual curiosities encourages them to participate. (Contains 52 references and two appendices, including the EPS instrument.)

1761,Divided shopping: A syntactic approach to consumer behaviour,"Shopping is a socially interactive consumer activity that involves preference, selection and leisure. As historical city centres are still cores of traditional shopping and an asset improving social attraction, attractive routes and spaces for pedestrian movement provided by articulation in the setting are worth examining. Buildings on small sized plots located in a bounded environment usually encourage pedestrian flow, presenting more options of interest on a unit street scale; whereas spatial layout of the urban form, compactness of the circulation routes or visual scope of the users should also be examined. This paper focuses on the comparison of consumer shopping behaviour in such a historical city centre, Walled City of Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus Republic and TRNC. Regarding the lost centrality due to the UN buffer zone, divided city has gone through different physical and social development patterns in terms of land uses and functional changes.

On the other hand, as an aspect of political curiosity both sides of the buffer zone also serve as attraction nodes regardless of the functions. <c2><a9> 2015, A|Z ITU Journal of Faculty of Architectur.

This paper presents the voices of three practitioners experienced in, and passionate about the field of culturally diverse music education. Over the past 25 years the presenters have ignited an interest in world musics in their students from pre-school to higher education in North America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East. They have been committed to creating innovative programs which practically reflect the changing nature of contemporary classrooms within a global society. The paper provides a review of the current state of culturally diverse music education in North America and Australia--exploring underlying philosophical constructs, prevailing attitudes and current teacher training experiences--as a theoretical framework for a practical ""how to"" guide for school teachers; tried and tested with a wide variety of ages, and in an abundance of contexts. Themes discussed include the role of diverse musical experiences in creative expression, and the critical role individual music educators play in assisting students to develop qualities of curiosity, open-mindedness and a ""tolerance of uncertainty"". Factors conducive to successful multicultural music programs and a contextual themes framework will provide readers with knowledge and skills to spark interest in world musics in their students.","Cain, Melissa and Lindblom, Shari and Walden, Jennifer",0,,1268
1763,Fire Bee versus ABC: Cultural varieties in mother-child play interactions in a playgroup and at home,"The purpose of this study is to understand how mothers and children interact with each other during play in the playgroup and at home. Since context makes interactional features of play meaningful, the playgroup was the main focus and attention was also given to how mothers interact with each other and with other children. How interactions in the playgroup create context is important to understand mother-child play as is looking at mother-child play at home to understand interactional patterns in greater depth. The connection between the play interactions and mothers' beliefs about child development and play is an additional focus. The findings showed that the playgroup culture (e.g., rules and rituals) was on American cultural values. Mothers from other countries adjusted their behaviors but they also continued to behave according to their home cultural values. In the playgroup, mothers formed small groups based on their racial/cultural backgrounds and they interacted with the mothers who had similar backgrounds. This segregation led to lesser degrees of communication and interaction among the mothers, which in turn' limited children's interactions. When the mothers played with other children, they tended to limit their interactions, for instance by giving short answers to the children's questions or by giving directives or instructions when children requested their help. When their own children attempted to involve themselves into others' play, the mothers tried to channel their children's attention to something else. The data from the observations and interviews indicated that lack of communication and interaction limited mothers' abilities to create their own playgroup culture in which they could feel comfortable in reacting and responding to others' behaviors. The playgroup and home observations revealed that mothers played with their children using different strategies (e.g., demonstration, direct teaching). Children seemed to respond best when their mothers showed consistency in their strategies. Children also looked for variety in mothers' responses. When mothers used too much instruction, children became less responsive in play. Children became more responsive when they felt confident in completing tasks or in answering their mothers' questions. Both mothers and children seemed to read and interpret each other's signals to change the theme of the play or to continue the play. The data from the home observations and interviews showed that the relationship among beliefs was complex and that the relationship between mothers' beliefs and behaviors was not clear-cut. For instance, all four mothers stated that all types of play and play materials were valuable and they did not have any preference for more educational play or toys even as they acknowledged the importance of play as a vehicle to learn new things. Also, the mothers mentioned the importance of improving creativity, curiosity, individuality, and independence in children but tended to use direct teaching strategies. They imposed their agendas during dyadic play instead of following the children's initiatives and interests as they played together. (Abstract shortened by UMI.).","Gol-Guven, Mine",0,,1269
1764,"Investigating scientific curiosity in young learners: A multiple case study of a five-year-old, a six-year-old, and a seven-year-old","The purpose of this qualitative, multiple case study research was to understand scientific curiosity in young learners (children between the ages of five and seven years) which is a population often neglected in qualitative curiosity research. Situated learning theory provided the theoretical framework since curiosity is viewed as an independent and personal endeavor in which knowledge is constructed on an individual level. This study focused on three research questions: (1) what are young learners curious about that may possibly influence future science learning and education, (2) when a natural phenomenon captivates a young learner's scientific curiosity, what actions follow, and (3) what are characteristics of experiences young learners bring with them from outside of their schooling that may influence scientific curiosity. Three young children and their parents participated in the study for a maximum of ten interactions. Data collection methods included initial semi-structured interviews of both the children and the parents, field notes, observations, and photographs taken by the researcher, adult participant, and/or child participant. The findings showed that several observable behaviors of curiosity in previous studies with younger and older participants were also apparent in this study's participants: exploration/discovery, questioning, and sustained interest. In addition to the anticipated findings, several unforeseen findings appeared during the data analysis process. These unforeseen factors affecting curiosity included technology, interruptions and diversions, curiosity of other family members, and fear of natural phenomenon. The findings have implications for early childhood and elementary teaching practices, learning environments, and designing lessons in elementary classrooms.

1765,Curiosity-Bottleneck: Exploration by distilling task-specific novelty,"Exploration based on state novelty has brought great success in challenging reinforcement learning problems with sparse rewards. However, existing novelty-based strategies become inefficient in real-world problems where observation contains not only task-dependent state novelty of our interest but also task-irrelevant information that should be ignored. We introduce an information-theoretic exploration strategy named Curiosity-Bottleneck that distills task-relevant information from observation. Based on the information bottleneck principle, our exploration bonus is quantified as the compressiveness of observation with respect to the learned representation of a compressive value network. With extensive experiments on static image classification, grid-world and three hard-exploration Atari games, we show that Curiosity-Bottleneck learns an effective exploration strategy by robustly measuring the state novelty in distractive environments where state-of-the-art exploration methods often degenerate.

1767,Development of a museum exhibition system combining interactional and transmissional learning,"""Hands-on"" exhibitions, which not only present objects for viewing but also stimulate learning by allowing visitors actually able to touch them, is gaining increasing popularity at museums. By actually handling an exhibited object, the visitor can get a better understanding of the characteristics of the object that cannot be fully grasped by just looking it, such as the object's underlying structure and hidden aspects, as well as tactile information like the object's weight, hardness, and so on. The experience also arouses curiosity and interest and becomes a learning opportunity for the viewer. The author has developed an interactive exhibition system for museums, which combines learning based on the interaction with physical objects and knowledge transmission. In this system, the user handles and looks at an actual physical object, which appears just like the original object and talks directly to the user. This ""conversation"" with the object as the user ""grasps"" (in both senses) the object deepens the user's understanding of and interest in the object. This ""narrative"" feedback to the user is achieved through the active linkage between, in the case presented here, a fossil in real space and three-dimensional computer graphics employing Augmented Reality (AR). The system uses RF-ID technology to determine the level of the user's ""grasping"" state and to feed back information to the user. In this chapter, the author presents the actual implementation of this interactive system at a museum and a school. The system was tested with elementary and junior high school students and I present results of the trials that show the convenience of the system and its beneficial effect on learning. <c2><a9> 2010, IGI Global.","Hisamatsu, S",0,10.4018/978-1-60566-703-4.ch020,1272
1770,Brain-Inspired Emergence of Behaviors Based on the Desire for Existence by Reinforcement Learning,"To develop truly autonomous mobile robots, we proposed to introduce internal rewards such as the desire for existence, specific curiosity, diversive Curiosity, boredom, and novelty into reinforcement learning. They are expected to make mobile robots capable of behaving appropriately without being told what to do. Firstly, we proposed to use multiple Sources of rewards to endow mobile robots with ability to behave properly in the real world. Secondly, we proposed task-independent internal rewards. Thirdly, we proposed to attain engineering merit of internal rewards in addition to scientific interest. A pursuit-evasion game comprising a predator and its prey on a robotic field was selected as a testbed to demonstrate the effectiveness of internal rewards in reinforcement learning. The present paper focuses on learning of pursuit timing to maximize accumulated future rewards by Q-learning and SARSA.","Morita, Mikio and Ishikawa, Masumi",0,,1273

1774,How Parents Can Nurture a Lifelong Love of the Arts,"How can parents more clearly understand what's behind shifts in motivation so that they may preserve their gifted children's joy and kindle a lifelong love of the arts? A shift takes place when intrinsic motivation gives way to extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is desire kindled within. One who is intrinsically motivated is deeply engaged and enjoys the process. Extrinsic motivation is behavior controlled by outside factors, such as a promise of rewards or a fear of punishment. Harvard Business School professor Theresa Amabile has led several decades of research which demonstrates that creativity flourishes under the influence of intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivators include interest, enjoyment, satisfaction, and challenge of the work itself. There is interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and Amabile has documented this as well. The bottom line for parents is that the task at hand, and the work more generally, must be meaningful to the child in order to sustain intrinsic motivation over time. Parents can help keep curiosity alive by: (1) Sharing what they love; (2) Providing opportunities for their children to explore within the context of the arts; (3) Looking for classes that value process over product; and (4) Allowing children to pursue new types of activities.","Haydon, Kathryn P",0,,1275
1777,TALENTED BIOCHEMISTRY STUDENTS,"Close to 15% of Primary and Secondary school students are considered `talented students'. This observation can be made in several areas like music, mathemathics, languages, biology, arts, chemistry and physics to mention a few. A talented biochemistry student combines a high level of curiosity and interest in biochemistry, creativity and devotion to ``bio'' sciences. For the benefit of talented students and the entire society, the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department (Universitat de Barcelona) has continuously been trying to find gifted biochemistry students to help develop their talents. Many years ago, the Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department started several initiatives ``I love Biochemistry'' and ``Teacher refresher biochemistry course'' to provide opportunities for talented biochemistry students and their science teachers. The following three key factors are important for the creation of the right atmosphere which allows us to offer these experimenting programs and ensure their success: 1) University and community support 2) The use of university facilities to enhance cost control 3) The selection of students The main aim of this work is to present and analyse the model of Biochemistry Talent Development outside the secondary school classroom, and discuss future perspectives.","Fernandez Novell, Josep M and Zaragoza Domenech, Carme",0,,1276

The article builds on that work and examines the hypothesis that almost twenty years after the first wave of such studies, the focus on neuroimaging and its application to complex and profoundly personal human behaviors has not abated. Neuroimaging studies remain an unwavering source of energy for the field. It reviews some of the reasons that they have provoked so much attention in neuroethics and elsewhere, presenting a 2002-2008 update to the trends that documented for 1991-2001, comparing this second generation of data to the first. <c2><a9> Oxford University Press 2011.

1785,Review of A brief introduction to psychoanalytic theory,"Reviews the book, A brief introduction to psychoanalytic theory by Stephen Frosh, Basingstoke(see record 2012-18994-000). Frosh plunges in with a good, strong beginning which sets the tone of this book as one that explores some of the major theoretical ideas of psychoanalysis. There is a momentum about this first part of the book whose pace and structure engages readers curiosity. It is quite a page turner. Author's clarity and discipline in choosing which elements need further explication and which areas to leave to the briefest of mentions is well judged. This allows the reader to enter at times quite deeply into complex psychoanalytic ideas without becoming lost and overwhelmed. The chapters which introduce Freud and his major theories are particularly enjoyable. This excellent book is essential reading for teachers, trainers, supervisors and trainees in the psychoanalytic and psychodynamic field and is recommended reading for those with an informed interest in the subject. It is not a book for the complete beginner. Practitioners too will find much in here to interest them, but this is not a clinical book. Neither does it set out to be. With this book, author has managed to combine brevity and depth. As all brief introductions should do, he whets the appetite rather than satisfies it and provides generous and comprehensive references for those many readers who will be inspired to read on.

1787,Sexual disorders,"Disordered sexual behavior has been of interest to philosophers, theologians, psychiatrists, psychologists, and other healthcare providers throughout the ages. Sexual deviance has been conceptualized by many in society as illness, immoral behavior, and ""unnatural."" Non-normative sexual behavior/gender expression has also at times been criminalized/pathologized and then decriminalized/depathologized, depending on the politics and ethos of the current society. The amount of curiosity and historical constraints societies and religions have placed on private sexual acts begs the question, ""Why are we as a species concerned about people's private sexual activity?"". As Adlerians, the above question can be answered in many ways. Individual Psychology is concerned with the underlying meaning of a specific sexual behavior not only for the individual client, but also the meaning this behavior has for others and the larger community. Throughout this chapter, we will be exploring Adlerian concepts such as social interest, social equality, inferiority/superiority, organ jargon, masculine protest, and life-style construction (including gender guiding lines) as it relates to the DSM-5 diagnosis of sexual psychopathology. Clinical case presentations, DSM-5 criteria, Adlerian case conceptualization, and treatment recommendations are included. In the DSM-5, sexual disorders have been broken into three categories, including Sexual Dysfunctions, Gender Dysphoria, and Paraphilic Disorders. These categories each have their own chapter in Section II of the DSM-5. It should be noted that in the DSM-IV-TR all three of the above categories were placed under one heading, ""Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders"".

1788,Discussion of psychoanalysis based on my insight and experience as a patient,"The author replies to some of the arguments raised by Bumke in the previous number of this journal. She claims it is unreasonable in view of Freud's later work and contributions to accept Maylan's interpretation of his life as a neurotic revolt against his father, the Pope and Rome. While it may have been a factor at first he later came to a fully integrated grasp of his life. Contrary to Bumke's charge, Freud does not oppose religion for all, but expressly recognizes its advantages for those of a particular mentality. For the neurotic it may be an obstacle to his grasp of reality. The object of the analyst is not, as Bumke claims, to produce a cure simply by analysis, but to cultivate a new point of view and understanding in the patient so that he may cure himself. Only the bad analyst dogmatizes. A brief account is given of the cause and development of a neurosis in childhood, and an explanation of the sort of body-interest and curiosity the child has along with his need for tenderness, called childish sexuality and often misinterpreted. Opposition of the patient is a common and understandable stage through which he must pass toward cure, consisting in the loss of the feeling of isolation and a calm understanding of himself.

1790,Motivation,"We discuss the three adult relational motivations of identity, attachment, and attraction important in emotion-focused couples therapy and illuminate how they function by means of affect and its regulation. The development of a more differentiated affect regulation process theory of adult intimate relationships, and how it works, helps provide a more differentiated base for interventions with couples. A more differentiated theory of attachment and identity should be based on an understanding of the function of different emotions and their regulation in the attachment and identity process at different times, rather than global concepts such as security, self-esteem, different attachment styles, or types of selves. We need to focus on, and intervene with, the emotions that result from ruptures to secure attachment and deflation of self-esteem. The process of distress in attachment ruptures involves a sequence of angry protest, anxious clinging, depression, sadness, hopelessness, despair, and finally, alienated detachment; it is these emotions we need to focus on in intervention. This is one of the scripts, and often the most fundamental script, in marital distress. It, however, also differs from scripts of affection, involving pleasure, compassion, love, and warmth, and from scripts related to identity and agency, which involve emotions of interest, curiosity, pride, and anger; and yet again from scripts of threats to dominance, which involve shame, rage, and guilt. We need to attend to all these emotions in couples therapy.

1793,Promoting the production of non-timber forest products,"Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) have long been collected for food, medicine, income, and pleasure, traditionally in rural areas. NTFPs include edible products (mushrooms, nuts, berries, etc), specialty wood products (hand carvings, walking canes, etc.), floral and decorative products (moss, vines, etc.), and medicinal products (ginseng, goldenseal, black cohosh, etc.) and reported sales contribute over $30 million each year to the West Virginia economy. West Virginia landowners possess some of the most biologically diverse forest in the United States. Many plants and other products can be derived from these forests for social and economic value. In order to educate, arouse curiosity, and stimulate interest, a variety of outreach methods were employed to best inform landowners about NTFPs One method was to construct six demonstration areas (one in each of the former six Division of Forestry districts) showcasing the most commonly harvested medicinal plants. An 'inoculate-your-own'shiitake mushroom workshop was also conducted at each of the sites. The second method used was to compose a booklet of ten case studies that highlighted the challenges/successes, production methods, organizational structure, and marketing methods used by landowners who started and succeeded with their own forestbased business. Finally, in an attempt to gain knowledge about the existing harvesting and interest levels among landowners, a survey was conducted that targeted four counties, two from the traditional blue-collared western region and two from the rapidly urbanizing counties in the eastern panhandle. General demographic information (age, gender, income, education, and occupation) was also collected. In addition, a landowner's willingness to pay and travel to a two-hour workshop was collected to determine future interest and workshop locations regarding NTFPs. The survey yielded a 32% response rate (531 valid responses; 1649 surveys mailed). Landowners who are from the western region (rural) were 2.7 times (p=0.0105, chi 6.55) more likely to harvest medicinal herbs than 'urban' landowners. The size of the respondent landholdings (in acres) was a significant variable in the medicinal herb, edible, and specialty wood product categories, while age was significant in all four categories. The survey also indicated that landowners who own forested land are also more willing to pay and travel to a two hour workshop than those who do not own forested land.","Riley, Adam C",0,,1286

1795,Similar recent selection criteria associated with different behavioural effects in two dog breeds,"Selection during the last decades has split some established dog breeds into morphologically and behaviourally divergent types. These breed splits are interesting models for behaviour genetics since selection has often been for few and well-defined behavioural traits. The aim of this study was to explore behavioural differences between selection lines in golden and Labrador retriever, in both of which a split between a common type (pet and conformation) and a field type (hunting) has occurred. We hypothesized that the behavioural profiles of the typeswould be similar in both breeds. Pedigree data and results from a standardized behavioural test from 902 goldens (698 common and 204 field) and 1672 Labradors (1023 and 649) were analysed. Principal component analysis revealed six behavioural components: curiosity, play interest, chase proneness, social curiosity, social greeting and threat display. Breed and type affected all components, but interestingly there was an interaction between breed and type for most components. For example, in Labradors the common type had higher curiosity than the field type (F-1,F-1668 = 18.359; P < 0.001), while the opposite was found in goldens (F-1,F-897 = 65.201; P < 0.001). Heritability estimates showed considerable genetic contributions to the behavioural variations in both breeds, but different heritabilities between the types within breeds was also found, suggesting different selection pressures. In conclusion, in spite of similar genetic origin and similar recent selection criteria, types behave differently in the breeds. This suggests that the genetic architecture related to behaviour differs between the breeds.","Sundman, A-S. and Johnsson, M and Wright, D and Jensen, P",0,10.1111/gbb.12317,1288
1796,Situational interest and learning: Thirst for knowledge,"The objective of the three studies presented here was to investigate how situational interest is related to knowledge acquisition. Situational interest is construed as a motivational response to a perceived knowledge deficit. It is triggered in situations where this knowledge deficit becomes manifest, such as in the confrontation with a problem. In Study 1 we manipulated prior knowledge of 32 secondary-school students about a particular problem (i.e., reasons for the conquest of Singapore by the Japanese during the Second World War). Only students who lacked the appropriate knowledge showed an increase in situational interest after the problem was presented. In Study 2 (N = 60), students who showed awareness that they lacked knowledge to understand a problem (i.e., causes of erosion of an island) showed increased situational interest in that problem. In Study 3 (N = 86), situational interest and knowledge acquisition were monitored over the course of a 3-h lesson in a natural classroom. We were able to demonstrate that situational interest decreased with increasing knowledge of the problem-at-hand. We argue that the findings support a knowledge-deprivation account of situational interest. Our findings are at variance with the broadly held conviction that situational interest and knowledge necessarily influence each other positively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

1799,"Labyrinths: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow-Implications for Education","Educators are continuously looking at innovative ways to teaching and working with students of all ages. The tools used range from the simplest technologies, such as chalk and pencils, to the high-tech tools involving computers and information systems. The best tools and strategies often invoke the use of the old and new or the old in a new way. In 2002 an interest in labyrinths (the old) led most naturally to an Internet search (the new) and resulted in the obvious question of how these mysterious, yet marvelous, patterns could be applied to the instructional arena. An extensive search of the traditional literature databases and the Internet at that time revealed only passing comments and anecdotal records and there were few of those. The existing literature did reveal that these mystifying geometric forms have a long history. Curiosity was piqued and enthusiasm ignited as questions centering on how these may relate to children in an educational setting came to the surface. Courses such as ""Classroom Management"" that, of course, include student behavior, became a consideration. What if a simple geometric tool, such as the labyrinth, could positively affect student behavior and the overall climate in the classroom? Schools create a community in which effective teaching and learning occur. Teachers should care about students' personal, emotional, and spiritual well being besides delivering knowledge. It is important that students are exposed to learning in a climate that nurtures their development in all ways. Could labyrinths help students look inside their minds and explore their potential? The students themselves have some of the answers. As one said, ""It gave me a chance to reflect on the things I've done, said and felt."" (LECT, 2003) This article will look at the historical background of the labyrinth as well as definitions. Then a modern view will be given with details on the various ways it is being used today including an overview of a school study.

1800,The murky distinction between curiosity and interest: State of the art and future prospects,"AbstractCuriosity and interest are at the core of human inquiry. However, controversies remain about how best to conceptualize these constructs. I propose to derive definitions by attending to the common core of typical usages of the two terms. Using this approach, curiosity can be defined as a psychological state that includes three components: recognition of an information gap, anticipation that it may be possible to close it, and an intrinsically motivated desire to do so. Interest can be more broadly defined as intrinsically motivated engagement with any specific object, content, or activity. The two definitions imply that curiosity is a special case of interest. Furthermore, I propose to use the state-trait distinction to distinguish between momentary and enduring forms of both curiosity and interest, which makes it possible to treat state versus trait curiosity and interest in conceptually parallel ways. To make further progress in understanding the two constructs, research is needed that investigates their affective dynamics and their generalizability across age-related and socio-cultural contexts.

1801,ELDERLY ANSWER ABOUT CONCEPTS OF AGING AND COMPUTER USE: EDUCATIONAL,"The article was a collaborative group text, of researchers at PUCRS who deals with elderly, based on discussions about the themes and results of investigations about elderly concepts and utilization computers. Supported on the existing Gerontological, Educational Psychology, specially Positive Psychology, and Information and Communication Technology-ICT literature, and having the conscious of the multidimensionality of aging, adult learning processes and consequent adjusted teaching processes, in an Educational Psychology perspective, we intent to know better about real contexts. Educational activities designed for early childhood education are created to meet the needs of this age group, but the same practices are not necessarily adequate to be applied in adult education for elderly. In our qualitative investigations, the results appears better by triangulation between speech, writing and image, used in the methodological triangulation of data. We developed different digital inclusion courses, about their responses on use of computer and Internet, but at the same time know about their concepts and fears in use them, and also their concepts of aging. Our researches points to make the classes more interesting, put emphasis on affective interpersonal relationships, attend more closely, increase aspects of self-esteem. In these investigations, seniors often stereotyped perform comparisons between generations in order to belittle their own learning potential when they compares themselves to younger people. But when they start to act as students in the search for new knowledge and act, the vision of some inferiority is left out, giving way to new perspectives. Initially, their concepts of what is for them aging were, in most cases, simplified and, at the same time, linked in some way only to the biological dimension. After the digital inclusion workshops, especially using the Internet, they tell that had significant changes towards more complex vision of the phenomenon. Gradually, the view of exclusivity knowledge meant only for younger people has been changed, opening prospects for the meaning that age is no impediment to the formation of new knowledge or actions. The Internet did give its greatest impact in relation to the interest, concentration and intellectual curiosity, they did not manifest the same interest when the material used were book or printed articles. After our readings and discussions we can conclude that our courses using ICT have positive impact on the expression of personal feelings and actions, leading them to develop sense of competence and intense mobilization to overcome challenges.","Stobaeus, Claus Dieter and Ferreira, Anderson Jackle and Marques, Caroline Prato and Tacques Wehemeyer, Claudia de Oliveira and Goulart, Denise and Mourino Mosquera, Juan Jose",0,,1293
1804,The Light Fantastic: Making Learning Visible for All Children through the Project Approach,"Curiosity, wonder, creativity, questions, initiation by the child, and framing by the teacher--all these characterize the project approach. Projects can be an invaluable part of any curriculum, providing opportunities for children to study subjects they find interesting in detail. Project work is not a method one uses after the ""real"" teaching has occurred; instead, it is a foundational approach enabling children to be self-motivated learners equipped with the skills to do in-depth investigations of topics worth learning. The investigation is usually undertaken by a small group of children within a class, sometimes by a whole class, and occasionally by an individual child. The key element of a project is that it is a research effort deliberately focused on finding answers to questions about a topic posed either by the children, the teacher, or the teacher working with the children. This article illustrates how projects can be a welcoming and enriching addition to an emerging curriculum for children with special needs.

1806,The in-depth science of the tic-tac-toe game,"In the present chapter a robotic application bringing together games, informatics, robotics, artificial intelligence, and artificial vision is described. The development of a game player, thus performing an ""intelligent"" activity is presented. The authors thus suggest that, more than simulation only, the development of the system could offer a serious way of developing learning and interest on the underlying sciences. The system, which only uses off the shelf components, allows for the ""intelligent"" behavior to be shown through the use of a simple robotic system. In particular, advanced intelligent sensors are used, and the capacities are derived from the tasks of industrial automatic visual inspection, for which the system is designed. These are applied to the recognition of hand-written symbols for accomplishment of a playful activity. The result is a demonstrator, which has proved to be good at catching attention, curiosity, and publicity.

In response to their curiosity, the clone factory activity was developed to help them understand the process of cloning. In this activity, students reenact the cloning process, in a very simplified simulation. After completing the process, they will discover what species they have cloned. Students will then research the risks and benefits of cloning, which they summarize in a short report.","Stoddard, Beryl",0,,1297
1808,Toward a neuroscience of information sampling and curiosity,"Rather than building faithful and complete representations of the complex environments we inhabit, humans, like other animals, act on sparse summaries that include only a selected portion of the available cues. Sparse sampling is evident in everyday behaviors such as active sensing and attentional selection, but its core mechanisms are very poorly understood. How does the brain decide which one of the many available cues to sample? I review emerging evidence regarding this question from neuro-scientific studies of information seeking and curiosity, with an emphasis on three themes. First, I show that these studies prompt us to abandon the traditional views of perception as a mere input to decision mechanisms, and appreciate the importance of attentional decisions regarding the sensory dimensions that should be prioritized in a situation. Second, I propose that sampling decisions must work efficiently not only in familiar situations in which the sampling policy is learned in advance (such as driving or preparing a tea) but also in highly novel and ambiguous settings where the agent must discover new regularities, tasks and goals. Finally, I propose that in the latter contexts, the brain motivates sampling based on the properties of the belief states that the information is expected to bring-such as affective responses, uncertainty, learning-progress and cognitive effort associated with an attentional episode. This provides a family of intrinsic (epistemic) motivations, which generate behaviors we label as ""curiosity"" and ""creativity"" and allow us to continuously (if slowly and imperfectly) extend our knowledge and discover new patterns and regularities. I review the emerging neuroscientific results supporting these views and their implications of these findings for core topics of interest in neuroscience research, including attention, learning and decision making, and for the relatively new topics of curiosity and creativity.

We target to investigate learning affordances, contextual conditions (e.g., community-building mechanisms, infrastructural settings), dos and don'ts around the development of such ground-up initiative in Singapore. Our assumption is that such design of learning environments and/or pedagogies could be avenue to promote and optimise ""interest"", ""creation"" and/or ""habit"" in learning.","Wu, L and He, S",0,,1299
1810,Curious learners: How infants' motivation to learn shapes and is shaped by infants' interactions with the social world,"Most theories of infant social learning focus on how infants learn whatever and whenever the adults decide to teach them. While infants are well equipped to learn from adults, recent research suggests infant social learning is not a passive process but that infants may play an active role in acquiring information and modulating their learning according to their interests. This chapter aims to highlight the importance of investigating young children's intrinsic motivation for learning, particularly in the domain of social learning. It reviews the current research on how infants' curiosity may be expressed through their behaviour while interacting with social partners, and how responding to these expressions of curiosity may affect infants' learning. Finally, through the investigation of the possible neurological underpinnings of the social and motivational aspects of learning, this chapter explores infants' selectivity in social partners and how it can be explained by their motivation to learn. <c2><a9> Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Begus, K and Southgate, V",0,10.1007/978-3-319-77182-3_2,1300

One result following from such a theory has been the stress on adjusting to and adopting appropriate social roles as if proper addition of social roles would produce personal identity. Theories of growth, however, present ""Human beings as... curious, inquiring, sympathetic."" These theories hold that, ""curiosity, interest, thought, sympathy, trust, love are primary human attributes, not simple secondary, derived, or detour processes or sex-inhibited aims.""

1815,Challenging or creative? Impatient or curious? Disposition discourse in the early years,"Two-year olds are inherently curious about the world around them and in the absence of prior knowledge are creative in the ways they respond to new experiences. Dispositions such as creativity and curiosity can influence motivations for learning and development which in our rapidly changing society are invaluable for lifelong learning and workplace success. Although the subject of learning dispositions has gained research interest more recently, the significance of curiosity and creativity as key dispositions to very early learning and development has not been explored in relation to practice for this age range, despite the rapid growth and development taking place at this time and the obvious value of embedding positive early learning habits. It is here that this research makes a unique contribution. An interpretivist approach was taken for this research in order to generate an in-depth insider perspective. Semi-structured interviews were used to gain an insight into early years practitioner knowledge and understanding of curiosity and creativity as dispositions, to explore the ways in which they support the learning and development of two-year olds and to investigate their perspectives on the role and function of early childhood education and care. Thematic analysis was used to identify discourses that influence and frame the focus of early years practice. Initial analysis indicated a lack of awareness of dispositions and revealed strong themes around preparing young children for school in terms of academic skills and positive behaviours. To investigate influences on practice further, practitioner observations of children were analysed, and this documentary analysis was extended to include the Statutory and non-statutory practitioner guidance which both frames and influences early years practice in England. This research revealed discourses with a focus on becoming which reflects the ways that children's learning and development is currently portrayed within the early years. Behaviours associated with dispositions such as curiosity and creativity tend to be discouraged and inhibited resulting in these necessary dispositions for lifelong learning being weakened rather than strengthened. This practice reflects the values and beliefs which frame the wider outcomes orientated education system in England. Through extending the discourses available to practitioners we can support them to develop agency through reflective practice which would in turn offer possibilities for children's learning and development to be interpreted in more diverse ways. This would enable practitioners to adjust the focus of their practice to support the valuable process of learning and to promote dispositions which will ultimately enable children to reach their potential and become lifelong learners. This research offers a unique contribution to knowledge in the exploration of disposition discourse and practice and focuses on the little examined field of dispositions in relation to very young children and the practitioners who work with them. Models of practice have been developed to identify the ways in which practice may be enhanced providing a useful framework to support practitioners to reflect on practice.

1816,The Great Mathematician Project,"The Great Mathematician Project (GMP) introduces both mathematically sophisticated and struggling students to the history of mathematics. The rationale for the GMP is twofold: first, mathematics is a uniquely people-centered discipline that is used to make sense of the world; and second, students often express curiosity about the history of mathematics and are curious about careers in mathematics-related fields, such as engineering and technology. As middle school students explore how individuals from historically underrepresented groups have made substantive contributions to mathematics and science, their views expand. They learn how sexism and racism have challenged famous mathematicians and scientists alike. With this knowledge, students develop empathy and an appreciation for the processes of collaboration and innovation that characterize the work of mathematicians and scientists. The article directs the student to the seven stages of the GMP and how it helped famous mathematicians and scientists alike learn to face and deal with the challenges of sexism and racism in their field of study. As students embrace the Great Mathematician Project it boosts their research skills and confidence in public speaking while also increasing their understanding of how mathematics is used in the real world.","Goldberg, Sabrina R",0,,1304
1817,Interestingness,"Conducted 3 experiments to examine the roles of background knowledge and likelihood in interest. In Exps 1 and 2, with a total of 95 college students, merely increasing the amount of background knowledge on a topic did not always increase the interest for statements on that topic. However, background knowledge that combined with a statement to create an interesting implicit proposition did increase interest. In Exp 3, with 10 adults, the likelihood of an event's occurrence was not a good predictor of its interestingness, whereas there was a good correspondence between interest and changes in the Ss' beliefs. Findings suggest that interest is not a simple function of either unexpectedness or amount of background knowledge. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that statements changing a person's beliefs or confidence in beliefs are interesting.

1820,A comprehensive stream study designed for an undergraduate non-majors course in earth science,"Science courses for students not majoring in science present unique teaching challenges to educators. Often non-science majors need help seeing the relevance of the course material and making connections between science and their own lives. One promising way to motivate these students and increase their level of interest and understanding is to teach in an integrated lab/lecture format using inquiry-based methods. Such activities maintain a constant level of attention from the students by requiring them to collect their own data, analyze the data set, interpret their data, and prepare a class presentation of their findings. We are experimenting with a new set of science courses that are designed to be interdepartmentally staffed, to integrate aspects of mathematics, geology, chemistry, and biology in an environmental theme, and to use guided-inquiry methods in a lab/lecture format. The interdisciplinary faculty team provides students with a diverse set of backgrounds and skills, and the interaction between instructors allows the students to observe the connection among the different sciences. The laboratory described below is a typical exercise drawn from our curriculum. We have modified a classic exercise in stream hydrology by integrating each of the scientific disciplines listed above in order to illustrate the advantages of interdisciplinary, guided-inquiry teaching methods. We find that an interactive approach greatly improves the student's critical-thinking skills and stimulates scientific curiosity as compared to traditional lecture methods. While our new curriculum is facilitated by external funding and the commitment of our administration and science faculty, we believe that the exercise presented here is very flexible and can be undertaken by earth-science faculty in a variety of educational contexts.","Dunnivant, F M and Newman, M E and Brzenk, R and Moore, A and Alfano, M J",0,10.5408/1089-9995-47.2.158,1306

Substantially driven by curiosity about reality television celebrity Donald Trump, the initial debates hosted by FOX News and CNN both reflected and validated interest in his candidacy while proffering attention to a full slate of more traditional presidential contenders in front of boisterous audiences. This study considers these audiences' response. Whether applause, laughter, booing, or combinations thereof, these group utterances provide a reliable metric by which insights may be derived concerning partisan attitudes towards Trump and the other candidates, as well as the unity of the Republican Party.

1826,How do college and university undergraduate level global citizenship programs advance the development and experiences of global competencies?,"Colleges and universities across the nation have, within the last 20 years, mobilized to prepare their students to become globally aware, socially responsible, and engaged citizens of the world. Although the imperative for these colleges and universities is to provide students with the intellectual tools to function as global citizens, there is no scholarly consensus on the definition of the term ""global citizenship,"" no agreement on the implementation of such a curriculum, and hence, no programmatic assessment model. As such, the scholarly discussions surrounding the topic of global citizenship programs have led to an increased curiosity about and interest in the development and experiences of global competencies. This study applies Hunter's (2004) concept of global competence as a measure of global citizenship, and evaluates a representative group of 25 colleges and universities offering undergraduate level global citizenship programs on a range of specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes. The focus of the study is to answer two major research questions: what are the guiding principles of undergraduate level global citizenship programs, and, how are they advancing the development of global competencies? This study employs a mixed methodological approach, consisting of a quantitative Likert-scale survey and in-depth interviews, to better understand global citizenship concepts, the manner in which programs are organized, thoughts about what is happening with global citizenship education, and faculty and administrator experiences. The findings of this research, although exhibiting overlap with Hunter's (2004) findings, reveal that global competencies are not synonymous with global citizenship. By employing Hunter's (2004) checklist, which provides a focused starting point for assessing global citizenship programs, this research study reveals the various programmatic components, themes and guiding principles that are beneficial to the development of global citizenship, but which are not the same as those required for global competency.

This process is illustrated in the following clinical moment - one in which the patient experiences the analyst as having painfully missed the point, leading the analyst, in turn, to feel misunderstood as if words were being put in her mouth. In the meantime, the patient himself felt that the analyst had misunderstood him. This clinical moment takes place midway through the second year of an analysis of a 45-year-old academic. Early in his analysis, the patient<e2><80><99>s limited capacity for self-reflection, his reliance on intellectualization, his disdain for the analyst<e2><80><99>s efforts to empathize, his dedication to the stance of reject-or-be-rejected, and his habit of dismissing clinical efforts to connect him with his feelings were experienced by the analyst as off-putting and frustrating. This clinical moment followed a new and notable period in which the patient<e2><80><99>s attitude appeared to soften and the beginnings of a therapeutic collaboration were emerging. The patient reluctantly told the analyst that he<e2><80><99>d been awarded a prestigious grant.

In Study 1 (Italians, N = 151), I-type EC correlated positively with positive outcome-expectancies and risk-taking, but negatively with thinking about negative outcomes. D-type EC correlated positively with emotional restraint, thoughtful evaluation, and concern over negative outcomes and potential risks. In Study 2 (Americans, N = 218; Germans, N = 56), I-type EC correlated positively with behavioral activation, especially fun seeking, whereas D-type correlated negatively with fun seeking. Neither EC scale correlated significantly with behavioral inhibition. These findings suggest that I-type EC corresponds to fun, carefree and optimistic approaches to learning, while D-type EC reflects greater thoughtfulness and caution regarding knowledge-search.

1832,Planning and exploratory buying behavior,"Exploratory behavior has a long tradition in the psychology literature. The concept of the optimum stimulation level (OLS) was simultaneously introduced by two psychologist researchers: Donald Olding Hebb (1955) and Clarence Leuba (1955). OLS assumes that each individual has a certain need for stimulation. The optimum level is the stimulation level that is preferred and adjusted through increasing and decreasing the stimulation level, respectively, in order to balance the discrepancy to the optimum. This behavior of modifying the level of stimulation is termed as <e2><80><9c>exploratory behavior<e2><80><9d> (Raju, 1980). Basically, the concept of exploratory behavior supports the understanding of the effects of stimulus repetition, response to stimulus characteristics (e.g., novelty), individual differences in exploratory behavior, and information-search behavior of consumers.

1833,The emotions and conduct,"The author begins this chapter with a discussion of the emotions as sources of human quality, noting organic conditioning and the variety of expression. Emotions like irritability, anger, indignation, and lament are all examined, as are their functional service, and their points of inlet, central diffusion, and outlet in primary situations. The author then describes emotion as a spur to meet urgent situations, as the zest of experience, and as motive to conduct. The relation of emotions and sensibilities is noted. The author then describes the motor aspect of emotions and emotional regulation, particularly in regard to sex and food situations--what he calls the luxurious sensibilities and esthetic emotion--before he analyzes the intellectual expansion. After examining the primary emotions, the author analyzes fear as a primitive emotion. The expression of emotion is described, including facial and related miens and expression as incipient response, and the attitudes, situations, direction, and stages of emotional expression. Illustrations from animal responses are provided to illuminate the author's point. From this starting point, the author discusses the complexity of human emotion, the refinement of emotion and of its expression, facial language and its principles, mien and gesture, and the varied sources of facial expression. Also described are specialized expressions, differentiation and transfer, and natural and acquired expression, such as manner and restraint. The author then discusses emotion and its object, the role of instinct, and the complication and interplay of the emotions, such as attention interest and curiosity. The flexibility and evolution of emotions are then examined, in both presentative and representative stages. The emotional movement from pain to grief is analyzed, as is the intellectualization of emotions. Special bearings of the principle of transfer are discussed, including transfer in expression, emotional congeniality in transfer, and the evidence of language; gregariousness and sociability are used as examples. The author concludes by reiterating that emotion is central in human quality, again describing its sources and persistence.

1834,Alignment and affiliation in narratives in conversations between speakers of American English and Japanese,"This study is an investigation of (dis)alignment and (dis)affiliation in narrative conversations in English. The analytical focus is on the teller's approaches for eliciting an assessment from the recipient, and the recipient's questioning behaviors to request further information. Conversation analysis (CA) is employed to analyze and interpret data from fourteen naturally occurring, mundane conversations between American and Japanese participants. Three conversations were audio-taped only, and eleven were both audio- and video-taped. All recorded conversations were transcribed using CA conventions. The analysis of the data revealed the teller's approaches for eliciting an assessment from the recipient, with repetitions being most frequently observed. Gazing, nodding, and using gestures, and multiple approaches including elaborating on the story, repeating a point, and emphasizing important words in a louder voice, were also observed. The analysis also revealed that minimal responses from the recipient such as ""I see"" did not necessarily indicate the recipient's understanding of the story. The recipient's assessments and comments functioned as a barometer of the degree of understanding. Several types of recipient questioning behaviors were identified, including initiating repair, requesting background information, prompting further story, expressing disagreement, and assisting the teller to continue the story. These questions indicated the degree to which the recipient had understood the story, encouraged the teller to proceed with the story, satisfied the recipient's personal curiosity, showed the recipient's interest and involvement in the story, challenged the teller's interpretation of the story, and assisted the teller when in trouble. Whereas questions sometimes caused temporal derailment, they could also contribute to enhancing alignment and affiliation between the participants. Whether or not a particular question was an indication of (dis)alignment or (dis)affiliation depended on which aspect of the story the teller and the recipient focused on. Although the smooth flow of narratives might be preferable, in naturally occurring mundane conversations, the recipient sometimes needs to intervene in the teller's talk. What seems important in communication is to attain shared understanding in the end, even if the intervention delays the development of the narrative.

1835,Discovering Compositional Trends in Mars Rock Targets from ChemCam Spectroscopy and Remote Imaging,"Onboard the Mars rover ``Curiosity'', ChemCam contains two instruments that gather geological data in the form of remote micro images (RMI) for geologic context and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for chemical composition. By analyzing the geochemical compositional depth trends of rocks, surface layers are identified that provide clues to the past atmospheric and aqueous conditions of the planet. LIBS produces the necessary data of chemical depth profiles with successive laser shots. To quickly identify these surface layers, we fit a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) to LIBS depth profiles on rock targets. The learned GGM is a visual representation of conditional dependencies among the set of shots making for faster identification of targets with interesting depth trends that warrant more in-depth analysis by experts. We show that our learned GGMs reveal information about the compositional trends present in rock targets that match observations made in more focused studies on these same targets. RMI images provide complementary details about the rock surface. Using RMI and LIBS features, we can cluster similar rock targets by the properties of the rock's surface texture and depth profile. We present results that show our machine learning methods can help analyze both the breadth and depth of data collected by ChemCam.","Oyen, Diane and Lanza, Nina and Porter, Reid",0,,1317
1841,"A comparison of the personality profiles of internal medicine residents, physician role models, and the general population","Purpose. To compare personality profiles of internal medicine residents with those of the general population and positive role models in medicine. Method. A widely used personality inventory, NEO PI-RO, which measures five major personality factors and 30 important personality facets, was administered in 1998 to 104 physicians in internal medicine residency and earlier to a nationwide sample of 188 physicians selected as positive role models in medicine. Results. The internal medicine residents, compared with the general population, were more likely to be attentive, to have deeper intellectual curiosity, to have higher aspiration levels, to have more vivid imaginations, to be more receptive to their emotions, to be interested in mental stimulation, and to think carefully before acting. The residents, compared with role models in medicine, were less eager to face challenges, less able to control their impulses, less able to cope with adversity, less easygoing, and less relaxed, but were more likely to crave excitement. Conclusion. Internal medicine residents and positive role models in medicine have some distinct personal qualities. Understanding the qualities of successful physicians can be helpful in career counseling of medical students and young physicians.","Hojat, M and Nasca, T J and Magee, M and Feeney, K and Pascual, R and Urbano, F and Gonnella, J S",0,10.1097/00001888-199912000-00017,1318
1842,American High Schools and the Liberal Arts Tradition,"The term ""liberal arts"" usually conjures up one central idea; that is, effective liberal arts education as strong academic achievement. A second, less dominant, and frequently neglected notion regards effective liberal arts education as producing intellectual interests and habits that endure throughout adult life. The two ideas are complementary and not in opposition. But they are different. The dominant idea associates the liberal arts with a collection of academic subjects or disciplines, most often divided into three broad and overlapping groups. For example, they are labeled by the National Center for Education Statistics as humanities, social and behavioral sciences, and natural sciences. The second idea about the liberal arts tradition is that what begins as a required activity assessed just after instruction should become voluntary behavior engaged in for curiosity and pleasure. The ultimate agenda of the liberal arts is how a person lives his or her life--what that person is like as an adult and not merely as a youth at the time school graduation requirements have been met. The ultimate product of an effective liberal arts education is active reflection about serious ideas. Enduring intellectual interests are to be created and pursued long after required courses and examinations are over and done with. This essay explores both the academic achievement side of the liberal arts tradition and the enduring intellectual interests side as they have played out in American high schools. The author discusses three historical windows that further illuminate the interplay among ideas about the liberal arts. First is the work of Charles W. Eliot at the end of the nineteenth century which crystallized ideas about the content and purpose of modern high school academics. Second is the reaction against Eliot's work by the professional custodians of the rapidly expanding American high school. A third window is the role of elite higher education, especially in the first half of the twentieth century, as guardian and primary generator of the liberal arts tradition. Comments by Jeffrey Mirel and Richard J. Murnane are presented. (Contains 64 notes.)","Powell, Arthur G",0,,1319
1843,Motivation in Instructional Design. ERIC Digest,"The ARCS Model of Motivational Design, developed by John M. Keller of Florida State University, is a systematic model for designing motivating instruction. The ARCS Model identifies four essential strategy components for motivating instruction: attention strategies for arousing and sustaining curiosity and interest; relevance strategies that link to learners' needs, interests, and motives; confidence strategies that help students develop a positive expectation for successful achievement; and satisfaction strategies that provide extrinsic and intrinsic reinforcement for effort. Since the ARCS Model was introduced in the early 1980s, several instruments have been developed for assessing the motivational quality of instructional situations. The Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) asks students to rate 36 ARCS-related statements in relation to the instructional materials they have just used. Other ARCS-based evaluation instruments include the Motivational Delivery Checklist and the Website Motivational Analysis Checklist. (WebMAC). ARCS provides a useful framework for both the design and improvement of the motivational quality of a range of informational entities--from classroom instruction to Internet resources.

1844,The educational approach of virtual science centers: Two Web cast studies (the Exploratorium and La CitÃ© des sciences et de l'Industrie),"This chapter looks at ways of examining informal e-learning environments to address innovative pedagogy, from two well-known institutions, where the theme of science is promoted within virtual centers, in a manner that is motivating for both online and onsite visitors. The author argues that real-time interactions such as Web casting act as a focus that enriches the people's interest and thus enhances the notion of Public Understanding of Research (PUR), while ""being socialized"" through the scientific community. Science centers have recently expanded their mission beyond hands-on interactive exhibits, by adopting a reflective perspective drawn from a multidisciplinary approach to technological progress; that is, covering sociological, political, historical, philosophical and even ethical issues through online conferences and live demonstrations for visitors to become involved in topical debates. This allows them to form their own viewpoints on contemporary concerns ranging from genetic engineering and sustainability to space exploration. Within the diversity of educational resources offered by virtual science centers, it is suggested that museologists should emphasize a comprehensive description of scientific-related matters, tackling subjects, people and places, rather than objects themselves in order to genuinely fulfill a social need and arouse the audience's curiosity. <c2><a9> 2005, Idea Group Inc.","Bernier, R",0,10.4018/978-1-59140-591-7.ch019,1321
1845,Using targeted design interventions to encourage extra-role crowdsourcing behavior,"Crowdsourcing has seen a substantial increase in interest from researchers and practitioners in recent years. Being a new form of work facilitated by information technology, the rise of crowdsourcing calls for the development of new theoretical insights. Our focus in this article is on extra-role behavioremployees' voluntary activities, which are not part of their prescribed duties. Specifically, we explored how user interface design can help increase extra-role behavior among crowdsourcing workers. In a randomized experiment, we examined the joint effects of the presentation of a performance display to crowdsourcing workers and the personal attributes of these workers on the workers' likelihood to engage in extra-role behavior. The experimental setting included an image analysis task performed on an environmental monitoring website. We compared workers' behavior across the different experimental conditions and found that the interaction between the presence of a performance display and the workers' personality trait of curiosity has a significant impact on the likelihood of engaging in extra-role behavior. In particular, the presence of a performance display was associated with increased likelihood of extra-role behavior among low-curiosity workers, and no change in extra-role behavior was observed among high-curiosity users. Implications for design are discussed.","Nov, Oded and Laut, Jeffrey and Porfiri, Maurizio",0,10.1002/asi.23507,1322
1846,CO-OPERATION AND COMPETITION: HOW PARTICIPATION IN ACADEMIC COMPETITIONS,"Non-traditional, project based, student-focused learning and academic competitions support and enhance traditional teaching and learning. This brief research review highlights three key benefits for students involved in this type of education: An increased number of students choosing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects at University level; the opportunity for students to compete and excel in academic competition similar to physical sport competition; and increased acquisition of key employability `soft' skills, namely, team work, communication and problem solving. This learning format supports and enhances traditional school learning when students learn to communicate with their peers and teachers differently. The educator is facilitator and students feel comfortable to explore and test new ideas, thus developing their own learning. Many competition projects are based around Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Surveys indicate that club, project and competition based learning can provide a type and level of engagement with science learning beyond the capability of a traditional classroom science. There is evidence to suggest a significant relationship between the number of STEM clubs that students participate in and their choice of a STEM major at University. Survey research indicates a link between student participation in academic competitions at high school and their choice of a related post-secondary education programme. Further, it indicates that participation in competition may in fact be more important in this respect than participation in school science classes - even where enhanced elements have been added. Competitions, and the extracurricular preparation activities that accompany them, expose students to information about science and science careers that may not generally be found within the curriculum. Competition offers an opportunity for students to compete and excel on a mental level much the way they do on a physical level in sports. Contests can prompt students to strive for excellence if their parents and teachers view competition positively. Cooperative team projects can increase social interest and community service through participation in community outreach or STEM-based community projects. Survey research indicates that these impacts also extend to peers, families and community members. 21st Century skills - communication, teamwork and problem solving - so important for employability - are embedded in all four of the project-based competitions referred to in this paper. Related research on social skills in relation to employability indicates that social adjustment at age 11 correlates to the likelihood of employment in later life. Destination Imagination (DI) is one of several organisations around the world offering this type of learning. It annually provides seven fun and engaging open-ended challenges that foster additional work with STEM, Performing Arts and Community Outreach, and is designed to bridge the increasing gap between our emerging digital and human ecosystem and what students are learning in school.","Harper, Jan",0,"is a global, not-for-profit organization, headquartered in the USA, and with 200,000 participants annually, in 32 countries and reaching over a and million students in the last 15 years.

1847,The Compensation Effect of Civic Education on Political Engagement: How Civics Classes Make Up for Missing Parental Socialization,"The development of political engagement in early life is significant given its impact on political knowledge and participation. Analyses reveal a large influence of parents on their offspring<e2><80><99>s curiosity about politics during their teenage years. Increasingly, civic education is also considered an important influence on political interest and orientations of young people as schools are assigned a crucial role in creating and maintaining civic equality. We study the effects of civic education on political engagement, focusing especially on whether and how civic education can compensate for missing parental political socialization. We use data from the Belgian Political Panel Study (2006<e2><80><93>2011) and the U.S. Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study (1965<e2><80><93>1997), which both contain information on political attitudes and behaviors of adolescents and young adults, those of their parents, and on the educational curriculum of the young respondents. Our findings suggest that civics training in schools indeed compensates for inequalities in family socialization with respect to political engagement. This conclusion holds for two very different countries (the U.S. and Belgium), at very different points in time (the 1960s and the 2000s), and for a varying length of observation (youth to old age and impressionable years only). <c2><a9> 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Neundorf, A and Niemi, R G and Smets, K",0,10.1007/s11109-016-9341-0,1324
1848,A case study showing how one young child represented issues concerned with attachment and separation in her spontaneous explorations,"This paper presents a case study of a young child, demonstrating evidence of a connection between enveloping objects and understanding presence and absence of a temporary and permanent nature. The starting point for the researcher was: an interest in identifying schemas or repeated patterns in order to understand cognitive development and; a curiosity as to why young children explore certain schemas at particular times, sometimes quite extensively. Eight children were observed systematically over time. Video observations were viewed by the researcher alongside the children's parents and workers to make tentative connections between cognition and affect (Jordan and Henderson 1995). In order to link cognition and affect, the author drew on schematic theory (Piaget 1956, 1951; Athey 1990, 2007) and psychoanalytic theory (Bowlby 1997; Winnicott 1960, 1991). The paper shows how the biological patterns (schemas) are fleshed out by each child's socio-cultural context, thereby drawing on a third strand, the work of Vygotsky (1978, 1986).","Arnold, Cath",0,10.1080/13502930802689103,1325

Using as primary sources Eliot's notebooks, letters, journals, book reviews and essays, the article demonstrates that Eliot's original curiosity about Islam arose in conjunction with her keener, more sympathetic interest in Judaism, and examines whether Eliot's reading of English and European intellectuals interested in Islamic culture had any impact on her own attitude towards Islam. Indeed, while Eliot's various and dispersed comments often reflect a shallow, essentially prejudiced view of the matter, her writing in fact evolved towards more tolerant views over the years.","Chenni, D",0,10.4000/cve.2032,1326

Turning pages in almost any of the volumes can be a delight to anyone whose curiosity is piqued by the easy opportunity to cross boundaries to areas seemingly distant from one's own, yet rarely unrelated to it. The book is extraordinarily useful not only in its prime function as a resource on current knowledge but also as a convenient measure of the philosophy and assumptions of mental health in the 1960's.

Where students in science are required to collect their own (unique) data, interest, motivation and curiosity are greatly improved. Motivation also increases where the learner is given ownership of the process used to develop a solution and is supported in developing ownership of the task. Ownership can result from requiring students to undertake small pieces of research of their own choosing. Analysis of own data is not confined to the sciences. In teaching management to mature students, learning is more effective where the data is derived from ones own place of employment: 'Some had spent a long time finding it, but it was their own data!

1854,Fast-forwarding disgust conditioning: US pre-exposure facilitates the acquisition of oculomotor avoidance,"During human development, disgust is acquired to a broad range of stimuli, from rotting food to moral transgressions. Disgust's expansion surely involves associative learning, yet little is known about Pavlovian disgust conditioning. The present study examined conditioned disgust responding as revealed by oculomotor avoidance, the tendency to look away from offensive stimuli. In two experiments, oculomotor avoidance was acquired to a neutral image associated with a disgusting image. However, to our surprise, participants initially dwelled on disgusting images, avoiding them only after multiple exposures. In Experiment 1, this ``rubbernecking'' response delayed oculomotor avoidance of the associated neutral image. In Experiment 2, we exhausted rubbernecking prior to conditioning by repeatedly exposing participants to the disgusting images. This procedure elicited earlier oculomotor avoidance of the associated neutral stimulus, essentially fast-forwarding conditioning. These findings reveal competing motivational tendencies elicited by disgust stimuli that complicate associative disgust learning.","Armstrong, Thomas and Engel, Mira and Press, Trevor and Sonstroem, Anneka and Reed, Julian",0,10.1007/s11031-019-09770-0,1330

Curiosity is the desire to create or discover more non-random, non-arbitrary, regular data that is novel and surprising not in the traditional sense of Boltzmann and Shannon but in the sense that it allows for compression progress because its regularity was not yet known. This drive maximizes interestingness, the first derivative of subjective beauty or compressibility, that is, the steepness of the learning curve.

Practice-related motives (e.g., diagnostics and improved treatment) and ideological motives (e.g., identification with a certain school of psychiatry or follower of a particular therapeutic discipline) also play an important role in the encouragement of research, the formation of new hypotheses, and the development of theories. The human individual's curiosity and need to understand and conquer the unknown are important factors in any type of research work.

1864,Science Experiences for Your Highly Able Child,"For teachers and parents, it is important to offer children opportunities for sensory exploration and wonder that capitalize on questioning and curiosity. This article discusses three areas to assist parents in addressing the scientific interests of their children, in terms of understanding what should be happening at school and how it can be supplemented at home: (a) inquiry; (b) leveraging students' natural scientific curiosity; and (c) authentic applications. In order for the highly able child to remain engaged in scientific topics, science experiences must emphasize content in the physical, life (biological), Earth, and space sciences equally. Children who exhibit aptitude and interest in science need to be engaged in real-world problem-solving opportunities that closely resemble what experts in the field are doing. Parents may need to seek science-focused alternative experiences for their children outside of school hours, including weekends and summers. Additionally, children can also seek the assistance of mentors in scientific fields where their curiosities lie, engaging experts in finding and solving scientific problems and blending theoretical knowledge learned in school with personal curiosity not yet explored. Parents can ask themselves, do we provide experiences that resemble problem-based learning by discussing science-related scenarios that we see in the local news? Capitalizing on the scientific curiosity of the child can assist parents with an initial search of local, state, national, and international experiences. Local libraries can also be accessed for resources on weekends and during the summer months.","Hendricks, Paige and Chandler, Kimberley",0,,1335
1865,In- and Out-of-Class Influences Affecting the Development of Students' Intellectual Orientations. ASHE Annual Meeting Paper,"This paper estimates the relative importance of three, theoretically interrelated sets of variables on changes in students' intellectual curiosity and interest in learning for its own sake. Variables being analyzed are: (1) students' curricular experiences; (2) students' formal instructional experiences and classroom-related contacts with faculty members; and (3) students' out-of-class experiences with faculty, peers, and the formal co-curriculum. The major purpose was to assess the extent to which student interest in learning is shaped by both formal academic activities and by their out-of-class experiences. Data from a group of 210 students who participated in a Spring 1992 survey and followup surveys show that what happens to students after they matriculate has a substantially greater influence on what and how much they learn than their precollege personal and academic development. Study analysis also revealed that both students' class-related experiences and their out-of-class experiences made statistically significant and unique contributions to the explanation of variations in intellectual orientations above and beyond students' precollege traits and their experiences in other areas of college life.

It treats occasionally of human physique in a manner which is scientifically interesting, but does not anywhere, in my opinion, present a theory of man's physical evolution from animal ancestors. It foreshadows much of the speculation about cultural progress which has been current during the last 150 years, touching also on the origins of religion and language, Its rather scanty remains represent a period of seven or eight centuries, the same during which medicine and some other branches of science were actively pursued or initiated by the Greeks. <c2><a9> 1964, Antiquity Publications Ltd.

1869,Simulated ecological environments for education: A tripartite model framework of hci design parameters for situational learning in virtual environments,"While there are many studies on collaborative or guided scientific inquiry in real, virtual, and simulated environments, there are few that study the interplay between the design of the simulation and the user interface. The main research aim was to decompose the simulation and user interface into the design parameters that influence attention, curiosity, inquiry, and learning of scientific material and acts of creation for children. The research design investigates what tools support independent exploration of a space, enhance deep learning, and motivate scientific or creative inquiry. A major interest is in the role that ecological context plays in the perception of spatial information. None of the prior work on learning in virtual environments considered a child-centric computer interaction framing, independent of pedagogy and focused on the impact of user interface parameters, such as image quality and navigational freedom. A major contribution of this research is the construction of the Virtual Trillium Trail, as it represents one square mile of biologically accurate scientific plot study data. It is a virtual environment based on statistical data visualization, not fantasy. It allowed for a highly realistic simulation and scientifically true-to-life visualization, as well as for a planned orthogonal contrast with exceptionally high internal validity in both system and statistical research design. Of critical importance is evidence in the pilot study, that virtual reality field trips for students may be used to prime before and to reinforce after a real field trip. This research also showed transfer effects on in-situ learning activity, in both directions. Thus, supports the claim that virtual environments may augment educational practices, not replace them, to maximize the overall learning impact. The other large contribution was in the activity analysis of the real field trip, where the Salamander Effect is observed as an environmental event, which opened a Teachable Moment event for the teacher, and which was then translated into a system design feature, a Salient Event in the user interface. A main part of this research is the importance of such events, as ways to support intrinsic learning activity, and leverage episodic memory. The main empirical contribution to the design of educational virtual environments was produced by the 2x2 ANOVA with the factors of Visual Fidelity and Navigational Freedom, set to high and low levels, and the evidence of different effects on Knowledge Gained. The tool has an impact on intrinsic learning, which is measured here by a pre-test and a post-test on facts and concepts. A two-factor analysis of variance showed a significant effect of Visual Fidelity on Knowledge Gained, F(1,60) = 10.54, p = 0.0019. High Visual Fidelity condition has a greater impact on Knowledge Gained (M = 30.95, SD = 14.76), than Low Visual Fidelity condition (M = 19.99, SD = 13.39). Photorealistic versions had a stronger impact on learning than cartoon versions. There was significant interaction between Visual Fidelity and Navigational Freedom, F(1,60) = 4.85, p = 0.0315, with the largest impact in the combined conditions of High Visual Fidelity and High Navigational Freedom on Knowledge Gained (M = 37.44, SD = 13.88). Thus, photorealistic, free navigation virtual environments double learning, when compared to cartoon versions, ceteris paribus. The next major contribution to the design of the user interface in educational virtual environments is the design and use of Salient Events as components to augment the virtual environment and to facilitate intrinsic inquiry into facts and concepts. A two-factor analysis of variance showed a significant effect of Visual Fidelity on Salient Event counts, F(1,60) = 4.35, p = 0.00.

1871,PSYCHOLOGICAL REALITY AND THE ROLE OF THE TEACHER IN EARLY-EDUCATION,"The study of children's language development has been strongly influenced since the 1950s by linguistic research. How well, however, has the education of young children incorporated the concept of psychological reality, which interrelates the child's perceptual and cognitive development with linguistic and non-linguistic events in his/her environment? In reply to this question, the paper concentrates on `'sharing time'', known also as `'show and tell'', which has both affective and cognitive value. Although sharing time is a student-centered activity, the teacher plays a pivotal role in establishing its context, structure and norms. Feedback from the teacher and peers promotes language development, and the growth of curiosity and inquisitiveness. The article is derived from experience in teaching kindergarten teachers to conduct sharing time periods in Saudi Arabia. Practical suggestions are made for the implementation of the activity, in the interests of encouraging spontaneous and personalized language rather than focusing on evaluation of students' competence in the formal aspects of language development.","ALSAFI, A T",0,10.1007/BF01103004,1340

1875,Inventory of engineering motives,"The following ""major interests and instincts"" appear to be characteristic of engineering students and practitioners: (1) constructive instinct, (2) scientific curiosity in mechanisms, (3) abstract ideas of a quantitative nature, (4) precise observation and description of physical things, (5) practical application, (6) planning and organization, (7) manual activity and craftsmanship. Five statements, designed to indicate degree of interest or motive, were grouped under each main heading. The thirty-five statements were checked by 204 engineers, 88 commerce students, 25 students of vocational education, and 19 commerce women. It was concluded ""that the inventory blank provides the vocational counselor or personnel officer with a valid instrument by which he can quickly picture a student's engineering motives. When an interview is given, the profile instantly describes the motivating tendencies and saves considerable time for the counselor.""

1876,Social impact of digital media: Growth pattern of facebook in the Arab world,"An online survey is reported that was carried out with more than 385 social media users aged 18 and over and extracted from nine Arab countries; Bahrain, Egypt, Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Kuwait, Syria, Jordan and Yemen. This research focuses on the use of Facebook by a selected group called Open Media Library (OML) which have interests in social media use. The aim of this research is to understand how and why users utilise Facebook and what their attitudes and perceptions are towards the purposes of Facebook. It examines how OML users utilise information and knowledge posted on Facebook, their preferred topics and motivations and the gratifications they obtained. As stated in the literature, this research confirms that Facebook can be used/defined as communication, collaboration and resource-sharing, as well as for intercultural communication and intercultural relationships. Curiosity and escapism, communication and experience, friendship and entertainment and identification of news and events are the main motivations for using Facebook. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the future of social media and its impacts on intercultural communication, media use and intercultural relationships. <c2><a9> Media Watch.","Ziani, A.-K. and Elareshi, M and Alrashid, M",0,10.15655/mw/2017/v8i2/49011,1345

1880,Travelling to the 'other side': The occupied zone and Greek Cypriot views of crossing the green line,"Since the Turkish offensive on Cyprus in 1974, the United Nations buffer zone has functioned as a major barrier between the island's Greek and Turkish populations. Greek Cypriots were not permitted to cross into the Turkish north and vice versa. However, on 23 April 2003, these restrictions were lifted, resulting in a flood of cross-border travel by members of both communities, which has continued to grow into more than four million visits as of the end of 2004. There are many reasons why people travel to the other side, ranging from looking for the land of their ancestors, to gamble in the north's casinos, to visit sacred places, and out of sheer curiosity to see what the 'other side' is like. Nearly half of the Greek population, however, has not crossed into the Turkish part of the island for a variety of reasons, including ethical constraints and lack of interest. Based on a survey of 3,060 respondents, this paper examines the perceptions of Greek Cypriots in crossing the Green Line into the north for tourism and recreational purposes and analyses the reasons approximately half the population refuses to cross. <c2><a9> 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Webster, C and Timothy, D J",0,10.1080/14616680600585513,1347
1882,Mining Temporal Intervals from Real-Time System Traces,"We introduce a novel algorithm for mining temporal intervals from real-time system traces with linear complexity using passive, black-box learning. Our interest is in mining nfer specifications from spacecraft telemetry to improve human and machine comprehension. Nfer is a recently proposed formalism for inferring event stream abstractions with a rule notation based on Allen Logic. The problem of mining Allen's relations from a multivariate interval series is well studied, but little attention has been paid to generating such a series from symbolic time sequences such as system traces. We propose a method to automatically generate an interval series from real-time system traces so that they may be used as inputs to existing algorithms to mine nfer rules. Our algorithm has linear runtime and constant space complexity in the length of the trace and can mine infrequent intervals of arbitrary length from incomplete traces. The paper includes results from case studies using logs from the Curiosity rover on Mars and two other realistic datasets.","Kauffman, Sean and Fischmeister, Sebastian",0,,1348
1886,Children's astronomy: Implications for curriculum developments at key stage 1 and the future of infant science in england and wales,"Experience suggests that few areas of science could claim to capture the interest, curiosity and imagination of young children as much as astronomy does, few are more relevant and fundamental to their everyday lives, and few are more stimulating, motivating and fun. Infant and primary astronomy is concerned with more, however, than teaching concepts and process skills or about learning facts and figures. It is certainly more than simply knowing about the periodic changes associated with how the Earth, Sun and Moon move with respect to one another. It is about the nature of science and 'scientific' thought. It is about human achievement. It is about feelings and emotions; our relationships with each other and our relationships with nature. It is about the many important aspects of time, cycles and change. From this standpoint, radical changes to the early years astronomy component of a recently introduced and twice revised national science curriculum operating in all maintained schools throughout England and Wales are considered both misguided and premature. Exploring the nature of infant children's ideas and beliefs in certain astronomical areast concerns about the direction of curriculum developments and the status of early years science are discussed. <c2><a9> 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Slugs are an ideal organism for use in such a student-directed, hypothesis-driven experience. Slugs are inexpensive, easily collected, and low maintenance.

1889,Marketing undergraduates' attitudes towards query-based instructional machines as a possible learning medium,"Six hundred and seventy-one undergraduates completed a questionnaire concerning their reactions to the idea that parts of their degree programmes might be delivered via Query Based Instructional Machines. The latter are commonplace in museums and other cultural attractions. They are menu-driven and operate on the touch-screen principle, thus allowing the user to browse through whichever aspects of a subject the person finds most interesting. Cognitive, affective and conative responses were measured and related to students' personal characteristics, degree programme, year of study, level of academic attainment, psychological involvement with a course, and innate tendencies vis-a-vis need for cognition, curiosity, and change leadership. The sample comprised students on three categories of degree programme: marketing, computing, or humanities. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was completed using aggregated responses as dependent variables, degree type as the fixed factor (grouping variable), and personal characteristics and inclinations as covariates. There were a number of significant differences between the responses of the marketing students and students in the other groups.","Bennett, R and Kottasz, R",0,10.1111/1467-8535.00214,1351
1890,Awareness of American Brand Names in the Soviet Union,"A study was conducted to determine the extent to which familiarity with American brand names had spread beyond the tourist centers of Moscow and Leningrad, in a population group most likely to have curiosity about American products. The subjects, 82 English-speaking college students ages 18-25, were all students at Kharkov State University in the Ukraine. The questionnaires contained three types of questions: (1) questions which measured behaviors that could lead to an interest in American products; (2) questions probing familiarity with American brand name products, musicians and politicans; and (3) questions on Soviet Media usage. Results indicated that Soviets know a surprisingly wide range of American brands. Some of the most well-known categories were products traded on the black market, but others, such as automobiles, were those with which most respondents would have had no personal contact. Some product categories appeared to be well defined: cigarettes, blue jeans, soft drinks, automobiles. Other categories which are brand-rich in the United States appear to have no dominant players in the USSR: cosmetics, sports equipment, and ice cream. The fact that Kharkov University officials accepted the idea of an American advertising professor polling their students, and the eagerness with which students answered questions, suggests a tolerant atmosphere toward American brand advertising and competitive marketing practices.

1891,Increasing Female Participation in Advanced Level Mathematics: A Perspective from Students and Teachers in Zimbabwe,"The non-participation of girls in advanced mathematics has become a concern over a number of years. This study sought to find ways of increasing female participation in Mathematics at advanced level based on an understanding of the constraining factors to female participation in mathematics. The descriptive survey research design was adopted in this study in which questionnaires, interviews and observations were used as data collection instruments. Questionnaires were completed by ninety nine female students (sixty 'O' levels and thirty nine 'A' levels) and nine mathematics teachers. Interviews were conducted with three mathematics teachers, 10 'A' level female students who were not taking mathematics and twenty 'O' level female students. Classroom observations were also conducted in six Mathematics lessons. Each lesson lasted for forty minutes. The results of the study have revealed the following factors as limiting female participation in mathematics: perceived difficulty of the subject, lack of self confidence, anxiety, negative teacher attitudes, negative stereotypes about girl's math abilities, cultural belief that mathematics is a male domain and lack of knowledge about mathematics careers entail. The research findings also revealed that to promote female participation in advanced level mathematics, parents and teachers should: enhance girls' confidence about their math abilities; create a conducive classroom climate that enhances interest and curiosity in mathematics; expose girls to female role models who have succeeded in mathematics and provide information advice and guidance on mathematics careers. The study recommends that gender and cultural biases attached to mathematics should be de-emphasized at home and school and that mathematics teachers should adopt some of the more recent reform-based instructional strategies that actively engage students while the Government should give incentives to girls who study mathematics at higher levels in order to encourage young females to pursue mathematical careers.","Mandina, S and Mashingaidze, S S and Mafuta, J",0,,1353
1892,Encouraging Girls in Math and Science. IES Practice Guide. NCER 2007-2003,"This National Center for Education Research (NCER) Practice Guide is the second in a series of IES guides in education. The goal of this practice guide is to formulate specific and coherent evidence-based recommendations that educators can use to encourage girls in the fields of math and science. The target audience is teachers and other school personnel with direct contact with students, such as coaches, counselors, and principals. The practice guide includes specific recommendations for educators and the quality of evidence that supports these recommendations. This practice guide provides five recommendations for encouraging girls in math and science. These recommendations together form a coherent statement: To encourage girls in math and science, we need to begin first with their beliefs about their abilities in these areas, second with sparking and maintaining greater interest in these topics, and finally with building associated skills. The five recommendations are: (1) Teach students that academic abilities are expandable and improvable; (2) Provide prescriptive, informational feedback; (3) Expose girls and young women to female role models who have succeeded in math and science; (4) Create a classroom environment that sparks initial curiosity and fosters long-term interest in math and science; and (5) Provide spatial skills training.

1894,LEARNING BY DOING OF TRADITIONAL CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES. GYPSUM,"Active learning of construction techniques is a fundamental stage of architectural education. Learning by doing is much more important, if possible, in the field of traditional architecture, since getting to know materials and construction techniques at first hand contributes to their understanding. This study focuses on the teaching of a construction technique that is falling into disuse (gypsum flooring construction), and this kind of active education provides knowledge, facilitates the survival of the technique and its valorisation, and also the transmission of the dwindling know-how. In September 2015 a practical workshop was held in Rincon de Ademuz (Valencia, Spain) studying gypsum as a material and its traditional use, both for mortar and plaster, but mainly for flooring. The workshop was aimed not only at professionals (architecture students, architects, quantity surveyors or construction workers), but also at anyone interested in the subject, regardless of profile so that the students' profiles turned out to be an interesting mix. Ages, places of origin and motivations to attend the workshop were very different, which contributed to enriching the experience. The students' profile was multidisciplinary as was their curiosity and interests, meaning that all kinds of questions were answered. The workshop was structured in three parts. The first one consisted of a theoretical vision of gypsum as a material, its traditional and current production systems, its traditional use and validity in construction, were the first questions of the students to be answered. During the second part of the workshop a series of technical visits to traditional constructions of the area built using gypsum both on structural elements (floors and pillars) and coating (horizontal or vertical) were made. Some of the buildings remained in their original state and some had been intervened, so that students were also able to see the use of gypsum in restoration first-hand. The suitability of the material was emphasised as the most compatible material for these interventions since it was the one originally used. Finally, most of the workshop was devoted the practical use of gypsum under the directions of two master builders who shared their experience and knowledge. The students experimented and learned how to make mortar, they built the gypsum flooring of one of the rooms of the buildings used as experimental spaces, they also rendered the interior walls of the same buildings, always under the supervision and direction of the master builders, with a complete experience of knowledge of the material and its traditional applications. All the results of these works remain onsite in the building, which is a real structure and not an artificial base, so their behaviour over time can be studied and observed in a real situation, and by students of future workshops as well.","Garcia Saez, M Soledad and Tomas Marquez, Salvador and La Spina, Vincenzina and Mileto, Camilla and Vegas Lopez-Manzanares, Fernando",0,,1355

1896,Epilogue,"This volume comes out of a symposium staged in conjunction with an exhibit at the Honolulu Academy of Arts: Life in the Pacific of the 1700s: The Cook / Forster Collection of the George August University of G<c3><b6>ttingen. Displayed in that exhibit were some five hundred items of ethnological interest from New Zealand, Tonga, Tahiti, the Marquesas, New Hebrides, New Caledonia, Hawai'i, and the northwest coast of America, all collected during the second and third voyages of Captain James Cook (Little 2006; see Hauser-Sch<c3><a4>ublin 1998 and this volume; Kaeppler 1998; Urban 1998a).1 The exhibit was a major event in the annals of Euro-American museology and ethnology. Cook was not the first European to voyage in the Pacific, nor would he be the last (Meleisea and Schoeffel 1997), but Cook had a major impact on the European worldview and directed European curiosity (Kaeppler 1978) toward the Pacific. Cook's voyages generated a wealth of knowledge, inspiring the scientific and not just the popular imagination to conjure distant others. His ""expeditions were immediately famous among mariners, artists, writers and the wider public; it is no exaggeration to claim that they captured the attention of the epoch"" (Thomas 2005: 13). To the extent that Europe was central to the nascent globalizations of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, to the extent, too, that the greater Europe (including America) has now entered an era of political and representational decolonization, Oceanic encounters, yesterday and today, become central to a world history that requires careful narration and theorization. The various contributions to this volume constitute forays into that narration and theorization. Taken together, they begin to map the terrain of a history of Oceania's globalization. This epilogue summarizes what in my reading are the highlights of the conference. Pacific Island history has inspired some of the most important writings in historical anthropology. At the close, I use the conference to assess the new directions in that rich and ever-burgeoning field for this, an era of postcolonial dialogue and research. <c2><a9> 2011 University of Hawai'i Press.

1897,Indirect learning through communication,"Distance learning is getting matured. It has a great potential, however, this potential still has not fully recognized yet. A reason of this situation is in inappropriate use of new technologies and naive combinations of existing materials with remote access to them. For example, to show some dynamical features of an object/process, animation is used. However, very often, a style of animation is boring and provides more negative than positive impressions. Another example is approaches based on ``reading a book through computer screen.'' Just ``reading'' through learning sessions without essential support simplifying the perception and understanding the material can not be attractive, too. One more point is poor personalization of data/knowledge prepared and interfaces ignoring usage conditions and user's interests and levels. Though there is a great variety of important aspects to pay attention in distance learning, data/knowledge format, acquisition of data/knowledge in educational materials, and ways of access to the data/knowledge are the most crucial things to improve for demonstrating the above-mentioned potential. In this paper, we present a special-purpose communicator oriented to children with special needs. The communicator is based on an idea of self-explanatory technology where items of data/knowledge, as well as adaptive inter-faces are represented in multiple view formats. The children develop their vocabulary, curiosity and ability to make a choice and decision just through the process of sending/receiving messages in a language of pictures.","Mirenkov, Nikolay",0,,1358
1898,Pre-school Children Investigatory Activities in the Environment Created by Adults,"In order to create one's own model of world cognition, a child acquires information from the environment created around him/her, which ensures the development of child's explorative activity by arousing interest and curiosity, that later, in its turn, create the basis for learning motivation. Child's explorative activity is a means to cognize the world that has been essentially influenced by the environment created by adults. The problem arises, if adults do not understand child's activities that develop understanding about the world around. As a result, unreasonable criticism and evaluation from the adult's point of view can be observed. Thus, it is important to clarify how the environment created by adults influence explorative activity of a child and what are the facilitating and delaying factors. The article reveals the theoretical findings based on pedagogical and psychological research (M.Osorin, H.Gudjon, R.Hart, I.Malkin-Pih, N.Podiakov, T.Amabile, D.Liegeniece) on explorative activity of preschool age children, as well as the pedagogical observation of the author.","Grava, Jana",0,,1359
1899,Working with the developmental age in Gestalt therapy,"The story of my growth as a developmental psychotherapist begins with the typical anxieties of every novice psychologist. The reasons that were keeping me away from the world of children reflected fears that had to do with my sense of responsibility: I perceived the world of infancy as enormously complex, distant, governed by unique psychological principles, extremely fragile and far too precious for me to understand and offer myself as a valuable aid. The fear of making mistakes (making the wrong diagnosis, using the wrong approach, failing in my therapy attempts) paralyzed me. Gradually, however, over the years, a genuine interest has also taken over, filling me with curiosity, tenderness and affection for the world of children. Thanks to my ongoing development as a Gestalt therapist, the awareness of a continuity between childhood and adulthood was also growing inside of me. In other words, I was finding more and more evidence of the link between the psychological structure of adults-the users of the service I worked for at that time-and certain affective and relational characteristics that emerged when they told me about their personal histories. When I was allowed to work specifically with children and adolescents, to follow them through the years of their psychological growth, I was offered the specular point of view-the opposite pole-of the same phenomenon: the fact that the psychological structure of a person in his/her developmental age already contains predictors of a given adult personality profile was becoming clearer and clearer to me. This sense of continuity was what fascinated me and still keeps fascinating me today. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","Sampognaro, Giuseppe",0,,1360

1901,Thinking mathematically through discussions of reading comprehension strategies,"Problem solving is an integral part of mathematical learning. The process of mathematical reasoning can be traced back to early primary grade levels. As students get older, mathematical reasoning continues to be one of the leading components in mathematics. According to the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards (2008), mathematical reasoning combines the abilities to establish mathematical conjectures, process mathematical arguments and apply various types of representations. In order to establish these abilities, problem solving requires more instruction than the drill and practice approach. From my previous student teaching to my current teaching experience, I have noticed both strong and weak math students struggle in the problem solving process. Students seem to sigh upon the ideas of justifications and explanations within their solution and prefer computing strictly with numbers. However, these students were capable of doing mathematics and making sense of the concepts. As an educator, the challenge rested on devising a shift in thinking for students to understand the value of problem solving. How can I connect components in mathematical reasoning into the students' daily activities while enhancing the understanding of the process in problem solving? I narrowed my curiosity to connecting reading comprehension as an embedded approach in the mathematical problem solving approach. In my search to understand a relationship between reading comprehension and mathematical reasoning, I centered my research on using a mathematical reading circle similar to the idea of a literature circle to bridge the connection. Particularly, I was interested in understanding how different reading comprehension strategies can impact the learning and understanding of problem solving. These series of curiosities and interests led me to my research question: how does the implementation of specific reading strategies: monitor/clarify, visualization, question, and summarization in a mathematical reading circle change 5 th grade students' comprehension skills to solve word problems?

1902,Logos and Pathos. Thought and Emotions in the Therapy of Words,"'The days when psychology exercised it powers are ending', declared Gerd Achenbach, in 1981, in his book Philosophische Praxis, a manifesto of the new discipline of dialogue. Since then, the bibliography on the subject has progressively expanded, initially in Europe and subsequently in America. In Europe - with the exception of Holland, where it has taken on the connotations of Business Philosophy-philosophical counselling has retained more of a thinking aspect, along with a certain diffidence as regards being defined as treatment. In the Anglo-Saxon world, it has instead pragmatically assumed the title of the last horizon of the therapy of conversation. The curative value of philosophical counselling is however of a nominal, one might say even 'philosophical', nature. Discomfort is never reduced to illness; the patient is not labelled and inserted into a category of pathology. The inadequate schemes of the thought, of the behaviour or the emotiveness of each individual are superior to the psychiatric clusters defining them. Whoever acts-albeit contentedly-according to an exclusively medical paradigm, is not only not practicing philosophical counselling but is not even practicing a true psychotherapy. The radicalism of Achenbach's language - from our point of view - poses another problem: at what point is the development of psychotherapy? And also: what innovation can the use of these philosophical instruments contribute to the practice of psychotherapy? This article. which attempts to provide a response to these questions, is divided into four sections. In the first chapter, the specificum of all clinical psychology is defined, from the Viewpoint of the reversal' and the lesson of the Viennese master to the latest generation of cognitive psychologies. The view point of the reversal is the curiosity which discerns the reverse side of things, stimulating the discovery of the profound nucleus of individual beliefs, thus making it possible to assume responsibility for their ambiguity. This endo-psychic perspective is inflexible; it is the essence of the 'soul's making'. The second and the third chapters deal with the state of the art of present day psychotherapy, in its two coordinates: relational and cognitive. The thin thread which links the logical analysis of the 'personal vision of the world' by philosophical counselling to the meta-cognitive vision of psychotherapy is recognized also by important theorists of philosophical counselling themselves. However, the interest of this article and the barycentre of the fourth and final chapter is the contribution of criticism and potential innovation which philosophical counselling claims to contribute versus psychotherapy.

1903,Personality characteristics of volunteers for thanatological research,"In an investigation of volunteers for thanatological research, 237 college students were presented with the option of completing the Do It Yourself Death Certificate (DIYDC) as a component of a test battery which included an omnibus personality inventory and measures of dissimulation, locus of control, anxiety and Machiavellianism. A total of 75 males and 97 females completed the DIYDC. Completers demonstrated a tendency toward scientific interest in death, rather than morbid curiosity about it. There was no differential rate of completion as a function of gender, anxiety, dissimulation, locus of control or Machiavellianism. It was concluded that student volunteers for thanatological research constitute a reasonably representative cross section of student volunteers for general psychological research and that the usefulness of the DIYDC in death workshop settings may be reliably extended to large sample survey research applications.","Mahoney, J and Kyle, D",0,10.2190/LGRV-1Q84-K9EN-D5BL,1364
1905,Tourism,"This chapter provides an overview and critical discussion of the principal approaches to the study of language(s) and intercultural communication within the specific context of tourism. During the second half of the twentieth century, the number of people travelling has grown significantly, generating large revenues for the many and varied institutions of the tourist establishment and increasing opportunities for intercultural and multilingual encounters between tourists/guests and locals/hosts. Despite this fact, little scholarly attention has been devoted to the study of communication and language use in intercultural interactions between tourists and locals, although there is comparatively more research on the communicative strategies of the various intermediaries (e.g. tour guides, travel agents) that have an important influence on these interactions. This lack of research on naturally occurring intercultural communication in tourist settings is lamentable, not simply because of the potential economic contribution to be gained from effectively orchestrated interactions, but also because these interactions take place in contexts of power and status differentials that reproduce symbolic (and economic) inequalities between interlocutors in tourism settings. There are, of course, many kinds of tourists with different motivations and modes for travelling, and thus different degrees of interest in interacting with locals. These variations in type and perspective on tourism influence the nature and extent of tourist engagement in intercultural communication. For some tourists, the opportunity to practice a foreign language while on holiday and to learn about new cultures and ways of life might be key to travel and the particular choice of destination. But how many of us actually take time to learn a second language - or at least much beyonda few key phrases or cultural curiosities from our guidebooks - before travelling? For others, perceived cultural and linguistic differences between themselves and their hosts might be viewed as potentially discomforting, even alienating or threatening, and can form the basis of prejudice. These emotional, or affective, elements of attitudes towards the culturally different can influence tourists choice of holiday destination (e.g. avoiding certain countries or regions seen to be too differe') or type of accommodation (e.g. choosing a large hotel complex with hosts who speak their language and offer a taste of the local culture that does not necessarily involve venturing far outside the conffnes of the resort). <c2><a9> 2012 Selection and editorial matter, Jane Jackson; individual chapters, the contributors.","Jack, G and Phipps, A",0,10.4324/9780203805640,1365
1906,The Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire in Mothers and Fathers of School-Aged Children,"Research on parental reflective functioning (PRF)-defined as parents' capacity to comprehend the developing mind of their child, reflect upon it, and hold in mind the inner life of the child-has mostly involved mothers of infants and young children, and rarely fathers and parents of school-aged children. The present study sought to extend research on PRF by examining aspects of the construct that are still scarcely explored, such as the role of gender and attachment; to investigate whether there were differences between mothers' and fathers' PRF and whether there were differences in PRF related to the gender and age of the child; and, finally, to assess the association between PRF and each parent's attachment style. The Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ) were administered to a community sample of mothers and fathers of 385 children aged 3-10 years. A multi-group factor analysis supported the hypothesized three-factor model among both fathers and mothers. Univariate and multivariate analyses of variance showed that mothers had higher levels of interest and curiosity in their children's mental states than fathers. Parents of daughters showed higher pre-mentalizing modes than parents of sons. Parents of preschool children showed less nonmentalizing modes than parents of children aged 8-10. Correlations between PRFQ and ASQ showed that both mothers' and fathers' interest in thinking about their child's internal experience and in taking the child's perspective were correlated with higher levels of secure attachment style.

1907,The Design Student Association â€œEtsidi-Designâ€ as an Active Tool in the Participation of the Students in the Formal Education in the Degree in Engineering in Industrial Design and Product Development,"The growth of technologies makes necessary redefining higher education. Students nowadays are more prepared to look up information all around the meanings, so we have to deal with new ways of teaching and collaboration. The creative capacity they show, and our background in art an art education are enabling new ways of learning and teaching. Some years ago in our School of Engineering, an association called Etsidi-Design was born and it has been able to mobilize hundreds of students. Since then they have been participating in active projects from different fields. This association is not only focused on design, but also on engineering technology, culture, art and other events related to the human behavior and interest. Our attention, as teachers, has been to collaborate together and to promote an horizontal learning with artistic projects, facilitating the means of our School and learning them to know and integrate their curiosities. The result of this collaboration has been to involve them to participate in the proposals of our classes<c2><a0>in the Degree in Engineering in Industrial Design and Product Development. Teachers have to facilitate new ways of learning, approaching students to their reality and preferences in learning.

Commentary on Paper by Claudie Massicotte,"In this commentary, stemming from Freud's conflictual interest in psychic phenomena, I examine current views of telepathy as reflected in controversial parapsychological research and theories of nonlocal mind. I hope to inspire readers' curiosity about the possible existence of telepathic communication by proposing clinical examples and raising the feasibility of the impact of the therapist's own predisposition and belief system. Finally I speculate about how findings from parapsychology research in combination with findings from neuroscience and quantum theory might influence the evolution of psychoanalytically based practice methods in the future.","de Peyer, Janine",0,10.1080/10481885.2014.870842,1368

1914,Introduction to Media Literacy History,"Why is it important for us to consider the history of media literacy? Beyond forging connections of the past to the present, exploring the history of the field can deepen intellectual curiosity and understanding for those who work in media literacy education, ignite interest in others, and drive investigation into understanding the relationships of the facets and fundamentals of media literacy from past to present and into the future. The theme of leadership emerges from questions such as: How do people build programs? How does information get disseminated? What were the challenges? Who were the learners? Who were the teachers? What were the tools? The discussions borne from these themes lead to questions about the influence of changes in society and technology over time to media literacy education. Just as our individual experiences shape and define our personal identities, a community's past and present shape how the field sees itself today and shapes a vision for the future.","Bordac, Sarah Evelyn",0,,1370

1919,Introduction: Origins and destinations,"This book will probably attract three main types of reader. One kind will consist of feminists, who are primarily interested in learning more about women<e2><80><99>s lives, in this case about women<e2><80><99>s opportunities<e2><80><94>or lack of opportunities<e2><80><94>for occupational achievement and movement between social classes. For this readership, the significance of the book will be its attempt to provide the first comprehensible description of female social mobility. A second, smaller audience will be those sociologists with a specialist knowledge of the sociology of social class and mobility. In a sense, they will be the reverse of the first audience, because their interest will be in mobility itself, here reported almost coincidentally about women. They will find, none the less, that conventional frameworks for mobility analysis are sharply tested when they are applied to female experiences. Our third readership will be drawn from the broader constituency of sociology and social science in general, with an equal curiosity about both women and social mobility. This group is likely to have less detailed background knowledge about these topics than the first two audiences do about one or the other subject. <c2><a9> Geoff Payne and Pamela Abbott 1990.","Payne, G and Abbott, P",0,10.4324/9780203974759,1372
1920,Interest development: Arousing situational interest affects the growth trajectory of individual interest,"Interest has become a central topic in the educational-psychology literature and Hidi and Renninger's (2006) four-phase model of interest development is its most recent manifestation. However, this model presently enjoys only limited empirical support. To contribute to our understanding of how individual interest in a subject develops in learners, two studies were conducted with primary school science students. The first study (N =187) tested the assumption that repeated arousal of situational interest affects the growth of individual interest. Latent growth curve modeling was applied and the results suggest that the arousal of situational interest has a positive effect on the development of individual interest and significantly influences its growth trajectory. The second study tested the assumption that engaging students with interest-provoking didactic stimuli, such as problems, is critical to triggering situational interest and increasing individual interest. To test this assumption, four classes of primary school students (N = 129) were randomly assigned to two conditions in a quasi-experimental setup. The treatment condition received four situational-interest-inducing science problems as part of a course whereas the control condition did not, all other things being equal. The results of latent growth curve modeling revealed that only the group receiving problems experienced repeated arousal of situational interest and its related growth in individual interest. Implications for, and amendments to, the four-phase model of interest development are proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

1921,What Makes Science Relevant?: Student Perceptions of Multimedia Case Learning in Ecology and Health,"The perception of science as boring is a major issue for teachers at all instructional levels. Tertiary classes especially suffer from a reputation for being dry, instructor-centered, and irrelevant to the lives of students. However, previous research has shown that science can be interesting to students if it is presented in such a manner as to generate personal curiosity and interest. This study explored the efficacy of two multimedia, case-based approaches to develop interest and perceptions of relevance in an introductory biology class. One of these approaches enabled students to test hypotheses about wolf ecology using radio telemetry data, while the other enabled them to play the role of a geneticist testing for genetic and infectious disease conditions. After completing both projects, 32 students volunteered to participate in one of four video-recorded focus interview groups to determine what non-majors in an introductory biology course think is relevant science to learn and why. Twelve trends in student views on relevance, the most important of which were potential use, curiosity, global relevance, and human relevance emerged from this study. Students preferred both case-based projects to lecture, and liked the project on human health better than the case project on wolf ecology. This research contributes significantly to understanding how personal curiosity and relevance motivate students in science classrooms.

1922,The Emerging Neuroscience of Intrinsic Motivation: A New Frontier in Self-Determination Research,"Intrinsic motivation refers to people's spontaneous tendencies to be curious and interested, to seek out challenges and to exercise and develop their skills and knowledge, even in the absence of operationally separable rewards. Over the past four decades, experimental and field research guided by self-determination theory (SDT; Ryan and Deci, 2017) has found intrinsic motivation to predict enhanced learning, performance, creativity, optimal development and psychological wellness. Only recently, however, have studies begun to examine the neurobiological substrates of intrinsic motivation. In the present article, we trace the history of intrinsic motivation research, compare and contrast intrinsic motivation to closely related topics ( flow, curiosity, trait plasticity), link intrinsic motivation to key findings in the comparative affective neurosciences, and review burgeoning neuroscience research on intrinsic motivation. We review converging evidence suggesting that intrinsically motivated exploratory and mastery behaviors are phylogenetically ancient tendencies that are subserved by dopaminergic systems. Studies also suggest that intrinsic motivation is associated with patterns of activity across large-scale neural networks, namely, those that support salience detection, attentional control and self-referential cognition. We suggest novel research directions and offer recommendations for the application of neuroscience methods in the study of intrinsic motivation.","Di Domenico, Stefano I and Ryan, Richard M",0,10.3389/fnhum.2017.00145,1375

1925,CHEMISTRY - AN EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE,"In the last two decades, it has been observed an increasing low enrolment of students in chemistry teaching courses in secondary schools. On the one hand, because of the negative connotation of chemistry, associated with the potentially toxic and pollutant chemical industry, and on the other hand, that the teaching of this subject is exclusively carried out only in a theoretical classroom environment with almost non-existent practical/experimental component, despite chemistry is an experimental science in its essence. This state of affairs has been reflected in chemistry degrees offered by Portuguese universities throughout the country, which in the application process for each academic year, ended up by never completely fulfilling the number of offered nunerus clausus. Considering that the pedagogical mission of the Faculty of Science and Technology of Universidade NOVA de Lisboa (FCT-NOVA), in particular its Department of Chemistry (DQ), aims to contribute to the human, scientific and technical development of students, a project has been settled in the last nine years in order to offer to high school students a unique opportunity to arouse in them the interest in Science in general and Chemistry in particular, to stimulate impart on them the joy of curiosity, while at the same time conferring the necessary skills for their future activity as students of higher education or in the labour market. It is also through the close contact with students that method, discipline, and intellectual honesty are transmitted and cultivated. The aim of this Project was thus to promote the study and taste interest for Chemistry, through experimental activities, fitting the Portuguese High School Education curricula, offered to students enrolled in Chemistry subjects attending the 10th, 11th and 12th grades (the latter, compulsory high school degree to apply to University Throughout 2016/17 academic year, DQ-FCT-NOVA will receive, from October to May, 1888 students visits from eleven High Schools distributed among Physical Chemistry for 10th/11th grade and of the 12th grade attending the Chemistry subject. The former are offer one single laboratory activity while the latter participate up to 10 different experimental activities. During 70 practical sessions of 2.5 hours each, with an average attendance of 27 students, the number of higher education school staff involved are 22. Each high school class is accompanied by 1 teacher, who's also proactively contributing to the design of the practical session. The session is carried out in groups of 2/3 students, and the laboratories have a capacity of 24/48 according onto classes sizes. A quality questionnaire is filled by the students in order to monitor the action. In 2015/16, 63 % of the students answered the questionnaire in which more than 90% students were very satisfied with the action. This project has already been implemented for 9 years reflecting a growing collaboration between FCT-NOVA and in High Schools in the vicinity (Setubal District). Above all, this Project allowed most of these schools to continue to motivate students to enrol in 12th grade Chemistry subject. Actually, in the first year of the initiative, many of these schools did not have enough students to open chemistry classes for the 12th grade. After the first initiative, almost all high schools have been able to maintain open 12th grade chemistry classes. On the other hand, FCT-NOVA, namely, the Applied Chemistry course, has been able to fill 100% of the numerus clausus available in the first phase of the application period, which is not the case for other higher education schools courses in Portugal for the same domain - Chemistry.","da Silva, M and Pereira, M M A and Franco, R and Dionisio M. and and Ferreira, L M and Branco, P and Costa, C and Lourenco, A and Pereira, A S and Mata, P and Sotomayor, J and Lima, C and Vilarigues, M and Parola, A J and Laia, C A T and Coutinho I.

1927,The Maestro of Ethology,"Psychologists and other behavioral scientists generally study animals for one of two reasons. One approach is to investigate animals because they may serve as a model system for a human behavior of interest. A second reason to study animals stems from a curiosity about how animals are able to successfully flourish in the face of real-world challenges. The most influential ethologist, at least in the Anglo American world, was Niko Tinbergen. Hans Kruuk, a student of his at Oxford University in the 1960s, has written a masterful biography of Tinbergen that brings Tinbergen to life for a new generation of behavioral scientists and simultaneously provides us with a useful primer of ethology as a scientific discipline. Niko's Nature: A Life of Niko Tinbergen and His Science of Animal Behaviour celebrates the many achievements of Tinbergen but also frankly addresses the complexities of Tinbergen, both as a person and a scientist. This is a very enjoyable book that is well worth reading by anyone interested in animal behavior and its place in the scientific world.

1929,"Cigarette users' interest in using or switching to electronic nicotine delivery systems for smokeless tobacco for harm reduction, cessation, or novelty: A cross-sectional survey of US adults","Introduction: We examined: (a) current (past 30-day) smokers' interest in using or switching to electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) or smokeless tobacco for various reasons; (b) correlates of interest in these products; and (c) subgroups of current smokers in relation to interest in these products. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey assessing sociodemographics, tobacco use, interest in ENDS and smokeless tobacco among smokers, and knowledge about ENDS among 2,501 US adults recruited through an online consumer panel. We oversampled tobacco users (36.7% current cigarette smokers), ethnic minorities, and southeastern US state residents. Results: On average, participants were more interested in ENDS than smokeless tobacco across all reasons provided. Additionally, they were less interested in either product because of their potential use in places prohibiting smoking or due to curiosity and more interested in reducing health risk or cigarette consumption or to aid in cessation. We documented high rates (27.9%) of misbeliefs about Food and Drug Administration approval of ENDS for cessation, particularly among current smokers (38.5%). Also, 27.2% of current smokers had talked with a health care provider about ENDS, with 18.0% reporting that their provider endorsed ENDS use for cessation. Furthermore, cluster analyses revealed 3 groups distinct in their interest in the products, sociodemographics, and smoking-related characteristics. Conclusions: This study highlights higher interest in ENDS versus smokeless tobacco and greater interest in both for harm reduction and cessation than due to novelty or smoking restrictions. Developing educational campaigns and informing practitioners about caveats around ENDS as cessation or harm reduction aids are critical.

1930,When new public management runs into democratization: Taiwan's public administration in transition,"This paper reviews the study of Taiwan politics in the field of public administration, focusing on the concurrence of two reforms: democratization and new public management (NPM). The most vehement criticism against NPM has been voiced by the advocates of substantial democracy. They believe that, by encouraging individuals to pursue maximized self-interest, this efficiency-oriented movement only serves to attenuate the moral dimensions of democratic life, leaving underdeveloped such values as social justice, equality, social solidarity, and public-spirited participation. Such an observation leads to the following intellectual curiosity: what would happen if one country were to go through both demoralization and NPM simultaneously, as is the case with many countries today? In an attempt to answer this question and to illustrate the dynamics between these two reforms, this paper examines Taiwan's history of administrative development. The findings challenge the common understanding that these two reforms are mutually incompatible. The main argument is that there is in fact a synergic interaction between the reforms during their initial phase. Because the NPM reforms actually advocate certain core values also shared by liberal democracies, and because NPM measures help fulfill certain political functions for regime transition, the two reforms actually reinforce each other early on in the process. Nevertheless, as democratization proceeds, such advanced goals as improving the quality of civil society and promoting grass-roots deliberation with regard to a collective future begin to be emphasized on the reform agenda. NPM at this later stage is found to impose challenges to further democratization.","Tang, C.-P.",0,,1381

Therefore, high dropout rates of over 50% and steadily dropping numbers of beginners in the engineering disciplines are the consequence. Only few women study these subjects. A report by the American Educational Foundation (AAUW 2000), states that women often argue we can but we don't want to.

In previous work on recommending information, such as through WWW pages, the user could not always get his/her needed information, since the user's interests were represented only in keywords or key categories, and the contents of the presented information were previously formed by the information presenter; consequently, this information did not necessarily match the user's interests and knowledge. In the proposed method, the system acquires the user's implicit and/or explicit interests and knowledge from a question-and-answer interaction and presents the user with focus-of-interest information based on them. For personalizing the presentation and recommendation of information, the system provides each user with a information retriever using the user's operation records, a personal conceptual space, and control knowledge.","Kobayashi, K and Sumi, Y and Mase, K",0,,1384

1941,"Popular beliefs, media, and biotechnology","For the nonscientist, evaluating scientific information (such as data on uncertain but likely risks) has much in common with buying a used car.1 As wary consumers, we need both technical and social information. We think it is important to have technical data on the car<e2><80><99>s gas mileage, its history of ownership and use, its age, engine performance, mechanical condition, and so on. Yet we also want social information, such as what kind of reputation the seller, the manufacturer, and the specific make and model have; who the sellers are; and why they want to sell the car (why they might, for example, be anxious to sell). In short, we want to know whether information is being hidden-or For example, the active manipulation of genetic material-of agricultural species, even of people-can be framed as the latest in a long series of benign applications of scientific knowledge, the newest chapter in a story that began with the selective breeding of plants and animals-or perhaps earlier, with the first appearance of medicine, representing the marriage of human curiosity and a humane desire to reduce suffering. Alternatively, genetic engineering and other forms of biotechnology2 can be seen as the ultimate Frankensteinian threats to life as we know it, conjuring up images of monstrous combinations of disparate living parts, of ecosystems laid waste by the invasion of new and unaccountably more aggressive species, and of designer babies whose gender, color, and IQ are made up to parental specifications. In this interpretation, interest in human genetic engineering appears to spring less from humane concern than from a desire to eliminate imperfections (real or perceived) and breed Supermen. Similarly, some may see interest in agricultural bioengineering as springing less from a desire to eliminate human hunger than from corporate profiteering and an irresponsible impulse to tinker. <c2><a9> 1999 by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.","Priest, S H",0,10.4324/9781410601360-13,1388

1947,Finding science is fun in a ``Magic Show of Light'' from Optical Demonstrations on an Overhead Projector for elementary school students,"We seek methods of stimulating young school children to develop an interest in science and engineering through a natural curiosity for the reaction of light. Science learning now begins fully at middle school. Reading skills develop with activity at home and progress through the elementary school curriculum, and in a like manner, a curious interest in science also should begin at that stage of life. Within the ranks of educators, knowledge of optical science needs to be presented to elementary school students in an entertaining manner. One such program used by the authors is Doug Goodman's Optics Demonstrations With the Overhead Projector, co-published by and available from OSA (Optical Society of America) and SPIE-The International Society of Optical Engineering. These demonstrations have been presented in middle and high schools; however, as a special approach, the authors have developed selected Goodman demonstrations as a ``Magic Show of Light'' for elementary schools. Teachers in the U.S. are overloaded with classroom instruction specifically targeted at improving reading and math scores on the Standard Achievement Test (SAT); therefore, science is getting ``short changed'' in the education system.

For him, one of the candidate substances is a neurotropic toxin extracted from an Escherichia coli. In addition to his laboratory research, Baruk reports clinical observations that allow him to confirm the hypothesis of catatonic syndromes by hepatic (biliary) poisoning. Continuing in this direction, he also describes cases of schizophrenia which he attributes the symptoms to an infection with E. coli and which seems to have been cured by an appropriate antibiotic treatment. These facts prompted Baruk challenged the uniqueness of the concept of schizophrenia. Throughout his career, he defended the interest of looking behind the psychotic manifestations, the possible biological causes, especially toxic and infectious. This approach was very controversial, even totally despised at the time, before progressing gradually to the rank of (pseudo) scientific curiosity disconnected from the daily clinical reality. But recent discoveries on the influence of the immune system, inflammation, digestive system, and especially the microbiota, on the nervous system, brain and mental state, necessarily question this observation, perhaps not so wacky<e2><80><a6> <c2><a9> 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Estingoy, P",0,10.1016/j.amp.2019.06.003,1392

1950,Parental Reflective Functioning Affects Sensitivity to Distress in Mothers with Postpartum Depression,"Parental reflective functioning (PRF) refers to the capacity of caregivers to reflect upon their children's internal mental states and intentions, which is seen as crucial for parental sensitivity, defined as the adequate behavioral response to an infant's signals. In this study, the effect of maternal PRF on sensitivity during the mother-infant interaction was examined in a clinical sample of 50 mothers who were experiencing postpartum depression and their infants aged three to 10 months. Mother and infant were exposed to emotional distress using the still-face procedure. It was hypothesized that low levels of PRF are associated with a decrease in maternal sensitivity in response to distress. Maternal PRF was assessed using the parental reflective functioning questionnaire (PRF). The subscales measured interest and curiosity in mental states, certainty about mental states (i.e., the recognition of the opacity of mental states), and pre-mentalizing modes (i.e., non-mentalizing modes), whereas sensitivity was evaluated using the maternal behavior Q-sort (Mini-MBQS-V). The results revealed a significant overall decrease in maternal sensitivity. As expected, the higher the scores on the pre-mentalizing modes, which indicated low levels of mentalizing through the mothers' repudiation or defense against it, the greater the decreases in sensitivity. No effects with respect to the interest and curiosity in mental states or the certainty about mental states were found. Our findings determined that the pre-mentalizing modes are predictive of sensitivity to distress in mothers with postpartum depression.","Krink, Stephanie and Muehlhan, Christine and Luyten, Patrick and Romer, Georg and Ramsauer, Brigitte",0,10.1007/s10826-017-1000-5,1394
1951,"The prevalence, correlates and reasons for using electronic cigarettes among New Zealand adults","Introduction: There is strong interest in the use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) globally. This paper is the first to report population-based data on ever-use and current use of e-cigarettes among New Zealand adults. The paper also extends previous international studies by exploring the reasons for trying e-cigarettes, ever users' recall of brand(s) they have ever tried, and current users' recall of their current brand. Methods: The Health and Lifestyles Survey (HIS) is a biennial face-to-face in-house survey of New Zealand adults aged 15 years or over. In 2014, 2594 participants completed the survey. Results: Ever-use and current use of e-cigarettes were 13.1% and 0.8% respectively. Tobacco smoking status predicted the use of e-cigarettes, with current smokers reporting the highest rate of use (50% ever-use and 4% current use). Among current smokers who had tried an e-cigarette, curiosity (49%) and desire to quit smoking (37%) were the most common reasons for trying. About half of the ever-users could not name any of the brand(s) they had ever tried, and one-fifth of current users could not name their current brand, Conclusions: Compared with other countries, New Zealand has a high rate of ever-use. Among current smokers, one in two had tried an e-cigarette. However, progression to regular use appears to be rare. The finding that 18% of current e-cigarette users could not name their current brand highlights the importance of investigating users' knowledge of e-cigarettes in general and assessing the factors that influence brand choice such as advertising, price, and accessibility.

1953,Toward a Liberal Education in Medicine,"The central thesis of Abraham Flexner's analyses of North American and European medical education was that the university is essential to the provision of a medical education. The authors invoke the spirit of Flexner to envision further contributions of the university at large to undergraduate medical education. Medical curricula now include elements of a variety of other disciplines that are better represented in other parts of the university. Most schools, however, even those closely affiliated with a comprehensive university, do not take full advantage of these resources, nor do they offer sufficient opportunities for students to pursue individualized interests and learning goals. Medical school now plays a different role in the education of physicians than it did a century ago-it remains the definitive, but is no longer the ultimate, stage in a continuum involving college, professional, postgraduate, and continuing education. The authors explore the medical school years as an opportunity for a liberal education in medicine. Beyond the assurance of competence in core knowledge, skills, and perspectives, this model places more emphasis on nurturing students' intellectual curiosity about phenomena of illness and disease, their understanding of the human condition, and their exploration of the many other disciplines related to medicine and the life sciences. A richer, broader education can be achieved through more flexible and individualized paths to the MD and facilitated by realizing medical schools' full academic citizenship in the university.

1954,"Essays on Agricultural, Financial Economics and Education","This dissertation is devoted to the study of three different topics under the advice of three different mayor professors. The only thing these topics have in common is the interest and curiosity of the author to explain real life events, using applied econometric techniques. Chapter 2 applies financial tools to assess whether stock values reacted across world markets to the announcement of indexes that synthesize the environmental performance of the world's largest publicly-traded companies. The environmental index selected for this purpose is the ""Global 100 Ranking"" (G100), a ranking of the 100 largest public companies by market capitalization. The results show that the market reacted to the ""Global 100 Ranking"" by changing the relative price of the stocks, but not the value of the portfolio. We also find that investors in US-traded stocks are more interested in past environmental performance than on managerial quality, while the opposite is true for investors in non-US-traded stocks. Chapter 3 estimates simultaneous equation models of barge and railroad rates for specific origin-destinations and grains (corn, wheat, and soybeans) in the US, using data from the Grain Transportation Report. Evidence of specific route competitiveness of various grains was found. Interestingly, it was possible to identify a railroad route with prices as complementary of barge rates, which may increase railroad market power. River levels affect barge rates, but there are differences for corn and wheat, possibly due to production locations in the Mississippi basin. Ocean vessel rates affect barge rates directly and railroad rates indirectly. Real exchange rates affect barge rates more than railroad rates. Evidence suggests that distance between railroad origin and barge origin affects the impact of the later on the first one. Chapter 4 studies the effect on early education achievement of keeping the same classmates as in the previous year by utilizing the unique nature of the Tennessee Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR). Results show that keeping all kindergarten classmates vs. losing all of them increases the probability of passing first grade by 7 to 10 percent. In addition, noncognitive skills are improved when more kindergarten classmates are kept as first grade classmates. If all classmates are kept together vs. staying alone in a new class, motivation and selfconfidence may increase by 0.5 of a standard deviation, while the number of absences may decrease by 2 to 3 days.

1955,"The Hemshin: History, society and identity in the highlands of northeast Turkey","The Hemshin are without doubt one of the most enigmatic peoples of Turkey and the Caucasus. As former Christians who converted to Islam centuries ago yet did not assimilate into the culture of the surrounding Muslim populations, as Turks who speak Armenian yet are often not aware of it, as Muslims who continue to celebrate feasts that are part of the calendar of the Armenian Church, and as descendants of Armenians who, for the most part, have chosen to deny their Armenian origins in favour of recently invented myths of Turkic ancestry, the Hemshin and the seemingly irreconcilable differences within their group identity have generated curiosity and often controversy. The Hemshin is the first scholarly work to provide an in-depth study of these people living in the eastern Black Sea region of Turkey. This groundbreaking volume brings together chapters written by an international group of scholars that cover the history, language, economy, culture and identity of the Hemshin. It is further enriched with an unprecedented collection of maps, pictures and appendices of up-to-date statistics. The Hemshin forms part of the Peoples of the Caucasus series, an indispensable and yet accessible resource for all those with an interest in the Caucasus. <c2><a9> 2007 Editorial matter and selection, Hovann H.

Results indicate that college students were more mature in their career choices, intellectual interests, and psychological activity than high school students. Ignorance was considered by most Ss to be a personality problem and was generally defined as the inability to express an idea or as a deficiency in memory or lack of interest and curiosity. Causes of ignorance included lack of interest and time as well as difficulty in grasping scientific terminology. It was also found that ignorance can be reduced through the use of mass media, literature, and improvement in public education and that the feeling of ignorance is most often accompanied by guilt and self-defense.

1957,Suggestion and Expectancy in Emotional Socialization,"Building on previous research indicating that among first, third, and fifth graders, older children expect affective expressive behavior to be regulated, a study was made of children's beliefs about rationales for and consequences of regulated affective expressive behavior. Children's beliefs were examined in conjunction with their parents' (1) attitudes towards children's expressive behavior, (2) perception of their own self-monitoring, and (3) perception of their families'""social climate."" Participants were 32 children in grades 2, 5, and 8 from an urban West Coast parochial school and their parents. Children were individually interviewed using as stimuli four photographed scenarios of children involved in conflicts in which the target child in the scenario could respond with a facial expression that was discrepant from internal affect. Two questions posed referred to the scenarios and a third referred to the child's belief about his or her own emotional experiences. Parents individually responded to an author-developed questionnaire, the Parent Attitude toward Child Expressiveness Scale (PACES); to Snyder's Self-Monitoring Scale (SMS); and to Moo's Family Environment Scale (FES). Affective expressive behavior sampled in PACES includes anger, distress, fear, anxiety or nervousness, interest or curiosity, happiness, and disgust. Data were analyzed by stepwise regression analyses for each child variable: 11 predictor variables were entered in the equation. Results are discussed and a schematic model of the developmental differentiation of emotional experience is appended. (RH)","Saarni, Carolyn",0,,1400
1958,The Garden Wonder Wall: Fostering wonder and curiosity on multi-day garden field trips,"Field trips to the Michigan 4-H Children's Garden must provide rich science learning experiences for students and teachers. A key to this is getting students to ask questions. To facilitate student question asking we developed the Wonder Wall, a ""wall"" where students could write their questions. Student questions were answered as part of the field trip and written answers were provided following the field trip. Nearly 75% of the 455 2nd and 3rd grade students in this study posted questions. Questions were both basic information (50%) and wonderment (50%). Basic information questions were simple questions that focused on the garden, plants, staff, and field trip activities. Wonderment questions were more complex questions that focused on field trip learning activities. The 50% wonderment questions was greater than expected, suggesting that students posted these questions after carefully thinking about what they had learned. Student questions provided a real-time assessment of student understanding and interests. Wonderment questions could easily be extended into an experiment, giving students the opportunity to direct their own learning. The Wonder Wall is a simple, easily integrated tool that engaged students in asking questions. It provided educators with valuable insights into student understanding and interests. The Wonder Wall was a powerful part of our field trips and we recommend incorporating it into field trips where ever possible.","Driscoll, E A and Lownds, N K",0,10.1080/15330150701319412,1401

1965,Understanding the Art of Islam,"Since September 11, 2001, the interest in learning more about Islam, Muslims, and Islamic culture and society has expanded in a variety of ways. The purpose of this brief narrative is to create a sense of curiosity and anticipation to learning more about how Islamic art contributes to the art world. In this article, the author describes a unit that is made up of two weeks of lesson outlines designed for art teachers who wish to take a multicultural interdisciplinary path. The first lesson is an exploratory exercise in which students write down their knowledge of, thoughts about, and any other fact or fiction they may have heard or seen regarding Islamic culture. In the second lesson, the author introduces the concepts of the religious and sacred, both of which are closely related to calligraphy. The purpose of this unit is to provide a guideline on how to teach about a culture that is unfamiliar to students and perhaps to the teacher. With this article, the author hopes to help dispel stereotypes about Islam and, more importantly, enable art teachers to teach about Islamic art on an interdisciplinary platform.

1966,Technology and English studies: Innovative Professional Paths,"In scholarship about technology and English studies, there are a number of first-person narratives that suggest what may be termed ""traditional"" professional paths. That is, they chronicle the positive influence of a particular technology, class, professor, or publication, and suggest that it inspired a distinct and rewarding professional path. What is missing is the rest of the story--alternate ways that individuals have come to do work in technology and English studies and analysis of what this means for paths others might pursue. Technology and English Studies: Innovative Professional Paths meets this need. The volume begins with definitions of its three central terms: technology, English Studies, and professional paths. Chapters are organized in four sections, reflecting both a chronological progression and thematic professional development: ""The Past as the Future""; ""Searching the Academy""; ""Pushing Boundaries""; and ""Forging Beyond."" As a forerunner in addressing professionalization across the domains that comprise technology and English studies, it will prove foundational for many readers with non-traditional or otherwise alternate backgrounds who are working out what professional paths might be available to them. Technology and English Studies: Innovative Professional Paths is an important professional development resource for professors, instructors, and graduate students across the field of English studies, including rhetoric and composition, computers and writing, computer-assisted language learning, literary and linguistic computing, literary studies, English education, technical communication, linguistics, writing centers, second-language education/ESL, and creative writing.

1975,How Can We Motivate High School Students to Study Science?,"The main goals of this study were to find why some students in the 10th grade do not choose to major in any of the science disciplines, and how to arouse their interest in science. The assumption was that the way students perceive and evaluate their acquaintance with any kind of knowledge was very important in their learning process. If students were not interested in science, they would tend not to make an effort to learn and understand the meaning of concepts that were being taught to them. It was shown that the most effective factor contributing to students' decision to study science was their interest in the subject. We developed questionnaires, and disseminated it among 10th grade students, all between 15 and 16 years old, from three high schools located in the central part of Israel, among middle to upper socioeconomic homes. Based on the findings we concluded: (1) Despite the fact that 10th grade students studied science for three years in junior high school, many of them were unfamiliar with basic concepts that appeared in the science syllabus, and (2) the degree of interest shown by students in a given subject was greater when they were familiar with the subject and thus wished to hear and know more about it. Therefore, students' exposure to various scientific subjects can be expected to induce them to show more interest, arouse their curiosity and enhance their desire to know more. Following these results, we attempted to use a historical approach to science teaching, with the belief that it would improve the attitudes and interest of non-science-oriented students (those who did not choose to major in any of the scientific disciplines) towards science and science studies.

1976,A Framework for Teaching Epistemic Insight in Schools,"This paper gives the rationale and a draft outline for a framework for education to teach epistemic insight into schools in England. The motivation to research and propose a strategy to teach and assess epistemic insight followed research that investigated how students and teachers in primary and secondary schools respond to big questions about the nature of reality and human personhood. The research revealed that there are pressures in schools that dampen students' expressed curiosity in these types of questions and limit their developing epistemic insight into how science, religion and the wider humanities relate. These findings prompted the construction of a framework for education for students aged 5-16 designed to encourage students' expressed interest in big questions and develop their understanding of the ways that science interacts with other ways of knowing. The centrepiece of the framework is a sequence of learning objectives for epistemic insight, organised into three categories. The categories are, firstly, the nature of science in real world contexts and multidisciplinary arenas; secondly, ways of knowing and how they interact; and thirdly, the relationships between science and religion. Our current version of the Framework is constructed to respond to the way that teaching is organised in England. The key principles and many of the activities could be adopted and tailored to work in many other countries.","Billingsley, Berry and Nassaji, Mehdi and Fraser, Sharon and Lawson, Finley",0,10.1007/s11165-018-9788-6,1411
1977,In what we tend to feel is without history: Toward a feminist ethics of affect,"My project begins from the need for ethics to speak to the messy, relational space between freedom and determinism through which histories persists in us. I bring together Spinoza's ethics and politics of affect, Foucault's genealogies of 'abnormals' (and the will to know them), and Butler's response ethics to develop a language for these affective mediations-scripts, fictions, frames-and to consider how such an understanding of affect could enrich and concretize a response ethics: beyond the call to respond to another sentient being in its 'otherness,' its overflow of what we could conceptualize or thematize, an 'ethics of affect' addresses the concrete and historically singular ways in which we approach this unbridgeable gap. I am particularly concerned with 'interest,' and with sympathy and curiosity as modes of interest in the lives of others, because these modes negotiate forms of identification, difference, and spectacle that animate this gap. My aim is to develop terms to help us to articulate and counteract the persistence of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and other stuck cultural patterns of association which delimit what it is possible to think and feel.

Thus, abilities such as research curiosity, research talent, defining, analyzing and solving questions come to the forefront. The purpose of the study is analyzing the relations between students' academic motivation, research concerns and research competency levels in terms of various variables in the sample of Erciyes University. Screening model was used in the study. 727 senior class students from 13 faculties and 1 vocational high school participated in the study. Personal information form, academic motivation scale, research concern scale and research competency scale were used in the study as data collection tools. In data analysis, descriptive technics such as percentage, frequency and mean were used. Also, Pearson correlation coefficient was used to define relations between variables and T-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to reveal differentiations. Differences between groups were defined by Tukey test. Multiple regression analysis was used to define to what extent students' academic motivation and research concerns affect their research competency. In short, results of the study as follows: 1. Students feel themselves ready for scientific studies with regard to academic motivation. However, proportion of the ones who are indecisive and do not feel ready is quite high; 2. Students state that they are not sure whether they have sufficient research concerns or not; 3. Students state that they have sufficient research competency; 4. It was found out that students' academic motivation, research concern and competency scores did not differ according to their gender but they differed according to their faculties, departments, grade-point average and their level of satisfaction from departments; 5. It was found out that students' academic motivation, research concern and competency scores differed according to their status of taking scientific research methods course before. The ones taking the course before had significantly higher scores; 6. It was found out that 13 % of students' academic competency was determined by academic motivation and research concern. Following suggestions can be made according to results: 1. Events such as symposiums, panels and congresses can be organized to increase students' interest in doing scientific researches; 2. Studies should be done to define reasons of differentiation of students' academic motivation, research concerns and research competency levels according to their academic success, faculties and departments; 3. Courses such as scientific research, assessment and evaluation and statistics should be varied and put in the curriculums.","Durmus<c3><a7>elebi, Mustafa and Durmu<c5><9f><c3><a7>elebi, M",0,10.13189/ujer.2018.061008,1413

In the effort to help address this issue, this study investigated the effects of the implementation of robots in an elementary-level Korean math class, examining student cognitive and affective domains before, immediately after, and three months after treatment. The participants in this study were 121 fourth graders (11 to 12 years old) who randomly selected from four classes, and then randomly assigned to either the ""Robot"" group (58 children) or the ""Ruler & Protractor"" group (63 children). The findings from this study were that concerning student achievement in the cognitive domain, no statistically significant result was found. As for the affective domain, after treatment, the Robot group's levels of interest and curiosity toward mathematics and participation in their mathematics class were statistically higher than those of the Ruler & Protractor group. This remained true at the delayed posttest. A correlation analysis between achievements in cognitive domain, results of the observation test during class, and results of the self-assessment test in affective domain showed that in the case of the Ruler & Protractor group, their instruction in mathematics class only contributed to cognitive domain. However, in the case of the Robot group, treatment contributed to both cognitive and affective domains. In conclusion, robots have potential to replace traditional ruler and protractor use in geometry education from the perspective of their effects on cognitive and affective domains.","Kim, S and Lee, C",0,,1415
1983,I Want To Know...? Learning about Science,"Noting that children's questions are usually complex and thereby provide a natural learning context for inquiry-based early childhood education, this booklet focuses on using children's scientific questions as a foundation for planning and creating a stimulating learning environment. Following an introduction, the booklet provides suggestions for supporting children's curiosity by encouraging them to ask questions in their daycare, preschool, or early elementary school environment. Sample child questions are listed with suggested ways for investigating the questions. Information on question-asking by adults includes suggestions for shaping queries to reflect genuine interest and using questions for different purposes. A case study related to children's questions about bees in the garden illustrates how authentic questions can be used as the basis for planning learning experiences, with each question paired with a learning experience to provide an answer. The use of children's questions for planning science educational experiences is explained within the context of an interactive approach to science instruction, growing out of research into children's understanding of a range of science concepts. The teacher's roles in the interactive approach are examined and include monitoring children's interests in the world, recording their ideas and questions, facilitating their investigations, and providing resources. The booklet concludes by noting that following up on children's questions provides them with the opportunity to experience the thrill of working like a real scientist, investigating what matters to them and what is directly related to their world.

1994,Story Structure and Reader Affect in American and Hungarian Short Stories. Technical Report No. 375,"Forty-eight college students participated in a study that (1) explored the degree to which the reader response technique developed by W. F. Brewer and E. H. Lichtenstein to study artificial texts could be applied to natural texts, and (2) compared texts written over a wide time period and from two different literary traditions (six American and six Hungarian short stories written in two different time periods). The stories were divided into five roughly equal parts. After reading each part, subjects completed affective reader response scales that measured suspense, curiosity about the past, curiosity about the future, surprise, and irony. After reading the entire story, the subjects completed a questionnaire dealing with such issues as overall liking, degree of completeness, and degree of empathy. The overall pattern of results provided support for Brewer and Lichtenstein's structural-affect theory and showed that the reader response technique they developed for use with artifical texts could be used for natural texts. In addition, suspense and empathy were found to be particularly important variables in producing story liking for both American and Hungarian stories, and there were few differences in findings between the older stories and the more recent ones. (Appendixes contain a list of the stories and copies of the scales used in the study.) (FL)","Brewer, William F and Ohtsuka, Keisuke and Illinois Univ., Urbana.

1996,Proactive Guidance in Computer-Assisted Language Learning,"A discussion of computer-assisted language learning focuses on management of individual learning processes. As distinct from a reference package, a computer-assisted teaching program has to assure that the student acquires and retains the complete information in the most efficient way, provide accurate and useful material, and pique the student's curiosity. One way to arouse student interest is to design multiple links of topics to allow for learner-centered discovery learning. An automatic guidance is needed to manage the learning process. This guidance can appear in two ways. Informational guidance is activated by the learner, presenting the status of learning to help the user make intelligent decisions about what to do next. Proactive or interventional guidance can interrupt the user when he attempts inappropriate steps in the learning process. In language teaching, writing a guidance that considers optimal repetition intervals, especially in a drill section, is a challenging task. It is proposed that in computer-assisted language learning, such guidance be implemented as an event filter. Contains 44 references in English and Chinese.

A clear example of this is the vast scrutiny is cast over the famous composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. What may have started as curiosity, rapidly evolved into extensive research, as the answers about the musician's legendary talent may lie in the details of his life (his childhood, his relationships, his quirks and his mannerisms). It is usually up to historians, anthropologists or philosophers to delve into the pages of old books, trying to grasp answers and clues. However, for some time, Physicians have sought their own part in solving the puzzle. The long told hypothesis regarding Mozart's diagnosis of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome will be examined.

1998,"Does displayed enthusiasm favour recall, intrinsic motivation and time estimation?","Displayed enthusiasm has been shown to relate to intrinsic motivation, vitality, and positive affect, but its effects on recall performance and time estimation have not yet been explored. This research aimed at studying the effects of a delivery style characterised by High Enthusiasm (HE) on recall, time estimation, and intrinsic motivation. In line with previous studies, effects on intrinsic motivation were expected. In addition, higher recall and lower time estimations were hypothesised. In two experiments, participants assigned to a HE condition or to a normal reading control condition listened to a narrative and to a descriptive passage. Then, they were asked to rate perceived time, enthusiasm, pleasure, interest, enjoyment and curiosity, before writing a free recall. Experiment 1 showed that in the HE condition, participants recalled more, were more intrinsically motivated, and expressed lower time estimations compared to the control condition. Experiment 2 confirmed the positive effects of HE reading compared to normal reading, using different passages and a larger sample. <c2><a9> 2015 Taylor & Francis.","MoÃ¨, A",1,10.1080/02699931.2015.1061480,1424
1999,THE REALITY OF INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH APPLIED TO EXPERIMENTAL SCIENTIFIC,"University has as a main objective preparing the students for their future careers and supporting their personal development. In scientific and technical studies this implies training practical skills and problem-based learning. However, we found that the curriculum of these studies (particularly in Spain) does not give sufficient relevance to practical learning. The contents of these studies are mainly theoretical and, in general, far from the R&D activities. According to this problematic in the early 2000's we decided to overcome these mentioned absences and develop an innovative program for laboratory practicum. This program was associated to the subject ``Materials Physics'' within the Physics degree in the University of Valladolid. One of the main objectives was put the students in contact with those industrial activities they could face in their potential future jobs. We introduce the students to real R&D work avoiding conventional teaching/learning. Some of the other peculiar characteristics of the program were: The use of real laboratory equipments similar to the ones used in companies and R&D laboratories. The promotion of teamwork and the development of skills related to both scientific curiosity and the oral defence of their results. Develop self-sufficient skills and support a method for the students to discern and interpret results by themselves. In this program the students, divided in groups, should study a real industrial research query, carrying out a complete characterization of the provided materials to determine the origin of the problem, and proposing a well-founded solution. A detailed description about this program of laboratory practices and tips about its implementation are provided in this proceeding. Several examples of the topics of the practices are also included together with a detailed description of one exemplary practicum. We also analyze the curriculum of the Physics degree at the University of Valladolid and compare it with other national and foreign universities. The realization of this innovative program during more than 10 years has permitted obtaining some interesting conclusions that are presented here. Considerations about the effectiveness of this kind of initiatives are provided taking into account an overall evaluation of the academic progress of the students implied on this innovative learning program; leading to recommendations about the inclusion of this kind of learning programs in scientific and technical studies.","Pinto, Javier and Solorzano, Eusebio and Angel Rodriguez-Perez, Miguel",0,,1425
2000,Influence of literature with familiar characters on the reading activities of competent but reluctant adolescent male readers,"Although reading among boys often diminishes upon entering adolescence, science fiction and fantasy novels along with books based on popular movies have been known to catch boys' interest. Because no researcher has specifically focused on this genre and its influence on adolescent boys' reading activities, the purpose of this study was to address this gap in the literature. The conceptual framework, based on studies showing teen boys select books that entice their imaginations, provide an escape from reality, excitement and physical stimulation to spark their imaginations and create curiosity, guided the study. The research question involved the effect literature with familiar characters had on the reading activities of 14 competent but reluctant, eighth grade males in a single middle school. Reading teachers identified potential participants based on previous test scores, participation in a school reading program, and classroom observations. Data were collected via individual interviews. Hatch's typological process was followed to analyze each transcript individually, then to analyze all transcripts as a whole. Predetermined typologies were: (a) why participants selected particular novels, (b) enjoyment of the novel, (c) perceived reading ability, (d) reading activity since reading the initial selection, and (e) possible future reading activity. Overall, teenage boys found greater pleasure in reading literature with familiar characters than they did in reading novels found in the traditional literary canon. Results of this study may potentially influence both school library collections and curriculum practices in language arts programs. This may create positive social change by increasing the number of adolescent males who choose to read independently for pleasure, decreasing the number of reluctant adolescent male readers, and improving reading test scores and reading skills of adolescent males.

2001,The effects of pre-reading relevance instructions and individual interest on learning outcomes and curiosity,"Epistemic curiosity is a drive that increases arousal and motivates epistemic behavior such as question asking and continued information seeking. According to the knowledge-gap model of curiosity, epistemic curiosity is aroused when a person acknowledges a gap between what they know and what they would like to know. Presenting questions to an individual is theorized to prompt the creation of such knowledge-gaps. In the reading comprehension literature, these questions are called pre-reading relevance instructions. Another variable thought to increase continued epistemic behavior is individual interest. This study aimed to replicate past research by exploring how pre-reading relevance instructions, intended to highlight relevant information, affected reading time and recall. Additionally, it extends past research by examining how pre-reading questions affect further question asking and video watching behavior, and by looking at the effects of individual topic interest on these relationships. One hundred and six students from a Midwest university (41 men and 66 women) read passages about walkingstick insects and were then asked to recall specific and general information about each passage. Participants were also asked if they had additional questions on the subject matter and were given the opportunity to view videos related to the topic. Before reading, participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. In two of these conditions participants received pre-reading relevance instructions and in the final condition participants received general reading instructions. Results for recall were only partially consistent with past research on the effects of relevance instructions. Specifically, in one of the relevance instruction conditions, pre-reading instructions facilitated cued recall. In the other relevance instruction condition, pre-reading instructions facilitated free recall. That is, relevance instructions facilitated cued recall for one passage, but not for the other. Pre-reading relevance instructions did not have any other effects on reading time, recall, or continued epistemic behavior. Individual interest in the domain of walkingsticks did not moderate these relationships. However, individual interest was correlated with continued epistemic behavior. Finally, the limitations and implications of the current research are discussed and ideas for future research are proposed.

2004,"Richard Nixon's ""Pragmatic"" Space Race: Metaphorically Crafting a National Identity","President Richard Nixon decided in 1970 to commission the construction of a fleet of reusable space shuttles. Nixon's rhetoric on the space shuttle program (examined here in the light of Kenneth Burke's theory of symbolic action) shows how a philosophy of pragmatism was crafted out of a philosophy of wonderment. That one cannot now remember Nixon's contribution to the space program is a comment on the type of identification he forged for the program. With sentiment against space exploration running high, the president could no longer argue merely that a program driven by the curiosity that led Columbus to the New World needed no greater justification. With American superiority in space proven, Nixon could also not reasonably speak of the Soviet threat in space. Instead, Nixon used metaphors clustering around such themes as adventure, making investments, setting priorities, and expanding horizons. Nixon's metaphors of contemplation of rather than participation in the shuttle program showed that the program made sense, but also killed interest in the program. As a pragmatic man interested in letting the facts speak for themselves, he created an image of a contemplative person who did little more than think. (Thirty-three notes are included.)

2006,Thinking in sex education: reading prohibition through the film Desire,"This paper argues that sex education must move beyond a focus on compliance so that we may risk the uncertain work of thinking. How might we understand the work of thinking in sex education if we begin from the assumptions that learning is conflicted, that sexuality resists being educated even as it inspires curiosity, and that the subject of sex education is herself divided and liable to act in her own worst interest? Drawing on theories of thinking in psychoanalysis, I consider this question through the status of prohibition in sex education and argue that prohibitions can function either as a way of shutting thinking down or as a tentative step towards thinking an intolerable thought. The documentary film Desire illustrates the potentially productive use of prohibitions and suggests some of the conditions necessary for developing the capacity for thoughtfulness in sex education.","Gilbert, Jen",0,10.1080/14681811.2012.677183,1429
2007,Education in Computational Science: Do Successful Examples Also Create Success in Education?,"This paper is dedicated to improving education in computational science with support of examples from practice based on links from social networks as Twitter and LinkedIn. We have many of successful examples, but the question is what the benefits are for education. The aim is to contribute to improve study results and optimal orientation of students in the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) with regard to practice. The existing controversy creates inconsistency between a successful example in practice and education that is not always successful. The method of solution uses the multidimensional approach, and other sources of information are realised surveys in CRM courses. Achieved results show that examples from practice are adequately supported with suitably verified links to Twitter and LinkedIn. They minimise the number of students with a negative perception of courses. Benefit is good mirroring dynamic changes in IT (information technology) field and diversity of adopted solutions. The challenge is to work with a growing group of passive students and their influence through examples from practice.

2009,The government of God by rewards and punishments,"That which makes the question concerning a future life to be of so great importance to us, is our capacity of happiness and misery. And that which makes the consideration of it to be of so great importance to us, is the supposition of our happiness and misery hereafter depending upon our actions here. Indeed, without this, curiosity could not but sometimes bring a subject, in which we may be so highly interested, to our thoughts; especially upon the mortality of others, or the near prospect of our own. But reasonable men would not take any further thought about hereafter, than what should happen thus occasionally to rise in their minds, if it were certain that our future interest no way depended upon our present behavior; whereas, on the contrary, if there be ground, either from analogy or any thing else, to think it does, then there is reason also for the most active thought and solicitude, to secure that interest; to behave so as that we may escape that misery, and obtain that happiness, in another life, which we not only suppose ourselves capable of, but which we apprehend also is put in our own power. And whether there be ground for this last apprehension, certainly would deserve to be most seriously considered, were there no other proof of a future life and interest, than that presumptive one, which the foregoing observations amount to.

2015,"Competence feedback, task feedback, and intrinsic interest: An examination of process and context","The process by which competence feedback affects intrinsic motivation has not typically been examined in conjunction with effects of other information that may be conveyed in feedback. As such, it is difficult to determine the degree to which the proposed mechanisms are tied to the competence information in feedback. When Sansone (1986, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, 918-931) separated feedback into components satisfying curiosity (task feedback) or signifying competence (positive normative feedback), each enhanced subsequent interest in the task. The present study investigated two possible explanations: whether an insufficiently autonomy-supportive context prevented a stronger relationship between perceived competence and interest and, secondly, whether competence feedback more strongly affected previously identified processes (perceived competence, competence valuation, performance pressure, and perceived autonomy) which have both positive and negative implications for interest. Although positive normative feedback enhanced perceived competence, perceived competence was not related to interest, and this relationship did not change as the degree of autonomy support varied. Furthermore, the results suggest that competence information can affect interest through several processes simultaneously, such that when perceived competence is not relevant, other processes (i.e., competence valuation and perceived autonomy) are. In addition, there may be unique contributions of other kinds of information present in feedback (e.g., task feedback). The implications for process models of intrinsic motivation are discussed. <c2><a9> 1989.","Sansone, C",0,10.1016/0022-1031(89)90027-9,1435
2018,Interest and deprivation factors of epistemic curiosity,"The extent to which two measures of epistemic curiosity (EC), the Epistemic Curiosity Scale (ECS; Litman & Spielberger, 2003) and the curiosity as a Feeling-of-Deprivation Scale (CFDS; Litman & Jimerson, 2004), differentiated between interest (I) and deprivation (D) type curiosity was examined in four studies. In studies 1 (N = 725) and 2 (N = 658), exploratory factor analyses of the ECS and CFDS subscales yielded two factors; the first (I-type) involved pleasure associated with discovering new ideas, while the second (D-type) emphasized spending time and effort to acquire a specific answer or solution. In study 3 (N = 762), confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that a 2-factor model comprised of the I- and D-type curiosity items identified in study 2 had the best fit. In study 4 (N = 515), correlations between revised I- and D-type measures and different learning goals were evaluated. As hypothesized, the I-EC scale correlated with mastery-oriented learning, whereas the D-EC scale was related to failure-avoidance and success-orientation. The results suggest that I-EC is concerned with stimulating positive affect, diversive exploration, learning something completely new and mastery-oriented learning; D-EC involves the reduction of uncertainty, specific exploration, acquiring information that is missing from an existing knowledge set and performance-oriented learning.

(Article 24).[2] With this aim, the innovative goal that arises in this project is the adaptation to the language of signs of different audiovisual materials that are part of the contents of a previous project based on a Virtual Laboratory for the Student pedagogic orientation into Nanotechnology.[3] Therefore, the aim is to abolish communication barriers, not only for deaf people, but also for all hearing impaired and hypohearing impaired people. Within the EU, only three countries and official consideration within its constitution to sign languages, Finland (1995) Portugal (1997) and Austria (2005). In Spain the Sign Language is not officially recognized at the national level, but it is within the scope of some Autonomous Communities, being supported by the European Parliament. The audiovisual materials placed on the Virtual platform, as a virtual laboratory for the nanotechnology understanding, were adapted to be accessible to deaf persons.

2026,The origin and development of ethical problems,"Reflection upon the nature and obligation of morality began as early, or nearly as early, as speculation upon the universe. In fact it is difficult to keep the two modes of thinking apart from each other. Man has as much natural interest in his practical relation to the world or to a Supreme Being, and the limitations which these agencies may impose upon his will as he has curiosity about the causes of things. He will always, therefore, associate reflection upon his conduct with reflection upon the nature of things. In a very large measure what he thinks about his duties, what they are in particular, will be determined by the opinions he maintains about the universe and his destiny in it. Even if he wishes for certain purposes to keep these two phases of thought apart from each other, he will find that he cannot wholly effect this result, but that his ideas of morality are either directly or indirectly molded by his ultimate views about the world and its meaning for him. This tendency very early gave rise to ethical reflection, and even the earliest philosophers, whose opinions it is safe to suppose were not mere myths, are accredited with many wise saws about the duties of man. These proverbs cling to their persons and history as a part of their philosophic opinions, and indicate the same origin for ethical as for metaphysical speculation. But there is not time or space to discuss this matter in a brief outline of its history, and we can only allude to it while characterizing the first period of moral reflection which we have to notice as laying down the line of all subsequent speculations upon moral problems. We may conveniently adopt the usual division of periods into Ancient, Mediasval and Modern. Each of these represents a typical mode of thought, determining the ideals and codes of Ethics applicable to its time.

2027,A Curiosity Model for Artificial Agents,"Curiosity is an inherent characteristic of the animal instinct, which stimulates the need to obtain further knowledge and leads to the exploration of the surrounding environment. In this document we present a computational curiosity model, which aims at simulating that kind of behavior on artificial agents. This model is influenced by the two main curiosity theories defended by psychologists - Curiosity Drive Theory and Optimal Arousal Model. By merging both theories, as well as aspects from other sources, we concluded that curiosity can be defined in terms of the agent's personality, its level of arousal, and the interest of the object of curiosity. The interest factor is defined in terms of the importance of the object of curiosity to the agent's goals, its novelty, and surprise. To assess the performance of the model in practice, we designed a scenario consisting of virtual agents exploring a tile-based world, where objects may exist. The performance of the model in this scenario was evaluated in incremental steps, each one introducing a new component to the model. Furthermore, in addition to empirical evaluation, the model was also subjected to evaluation by human observers. The results obtained from both sources show that our model is able to simulate curiosity on virtual agents and that each of the identified factors has its role in the simulation.","Ribeiro, Eugenio and Ribeiro, Ricardo and de Matos, David Martins",0,,1443
2028,Lessons of Researcher-Teacher Co-design of an Environmental Health Afterschool Club Curriculum,"This paper addresses the impact of teachers' beliefs about argumentation and their community of practice framed views of teaching on co-designing an environmental health afterschool club curriculum with researchers. Our team collaborated with a group of four middle school teachers, asking them to co-design a club that would facilitate (1) students' understanding of environmental health, (2) use of electronic resources, and (3) argumentation skills. The process included researcher-led sessions emphasizing the importance of argumentation to science and teacher-led curriculum design sessions. The qualitative analysis of the meetings and teacher interview transcripts suggests that while teachers viewed argumentation as important, its practice was relegated to the background by the focus on student engagement and perceived logistical and systemic constraints. The paper concludes that in addition to stressing relevance of argumentation to science learning, researchers involved in co-design need to emphasize the potential of argumentation to engage students and to fit into science curriculum. The analysis also reveals teacher-participants' views of environmental health as an important area of middle school education, relevant to students' lives, linkable to the existing curriculum, essential for informed citizenship, and capable of inspiring interest in science. These findings underscore the importance of integrating environmental health into science education and advocating for its inclusion in informal and formal educational settings.","Hundal, Savreen and Levin, Daniel M and Keselman, Alla",0,10.1080/09500693.2013.844377,1444
2030,A brief introduction to Bernard Spilka,"This article presents a brief introduction to Bernard Spilka. Bernard Spilka was born on August 12, 1926, to an Orthodox Jewish family in New York City. His family moved to Long Beach in 1935, where he attended school and began to develop diverse interests such as science, music, and wrestling. In 1943 he completed high school and enrolled in the City College of New York, with an aim toward a major in engineering. He left New York University with a degree in psychology in 1949, and began graduate studies at Purdue University. His master's research focused on group influence on individual judgment. His honors are numerous, from grants received, to the offices held, to the sheer number of publications and literally hundreds of conference presentations. The nook of the bookworm and the field of the rock hound reflect Bernie's diverse interests and represent the totally different environments in which he is comfortable. Bernie has enjoyed being active outdoors in the open spaces but also enjoys sitting quietly with his books. The environments complement each other, each allowing Bernie's curiosity, his interest in collecting, and his competitive nature to thrive.

2031,Adults at 12? Trends in puberty and their public health consequences,"Puberty is a physical preparation for adulthood that, along with bodily changes, promotes interest in sexual activity, increases aggression in adolescents, encourages curiosity and can escalate risk-taking behaviours as people compete for social status and attempt to conform to perceived peer norms. Increasingly, however, as social puberty lags behind physical puberty, the results can be ill-informed health-damaging behaviour. Dissociation of physical and social puberty is also likely to affect certain communities disproportionately. The continued reduction in the age of onset of puberty should not be treated as a biological anomaly. In the long term, public health strategies may attempt to retain the benefits of improved childhood nutrition and reduced infection without necessarily increasing the gap between physical and social puberty.

2033,"COMPUTER GAMES, SELF-ESTEEM AND SCIENCE INTERESTS AMONG INTERMEDIATE","Science education imparts a method of inquiry and systematic way of processing knowledge about the physical world. For this reason, science education provides part of the foundation for any knowledge-based effort to improve health, nutrition, environment, and industry. With rapid development in the science and technology fields, many countries around the world realize that there must be an adequate provision made for science education in order to face challenges in the new millennium. For teachers in the schools, motivating students to learn science and scientific concepts are challenging tasks (Saleh & Khine, 2009). While traditional teaching methods yield good results there are still some low achieving students due to lack of interest and new pedagogy and innovative approaches are needed to elevate the curiosity and scientific habits of mind. Computer games as new media culture have become increasing popular among young people. Today most children play different genre of games at different time depending on their age, maturity and opportunity (Kirriemuir & McFarlane, 2004). They seem to spend considerable amount of time not only in playing games, but also in socializing about games outside of the school hours (Pivec, 2007). Educators believe that the game playing involves complex cognitive skills, real-time decision making, managing resources in critical situations, and problem-solving (Gee, 2003; Khine, 2011). Some researchers advocate that digital games have the potential to provide unique learning experience. This study set to examine the relationship between computer game playing habits and the interest in learning science subjects and the role of self-esteem in promoting scientific habits of mind. No studies are done in this context and the results from this study will be helpful to teachers and school administrators on how to leverage the computer games in learning.","Saleh, I and Khine, M",0,,1447
2034,Big philosophical questions: Why they matter and why they are still around,"Big philosophical questions<e2><80><94>about the mind, the idea of the good, justice, beauty, knowledge<e2><80><94>have been the prime interest of philosophers ever since Plato first raised them in his dialogues. However, regardless of how hard philosophers have been trying to find answers to them, it seems that all they have ever managed to do was to find reasons for disagreements, and, on the whole, to have failed to reach a consensus on pretty much anything. Some philosophers now claim that there hasn<e2><80><99>t been much progress in philosophy, especially when compared to the sciences. I take up this verdict and try to refute it, first by offering an alternative view on what counts as progress, and then by analyzing big philosophical questions and their relevance for our intellectual and practical pursuits. I argue that, due to the distinctive nature of philosophical curiosity, coming up with answers to the big philosophical questions is an ideal that can hardly be met, but that philosophy nevertheless delivers various benefits, intellectual and practical, which the proponents of the No-Progress View tend to ignore. <c2><a9> 2018 International Society for the Study of European Ideas.","Vidmar, I",0,10.1080/10848770.2018.1438872,1448

2038,Review of Michelangelo's finger. An exploration of everyday transcendence,"Reviews the book, Michelangelo's finger: An exploration of everyday transcendence by Raymond Tallis (2010). In Michelangelo's Finger, a non-academic philosophy book written for a non-specialist audience, Britain's foremost gerontologist-cum-philosopher examines the role of the index finger in hominid development. He sees a 'deep symbolic connection between this finger and the special nature of humans' (p. xv), which is illustrated in Michelangelo's depiction of the hand of God reaching out, forefinger extended, to Adam. It is this scene from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel from which Tallis' book takes its name. The function of the human forefinger that is of particular interest to Tallis is its ability to be extended and deployed in communicative pointing. He proposes an explanation of why humans alone can point, and sketches an account of the growth of civilization in which the act of pointing is seed: 'This cognitive universe does not begin with words... [but conceivably] with that family of gestures... whose paradigm example is pointing' (p. 26). It is the ability to point that separates us from our nearest ape ancestors, because pointing requires uniquely human abilities, but in turn permits the discovery of a 'deperspectivalised' objective world. Michelangelo's Finger is not a satisfying book. Good science writing can be clear and precise without being inaccessible, but Tallis' claims are often under-theorised and his knowledge of the empirical studies relevant to his subject is weak. Nonetheless, he is passionate about his subject matter and writes with a contagious sense of intellectual curiosity. This, along with its wealth of interesting ideas, makes for a book that is fun. For all its flaws, I enjoyed grappling with it. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Moore, Richard",0,,1451

2042,"Psychology of creativity: Advances in theory, research and application","Creativity is a topic that has gained increasing interest over the past decades and, unlike other topics which have sudden ""moments of glory"" and then quickly become neglected, it is an issue that continues to attract the attention of researchers and practitioners, overcoming the fluctuating fashions and curiosity of the moment. For this reason, it can be useful to consider periodically what is new about creativity. The aim of this book is to discuss recent developments in the field of creativity. More precisely, attention has been paid to four aspects. Firstly, the concept of creativity changes as a consequence of transformations in the social and cultural environment. Thus, the way creativity is meant needs to be always updated by referring it to new requests and goals. Secondly, new theoretical constructs are proposed or unsuspected links between creativity and other notions are explored, so as to revise the old concepts. Thirdly, new research methods and instruments are devised and investigators have new opportunities to shed light on further aspects of creativity. Finally, both researchers and professionals discover new fields where creativity can be cultivated and trained, broadening the range of possible applications. A variety of subjects are addressed by following different approaches and by considering different aspects of creativity. Hopefully this should allow readers to have an updated view of what is currently debated and investigated in the field of theory and research about the psychological processes involved in creativity. <c2><a9> 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

2043,Intellect and individuality,"On empirical and theoretical grounds, it is proposed that an inquiring intellect contributes to people individuality, that is, to creatively construing and presenting the self as unlike others. This research used photo essays about the self as the medium for operationalizing self-construals that are unlike others (i.e., are uniquely creative, abstract, self-reflective, and multidimensional). Two studies (N = 591) are reported in which individuality, rated from photo essays, was related to a variety of markers for an interest in ideas. First, in a new analysis of previously published data, we related individuality to the Clark-Trow typology of major college student philosophies. As expected, students who endorsed an intellectual philosophy of attending college, relative to those endorsing the vocational philosophy, showed greater individuality. Second, in 2 new samples, individuality was predicted and found to correlate with the intellectual philosophy of college as well as intellectual openness, investigative vocational interests, need for cognition, and trait curiosity. Qualitative analyses of photo essays by the participants with the highest and lowest inquiring intellect helped articulate these differences. Findings bear on the openness versus intellect controversy among ``big five'' researchers and suggest that self-creativity is related to both aesthetically open and intellectual orientations.","Dollinger, S J and Ross, V J and Preston, L A",0,10.1207/S15326934CRJ1402_8,1454

We argue that links to specific dates can trigger curiosity, increase retention and guide visitors around the venue following new appealing narratives in subsequent visits. The proposal has been evaluated in a pilot study on the collection of the Archaeological Museum of Tripoli (Greece), for which a team of humanities experts wrote a set of diverse narratives about the exhibits. A year-round calendar was crafted so that certain narratives would be more or less relevant on any given day. Expanding on this calendar, personalised recommendations can be made by sorting out those relevant narratives according to personal events and interests recorded in the profiles of the target users. Evaluation of the associations by experts and potential museum visitors shows that the proposed approach can discover meaningful connections, while many others that are more incidental can still contribute to the intended cognitive phenomena.","Dahroug, Ahmed and Vlachidis, Andreas and Liapis, Antonios and Bikakis, Antonis and L<c3><b3>pez-Nores, Mart<c3><ad>n and Sacco, Owen and Pazos-Arias, Jos<c3><a9> Juan",0,10.1177/0165551519871823,1455
2045,Children want to understand the world beyond the here and now,"The children whom we studied were actively striving to understand the people, the events, and the natural phenomena which constitute their world. Early childhood has long been recognized as a period when children evidence great interest in, and curiosity about, those things which exist in their immediate environment. Providing opportunities for young children to explore their environment in order to satisfy this curiosity is an essential element in their education. For very young children the home or the nursery school holds, for a time, all that is needed for challenging, interesting exploration and learning. Finding their way about, mastering the routines of daily living, learning the uses of things, establishing social relationships, and recreating in play the experiences they have already had are all-consuming interests. These kinds of experiences serve to orient them to life in the world of reality. Soon, however, very soon indeed for today's children, their interests begin to expand beyond these narrow confines to the outside world. Natural phenomena are appealing. People and events outside the home and school offer challenges to their powers of understanding and comprehension. These things are all part of a complex world. To many people this is a world much too complex for young children to understand. The aim in working with young children has always been to simplify life for them. This has been done by limiting exploration to those things which they can see and which lend themselves to firsthand manipulation or exploration. The principle of the here and now as defining the world of interest and study for young children grew out of this concept. A careful look at young children today, however, raises questions about the adequacy of the here and now concept as a means of defining content of educational experiences for young children. Today's children feel the impact on their lives of events in all parts of the world and even the universe. In a sense, the faraway and long ago have become the here and now for young children today. The children in this study demonstrated this fact. They were concerned with ideas and things far removed from their immediate environment as well as with ideas and things which they encountered daily in their own surroundings. Contrary to the popular notion these children were intensely interested and highly motivated to explore the faraway and long ago through play and conversation.

2048,Re-intermediation in the Republic of Science: Moving from intellectual property to intellectual commons,"Public research is largely an open, communitarian, and cooperative system. It is founded on freedom of inquiry, sharing of data, and full disclosure of results by scientists whose motivations are rooted primarily in intellectual curiosity, the desire to influence the thinking of others about the natural world, peer recognition for their achievements, and promotion of the public interest. Although this normative and value structure of public science predated the revolution in digitally networked technologies, it makes it ideally suited to experiment with and exploit those new technological capabilities, which themselves facilitate open, distributed, and cooperative uses of information. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the emergence and early institutionalization of many new paradigms of virtual knowledge-based communities and related information activities have occurred in public science. Examples include open journals, open archives, federated data management networks, community-based open peer review, collaboratories for virtual experiments, and virtual observatories, among others. Taken together, these emerging capabilities represent aspects of a broader trend toward both formal and informal peer production of information in a highly distributed, volunteer, and open environment. Such activities are based on principles that may be more accurately characterized as intellectual commons, rather than intellectual property, and that reflect the communitarian ethos of the republic of science. This presentation will describe several new models of information production, management, and dissemination in public science, and analyze some of the key factors and conditions for their success.","Uhlir, P F",0,10.3233/ISU-2003-232-304,1457
2049,The Five-Dimensional Curiosity Scale Revised (5DCR): Briefer subscales while separating overt and covert social curiosity,"Curiosity is a fundamental human motivation that influences learning, the acquisition of knowledge, and life fulfillment. Our ability to understand the benefits (and costs) of being a curious person hinges on adequate assessment. Synthesizing decades of prior research, our goal was to improve a well-validated, multi-dimensional measure of curiosity (Kashdan et al., 2018). First, we sought to distinguish between two types of social curiosity: the overt desire to learn from other people versus covert, surreptitious interest in what other people say and do. Second, we sought to remove weaker items and reduce the length of each subscale. Using data from a survey of 483 working adults (Study 1) and 460 community adults (Study 2), we found evidence to support the preexisting four dimensions of curiosity (Joyous Exploration, Deprivation Sensitivity, Stress Tolerance, and Thrill Seeking) along with the separation of the fifth dimension into Overt Social Curiosity and Covert Social Curiosity. Each factor of the Five-Dimensional Curiosity Scale Revised (5DCR) had substantive relations with a battery of personality (e.g., Big Five, intellectual humility) and well-being (e.g., psychological need satisfaction) measures. With greater bandwidth and predictive power, the 5DCR offers new opportunities for basic research and the evaluation of curiosity enhancing interventions.","Kashdan, Todd B. and Disabato, David J and Goodman, Fallon R and McKnight, Patrick E",0,10.1016/j.paid.2020.109836,1458
2050,An attention model for museum exhibits: A study of motivation to pay attention by free-choice learners in informal learning environments,"Human attention and its motivational prerequisites receive a great deal of scrutiny in formal education but have not been the subject of comprehensive research in informal learning settings, such as museums. Even researchers who study formal settings use terms such as attention, interest, and curiosity interchangeably, or at least imprecisely. Based on research in varied fields such as attention, interest, relevance, and reading, I formed a theoretical model for use in informal learning settings which I call, The Attention Model for Museum Exhibits. The purpose of this study was to identify those factors that motivate free-choice learners acting in informal learning environments to pay attention. These factors comprise an Attention Model for Museum Exhibits. A further purpose was to substantiate that the attention model was applicable to visitors across multiple exhibits. I observed and interviewed forty-six groups of museum visitors to test the theoretical model. These visitors came from two studies that I conducted, one in 1998 and the other in 1999. They visited one of four exhibits from one of three institutions: The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan; The Detroit Institute of Arts in Detroit, Michigan; and the Michigan State University Museum in East Lansing. I used theoretical (or purposive) sampling in order to generalize to theory and selected groups to the point of redundancy to ensure saturation. The findings from this pair of studies support the choice of Interest and Relevance as categories for the factors that describe the dynamics of attention on the part of free-choice learners. The factors within each category, i.e., Enduring Personal Interest, Situation-Specific Interest, Curiosity, Personal History, and Group Influence, were able to describe the dynamics of the motivation to attend for the visitors who participated in this study. Further, the findings show that the attention model applied to visiting groups across the four exhibits and three institutions that were included in this study. The Attention Model as proposed and refined by this study may be a viable theoretical tool in describing motivation in informal settings. The Attention Model has potential for guiding practice as well as further inquiry. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Lightner, John William",0,,1459
2052,Parent-child relationships: Report from the Fels Research Institute,"Before describing specific projects completed or under way at the Fels Institute, the author presents a brief picture of the group of families who are being studied and the general nature of the research program. The Institute was created, some twenty years or so ago, as a longitudinal, interdisciplinary study of human development. The intent was to study the same individuals from prenatal life to maturity, various aspects of physical growth and personality development being appraised by appropriate scientific methodologies. There are about 125 families currently participating in the project. The battery of ratings is composed of thirty scales, ranging from global, all-inclusive judgments, as ""adjustment of the home,"" to specific variables such as ""restrictiveness of regulations,"" and ""intensity of contact with the child"". Intercorrelations reveal that five of the scales, ""child-centeredness of the home,"" ""approval,"" ""acceptance,"" ""affectionateness"" and ""rapport between parent and child,"" are closely interrelated, forming a cluster which measures what we have called the warmth of the parent-child relationship. In one study, results showed that the activity level of the home, that is, the amount of parent-child interaction, acceleration, and so on, served to differentiate two kinds of democratic homes. The child coming from the ""active"" democratic home showed more competitiveness, aggressiveness, curiosity and impatience, together with greater emotional excitability, than did the child from the more passive, laissez-faire kind of democratic environment. Another project is described in which an attempt was made to define some of the intrafamily differences in parent-child relationships. The relationship of personality dynamics to observed behavior is another major area of interest. Vaughn Crandall has undertaken a research in which three projective tests, the Rorschach, the Thematic Apperception Test, and the Rotter Incomplete Sentences Test, are being administered to each of a group of mothers. Under the leadership of Lester W. Sontag, director of the Institute, a prime focus of current research effort is the study of the resolution of infantile dependent needs.

2056,"Exploring the Functions, Correlates, and Consequences of Interest and Curiosity","Reviews the book, Exploring the Psychology of Interest by P. J. Silvia (see record 2006-03939-000). In fewer than 200 pages of text, Paul J. Silvia provides the reader with a compelling theoretical and empirical rationale for the importance of interest in the study of emotion, personality, motivation, education, careers, and vocations, and thus in nearly every area of human activity. There are three basic reasons why Silvia's book should catalyze a critical mass of attention to the study of interest. First, there is an ambitious review of theory and research, from Dewey's (1913) musings on the interrelations among interest, perceived competence, and learning to ""in press"" empirical studies on how interest can be understood in the context of emotion and appraisal theories. Second, in an attempt to address ongoing controversies and lingering questions, Silvia provides a substantial amount of evidence from contemporary research on emotion and appraisals to further a model on the structure of momentary states of interest and enduring interests. Third, to complement the review of nearly a century of work on interest, the proposals, methods, and conclusions by authors are not accepted at face value. Rather, they are challenged and, in many cases, reinterpreted. This book is relevant to not only researchers and clinicians currently concentrating on the topics of interest, curiosity, and intrinsic motivation but anyone interested in emotion, personality, and motivation. Although scientists make up the primary audience for this book, the clear and coherent writing style transforms potentially complex topics into easily digestible material. Thus, this book can be read and appreciated by anyone with a minor background in psychology (including undergraduate college students, educators, and allied health professionals). Moreover, with the recent surge of interest in the positive spectrum of psychological functioning (""positive psychology""), Exploring the Psychology of Interest offers insight into a psychological state, dispositional tendency, and set of activities that arguably reflect some of the most positive, engaging, and meaningful aspects of human nature. This book provides a convincing case for a more inclusionary status of interest in the study and treatment of human behavior.

2057,Assessment of cultural competence: Validation of the inventory ICC,"The global dimension of the contemporary world has led to an increase of the migration and contact between people of different nations and cultural backgrounds. While globalization has facilitated contact it also generated unrest among the various actors as a result of the conflict between systems of values, beliefs and customs. Different groups of migrants must face the daily challenge of trying to understand the language spoken by members of the host culture, interact with different people in a context of prevailing values, traditions and customs other than their own. International students, expatriates leaders, diplomats, soldiers serving on peacekeeping missions must adapt effectively to the host culture and succeed in their assigned task. Migrant populations are called temporary residents (sojourners) because they are people who migrate to a different cultural context for a relatively long time (6 months to 5 years) to perform a certain task bringing into play the skills of socio-cultural adaptation, which is defined as cultural competence. These skills are central to the effective performance of temporary residents who have to perform tasks in a different setting other than their own. There are a number of psychological instruments that predict the effective adaptation of the sojourners to a culturally diverse environment, evaluating specific traits that predict success or the global competence itself in a direct way. This study is part of the evaluation of cultural competence related to more stable traits linked to personality traits. This study aimed to design and validate a Spanish-language inventory (Inventory of Cultural Competence, ICC) to assess the dimensions of intercultural contact relevant to socio-cultural and psychological adaptation of temporary residents (sojourners). It was based in a previous inventory: IAC (Inventory of Cultural Adaptation, Castro Solano, 2011) consisting of three dimensions. The final version of the ICC consisted of five dimensions (three belonged to the IAC: Openness to New Experiences, Autonomy and Independence, Acceptance of Cultural Diversify and two were included in this study: Emotional Instability and Relationships). 334 subjects participated of this study (150 male and 184 female) who had an average of 33.86 years (SD = 13.84). All of them were residents of the City of Buenos Aires (n = 228, 68%) and the suburbs (n = 106, 32%). The results support the conclusion that the ICC has satisfactory psychometric properties (reliability and validity). We could verify evidences of internal validity. The ICC was composed of five dimensions. Of the eight original scales proposed for the ICC analysis only five could be retained in the final analysis. Regarding external validity, the ICC has evidence of convergent validity with the BFI (Big Five Inventory), with the CAO (Questionnaire Openness to Others) and the SWLS (Satisfaction With Life Scale). The results suggested that in the background underlies a unique dimension related to the degree of interest and willingness to get in contact with groups of different cultural backgrounds, called for some authors multicultural strength (Powers & Davidov, 2006). Bennett and Bennett (2004) called this competence cultural sensitivity (cultural mindset) and it was considered the awareness that your values are different from the host cultural group. This representational domain includes attitudes such as curiosity about diversity and tolerance of ambiguity.

Methods to measure the construct of ``interest'' in the context of environmental education have the potential to enhance program evaluation practices yet remain underdeveloped. Therefore, we investigated how situational interest was triggered among participants in an environmental education day camp and tested two participant-driven tools for exploring interest within this setting: digital photography and journaling. Findings suggest that several key domains of interest might be revealed by using photography and journaling concurrently and/or independently as evaluation tools.

2063,Holographic Optical Data Storage,"Although the basic idea may be traced back to the earlier X-ray diffraction studies of Sir W. L. Bragg, the holographic method as we know it was invented by D. Gabor in 1948 as a two-step lensless imaging technique to enhance the resolution of electron microscopy, for which he received the 1971 Nobel Prize in physics. The distinctive feature of holography is the recording of the object phase variations that carry the depth information, which is lost in conventional photography where only the intensity (= squared amplitude) distribution of an object is captured. Since all photosensitive media necessarily respond to the intensity incident upon them, an ingenious way had to be found to convert object phase into intensity variations, and Gabor achieved this by introducing a coherent reference wave along with the object wave during exposure. Gabor's in-line recording scheme, however, required the object in question to be largely transmissive, and could provide only marginal image quality due to unwanted terms simultaneously reconstructed along with the desired wavefront. Further handicapped by the lack of a strong coherent light source, optical holography thus seemed fated to remain just another scientific curiosity, until the field was revolutionized in the early 1960s by some major breakthroughs: the proposition and demonstration of the laser principle, the introduction of off-axis holography, and the invention of volume holography. Consequently, the remainder of that decade saw an exponential growth in research on theory, practice, and applications of holography. Today, holography not only boasts a wide variety of scientific and technical applications (e.g., holographic interferometry for strain, vibration, and flow analysis, microscopy and high-resolution imagery, imaging through distorting media, optical interconnects, holographic optical elements, optical neural networks, three-dimensional displays, data storage, etc.), but has become a prominent am advertising, and security medium as well. The evolution of holographic optical memories has followed a path not altogether different from holography itself, with several cycles of alternating interest over the past four decades. P. J. van Heerden is widely credited for being the first to elucidate the principles behind holographic data storage in a 1963 paper, predicting bit storage densities on the order of 1/lambda(sup 3) with source wavelength lambda - a fantastic capacity of nearly 1 TB/cu cm for visible light! The science and engineering of such a storage paradigm was heavily pursued thereafter, resulting in many novel hologram multiplexing techniques for dense data storage, as well as important advances in holographic recording materials. Ultimately, however, the lack of such enabling technologies as compact laser sources and high performance optical data I/O devices dampened the hopes for the development of a commercial product. After a period of relative dormancy, successful applications of holography in other arenas sparked a renewed interest in holographic data storage in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. Currently, with most of the critical optoelectronic device technologies in place and the quest for an ideal holographic recording medium intensified, holography is once again considered as one of several future data storage paradigms that may answer our constantly growing need for higher-capacity and faster-access memories.","Timucin, Dogan A and Downie, John D",0,,1467

2066,Children's success at detecting circular explanations and their interest in future learning,"These studies explore elementary-school-aged children's ability to evaluate circular explanations and whether they respond to receiving weak explanations by expressing interest in additional learning. In the first study, 6-, 8-, and 10-year-olds (n = 53) heard why questions about unfamiliar animals. For each question, they rated the quality of single explanations and later selected the best explanation between pairs of circular and noncircular explanations. When judging single explanations, 8- and 10-year-olds, and to some extent 6-year-olds, provided higher ratings for noncircular explanations compared to circular ones. When selecting between pairs of explanations, all age groups preferred noncircular explanations to circular ones, but older children did so more consistently than 6-year-olds. Children who recognized the weakness of the single circular explanations weremore interested in receiving additional information about the question topics. In Study 2, all three age groups (n = 87) provided higher ratings for noncircular explanations compared to circular ones when listening to responses to how questions, but older children showed a greater distinction in their ratings than 6-year-olds. Moreover, the link between recognizing circular explanations as weak and interest in future learning could not be accounted for solely by individual differences in verbal intelligence. These findings illustrate the developmental trajectory of explanation evaluation and support that recognition of weak explanations is linked to interest in future learning across the elementary years. Implications for education are discussed.","Mills, Candice M and Danovitch, Judith H and Rowles, Sydney P and Campbell, Ian L",0,10.3758/s13423-016-1195-2,1469
2067,Black Excellence: Fostering Intellectual Curiosity in Minority Honors Students at a Predominantly White Research Institution,"As a recent alumnus of the West Virginia University Honors College, I recognize my honors experience as a multi-faceted, intellectual journey that pushed me academically, professionally, and personally to become the lifelong learner that I am today. As the only Black honors student in my graduating class, I was aware of my tokenism, especially in my honors courses, in the honors college office, in the honors learning center (testWELL Learning Center), and in university and honors college committee meetings, but I never let it bother me much. My peers misperceived me as an ""Oreo""; my physical appearance was Black, yet my mannerisms and opinions were ""White"" to them. Again, that did not bother me because I felt at home among my honors college peers--until my senior year, when I took my first study abroad trip. After that trip, I experienced my first engagement with the Black community at the university and spent a semester unpacking my distorted understanding of African Americans in American history primarily through the mentorship of a remarkable Black woman. By the end of the semester, I understood the importance of correcting my White friends' sense of privilege, representing and advocating for my community in this elite academic space of honors, and paving the way for other Black students to succeed in higher education. My self-awakening came at a pivotal time in my life, and it sealed my interdisciplinary interest in law and education. As I have learned so far in law school, an individual who wants to change the status quo needs first to understand all the nuances and intricacies of an issue, so I address this essay to honors administrators--and other readers-- who need to understand how to effectively foster Black students' curiosity in honors. First, through the eyes of Black millennials, I define intellectual curiosity as Black Excellence and show the struggle and resilience of those who strive to be excellent. Next, I contextualize this struggle by analyzing national population statistics, enrollment data at four-year public research institutions, and student anecdotes about their educational experience. I continue by creating a foundational outline of the areas that honors colleges and honors programs can use to foster Black Excellence at their institutions, and finally I provide suggestions for honors colleges and programs to build upon the foundational outline and effectively foster Black Excellence.","Scott, Stephen C",0,,1470

It was based on the experience of a group of professors and lecturers whose professional profile covers both economic and engineering fields. The final aim of the project was to increase the interest of the students in this kind of courses by means of stimulating their curiosity and the perceived utility of the knowledge and skills acquired. This was achieved by the introduction of information technologies not only as e-learning tools but also as part of the learning competencies that all engineering graduates should have acquired during their studies. The results of the project have been measured by both objective and subjective indicators: the numerical grades obtained by the students in the courses and their personal evaluation of the contents, learning methods and skills achieved. As well as this, the time consumption of the different learning activities has been recorded for every student and the evolution of these records has been analyzed.","Suarez Sanchez, Ana and Riesgo Fernandez, Pedro and Iglesias Rodriguez, Francisco J and Garcia Nieto, Paulino J",0,,1472
2071,Editor's introduction: The role of journal thematic issues in developing an agenda and filling the literature gaps for mental health research with Muslim participants,"The Journal of Muslim Mental Health (JMMH) enters its fourth year of publication, a marked change can be noticed with regards to published behavioral health literature related to Muslims. Several years ago it was difficult to find research papers with Muslim participants, whereas now there are a handful published yearly. This burgeoning interest in understanding the psychosocial and mental health experiences of Muslims is long overdue and much needed. Though the tragedy of September 11 catalyzed a healthy curiosity in learning about the faith shared by Muslims, it also placed undue stressors on Muslim communities in North America, Europe, and other parts of the world. There are numerous obstacles to expanding the repertoire of mental health research focused on Muslims. One of the key ways to generate and promote research in a particular area, and purposefully fill gaps in the literature, is to develop thematic issues such as the ones we have published in JMMH. As JMMH continues to expand we look forward to continuing a tradition of publishing timely thematic issues. In light of the current wars and humanitarian crises in many predominantly Muslim countries, we are preparing a special issue focused on refugees and forced migrants.

Specific unit lesson plans are provided in this project description. In unit 1, students learned about collecting and processing information and about competition, specialization, and productive resources, as they applied to the auto liner and the auto liner company. Students toured the ship, interviewed longshoremen on strike at the time, wrote letters, and listened to guest speakers. It was the students' interest and curiosity that led to a study of the port of Wilmington and international trade. They learned about the labor and capital resources of the port, supply and demand, competition, specialization, why countries trade, the costs and benefits of interdependence, the function of money in world trade, and the effects of trade restraints. In the unit activities, students read material published by the port of Wilmington, studied maps, role played, set up an assembly line, conducted surveys, and participated in debates.

2074,Implementation of Buzz Learning to English Language Education in a Junior High School,"In this paper, the history and current state of Japanese cooperative learning techniques in English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) education for Japanese junior high school students is surveyed, and an empirically-based argument is made in favor of using BAZU (BUZZ) techniques. The past and current methods of teaching English in Japan have left students with little confidence in their ability to speak English and correspondingly little interest in learning more. Buzz Learning is a cooperative theory based on the premise that depends on the interactive human relationships of the learners. It operates on the empirically demonstrated fact that the meaningful use of these interpersonal relationships makes independent and effective learning possible. The group and cooperative basis of Buzz Learning helps students to learn from one another and can be effective in mitigating characteristics attributed to Japanese learners, such as shyness and group consciousness. The introduction of Buzz Learning techniques at the junior high school level has resulted in dramatically improved reading ability, an augmented ability to learn by themselves, fewer students with inferiority complexes, and students learning out of curiosity rather than just obligation.

2076,Bion and being: Passion and the creative mind,"Bion introduced a new psychoanalytic space in which to explore the mind. This new space is reflected in his concept of O, in my view the background to all of his work, which therefore forms a large part of the focus of this book. By now, his ideas are widely known throughout the analytic world, and yet the revolutionary meaning of some of these ideas has, in certain ways, been underestimated. This is especially true of his concept of O, which has brought to psychoanalysis the metaphysical perspective of the mystic. It represents a global change that affects all aspects of analytic work, for it shifts our perspective of the kind of mind necessary to conduct an analysis. It is this change that I will examine. The concept of O represents a different psychical point of view, and all of our previous observations about the human mind are affected by this shift. Bion's ideas have often been subject to confusion or misunderstanding, partially related to the fact that ""O"" represents an ineffable metaphysical state beyond rational understanding and, therefore, beyond verbal description. While Bion's influence is widespread, he seemed to be aware of the dangerous possibility of a person's being ""loaded with honours [till he sinks] without a trace"" (Bion, 1970, p. 78). Although this has not happened to him, Bion's ideas reflect complex realities, and efforts to simplify them or ""understand"" them intellectually have, at times, drained them of their essential mystery. Bion distrusted the very function of understanding as a limitation to one's ability to experience the non-sensual metaphysical mind, that is, to one's capacity for contact with O. I have often been impressed by both the widespread dissemination and profound interest in Bion's work, as well as the confusion, particularly around this concept of O. Lively discussions have convinced me both of the enduring curiosity about this idea and the fear of the emotional experience it engenders. Then again, this kind of ambivalent feeling is always present in relation to these unknown and unknowable states of mind. Because of the difficulties in communicating about such ineffable states, I will make use of other metaphorical means in an effort to evoke something of their mystery through comparisons with artistic, scientific, religious, and philosophical truths. The works of creative artists who access this experience in their work will, I hope, help to provide emotional overtones to the theories of Bion and other psychoanalytic thinkers, to augment this enigmatic realm of mental life. It is no less a topic than existence itself, an ontological exploration of a sense of being, or selfhood, or existence which is the requisite state of mind for contact with O.

2079,The mediated image: Reflections on semasiographic notation in the ancient Americas,"In recent years, the long-standing model of a dichotomous relationship between text and image, a mainstay of the semiotic approach to visual communication, has fallen increasingly under criticism.1 Our daily interactions with computers and icons of all kinds make it obvious that the world is populated by countless varieties of conventionalized and codified visual signs that operate outside the strictures of language. There are any number of visual codes that are neither purely text nor purely image. This realization is reflected by increased scholarly attention and greatly expanded curiosity about the workings of these alternate forms, which are known as ""semasiographies."" This shift ultimately makes the present analysis possible. Scholarship on semasiography ranges from discourse analysis and visual culture studies to linguistics and cognitive science. It is a challenging array of disciplines; the category includes everything from symbolic diagramming and math to transit maps and, of course, pictographies and hieroglyphics-genres of great interest among Americanists. Such multiplicity points to the fact that ""semasiography"" is actually an umbrella term covering a range of graphic systems and operative structures. Sometimes called ""discourse systems"" or ""nonphonetic writing,"" semasiographies are capable of conveying relatively specific information in codified or conventionalized form, but they are not designed to directly reflect speech. Scholars such as Brice (1976), Sampson (1985), Boone (2004), Boone and Mignolo (1994), Elkins (1999), Houston (2004a, 2004b), Jackson (2000, 2008), Martin (2006), and others have sought to define ""semasiography,"" which is based on the Greek semasia (""meaning"") combined with graph (""drawn/written""). Yet, just as with words like ""writing"" and ""pictures,"" the concept encompasses a vast, contested territory, making an absolute definition elusive. Semasiography refers to those conventionalized systems of visual notation arranged primarily around nonphonetic principles of ordering whose overall meanings are derived from the spatial and/or performative relationships among the constituent elements. Semasiographies may incorporate a range of meaningful elements, including phonetic signs, logographs, ideographs, pictures, or direct material relationships. The systems are distinguished from complex iconographies by their capacity to create and record new information (Boone 2004, 317-18; Martin 2006, 76). They seem to work best (and occur most often) within strictly limited areas of reference (Sampson 1985, 30; Brice 1976, 41-43), even though, in theory, it need not necessarily be so. Semasiographic systems are often active participants, or mediators, within specific performative contexts, as suggested by the title of this chapter. The idea of mediation is used here in its most traditional sense, that is, as something occupying an intermediate place or position, one that, in some instances, serves to mediate between parties to reconcile or bring about an accord or understanding. It is not used in its most contemporary sense, as a word that connotes a situation where traditional forms, like print or painting, have become ""media"" through translation into digital or electronic form-that is to say, older forms that become ""remediated"" (see Bolter and Grusin 1999, 34-50). -absp Because they focus less on phoneticism, semasiographic models offer a flexible- And less value-laden-way to address visual systems that are not directly tied to spoken language. This does, in fact, represent a new paradigm for studies of Ancient American visual art. The Saussurian dialectic that dominated semiotic discourse for most of the twentieth century, elaborated in what follows, has strongly affected the ways in which indigenous visual cultures in the Americas have been approached, in many cases perpetuating the idea that native people were illiterate (with the attendant pejorative associations). Semasiographic studies represent a means by which to alleviate and (one hopes) eventually eliminate this particular colonialist stigmatization. Apart from the social considerations, the introduction of a revised paradigm allows us to better understand and differentiate among communicatory approaches that may have varying degrees of verbal, visual, or other sensory modal components. The focus of this chapter, therefore, is to illustrate different semasiographies through drawing attention to several Ancient American examples, summarizing some of the key features distinguishing them, not necessarily decoding the meanings of those examples but rather suggesting the places where semasiographic functions occur. In doing so, it becomes possible to discern variable quantities of pictures, phonetic signs, and operational structures in each visual tradition, which, in turn, bear important correlations to agency and, ultimately, to the kinds of meanings that can be extrapolated from particular object categories. <c2><a9> 2013 by University Press of Colorado.

2080,"Overjustification, competing responses, and the acquisition of intrinsic interest","The overjustification hypothesis proposes that expectation of reward for an inherently interesting activity produces less interest in the activity when reward is subsequently unavailable. 2 experiments, with a total of 41 kindergarten and 1st-grade Ss, designed to test this hypothesis are reported. Exp I replicated previous findings that a single trial of noncontingent, promised reward undermines young children's interest in the rewarded play activity (see record). Exp II disconfirmed the overjustification hypothesis by demonstrating that a multiple-trial, contingent reinforcement procedure did not produce an overjustification effect. Findings are understandable in terms of a competing response hypothesis but not in terms of overjustification. Accordingly, previous findings of an overjustification effect are reinterpreted as having demonstrated that curiosity in a novel play activity can be undermined by presentation of distracting stimuli. The following additional conclusions are drawn: (a) The overjustification hypothesis is conceptually vague. (b) Self-perception theory seems to have been concerned with variables relatively unimportant for understanding effects of tangible reward procedures on overt behavior. (c) Recent criticisms that token economies undermine intrinsic interest were based on a failure to appreciate differences between single-trial, noncontingent reward and multiple-trial, contingent reinforcement procedures.

A culturally relevant theoretical framework, Funds of Knowledge, informs the iSTEM program, a program based on the contention that the synergistic effect of a hybrid program combining two strategic approaches (1) in-school mentoring and (2) out-of-school informal science education experiences would foster engagement and interest in STEM learning. Students are paired with one of three types of mentors: Native American community members, university students, and STEM professionals. The iSTEM program is theme based with all program activities specifically relevant to Native people living in southern Arizona. Student mentees and mentors complete interactive flash STEM activities at lunch hour and attend approximately six field trips per year.

2083,APPROACH TO THE PROFESSION OF CIVIL ENGINEERING BY PHYSICAL SCALE MODELS,"Many times academic works, research findings or professional issues are far from knowledge of general society. Non-technician people find difficulties in accessing to the work developed by lecturers and researchers at Universities or Research Institutes.

How do debaters who make it past the preliminary rounds at the World Universities Debate Championship identify gaps in their knowledge? 3. What study behaviors and skills do debaters who make it past the preliminary rounds at the World Universities Debate Championship exhibit? Findings. A total of 11 themes emerged that answered the research questions and interview questions. Some themes provided insight to multiple research questions: (a) absence of formal coaching; (b) discussion, interaction, and receiving and giving support among peers and veterans stood in for formal coaching; (c) perceived lack of mentorship behaviors; (d) absence of formal research practices; (e) motivated to learn by innate curiosity; (f) importance of a wide knowledge base; (g) strategies for identifying knowledge gaps; (h) recurring and useful sources; (i) emancipation from case files; (j) vetting material for use in debate rounds; and (k) debaters look up to other debaters. Conclusions. Much of debater behavior is incongruent with self-directed learning theory; however, there is some overlap. Recommendations. Research should investigate how learners emancipate when there is no guidance from leaders. It should be discovered whether people with certain interests, inclinations, and curiosities seek out debate; if individuals who join debate adopt interests, inclinations, and curiosities; or if some combination of the two occurs. Self-directed learning theory<e2><80><99>s scope needs expanding to look at learners<e2><80><99> postemancipation behavior. More should be done to understand the effectiveness of using interaction to vet information and learning strategies.

This study explored the interactions and the usability of various search interfaces, and the enjoyment or uncertainty experienced by children when using them. Structural Equation Modeling was used to determine whether children feel uncertainty or a sense of control when using virtual game-like interfaces to search for information associated with entertainment or as a means to satisfy an assigned learning task. We then analyzed the weight relationships among three latent variables (information needs, interface media, and affective state) using statistical (path) analysis. Our results indicate that children prefer using a retrieval interface with situated affordance to satisfy entertainment-related information needs, as opposed to searching for information to solve specific problems. Furthermore, their perceptions of text and graphic icons determined the degree to which they experienced a sense of uncertainty or control. When searching for entertainment-related information, they were better able to deal with uncertainty and sought greater control in their search interface, compared to when they were searching for information related to assigned tasks. According to their information needs, children may regard a game-like interface as a toy or a tool for learning. The results of this study can serve as reference for the future development of information search interfaces aimed at arousing the interest of children. The use of virtual game-like interfaces to guide the IS behavior of children warrants further study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Wu, Ko-Chiu",0,10.1016/j.ipm.2015.02.005,1488

2096,Arts Education and Media Literacy in the Primary Education Teaching Degree of the University of Granada,"In the context of university teacher training, artistic education and the teaching of visual arts, although belonging to the specific area of artistic expression didactics, are considered an interdisciplinary area (Art Education and Arts Education). The contents of this area of teaching, mainly focused on image and visual culture, is being influenced by digital media in the creation, dissemination and reception of artistic contents, especially with the use of mobile devices. The conjunction of media literacy and the work related to artistic creativity constitutes the starting point of the current study, in which we have consulted 105 fourth-year students of the Primary Education Teaching Degree of the University of Granada (Spain) about their interests in media-related matters, as well as the links that they establish between visual art teaching and digital culture tools. This text offers the results of a quantitative survey that clearly shows the preference of the students for the audiovisual artistic genres, with special interest in photography and film, and their curiosity for new aspects, such as animation, although maintaining some interest in the traditional arts, such as drawing or painting. This is a generation that is characterised for having developed their creation and consumption of visual media on social networks, but that need training in media literacy. Ultimately, it is a synthesis of the understanding that the students currently have of artistic education and of its possibilities in the context of audiovisual and digital media.

2097,What is Symbolic Mathematics Language Literacy? A Multilevel Mixed Methods Study of Adolescents in a Middle School,"The language of mathematics may be the most influential language ever codified in a writing system. Despite the ubiquity of the language, literacy for mathematics remains something of a curiosity. It is not defined in critical educational policy documents such as the Common Core State Standards. The emphasis on disciplinary literacy has renewed interest in distinguishing literacy for mathematics from mathematics proficiency and from English language literacy. I conceptualized symbolic mathematics language literacy (SMaLL) as the ability to read and write symbolic mathematics using the conventions of the writing system for the language of mathematics. SMaLL, by this definition, is scarcely acknowledged or explored in educational research. My objective in conducting this exploratory study was to gain novel insights into SMaLL among middle school students learning under the Common Core State Standards with implications for instructional practice. Guided by the theory of developmental bio-cultural co-constructivism, I adapted data collection tools from English language literacy research and implemented a multilevel concurrent mixed methods research design. In sum, I integrated quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches to understand SMaLL as a complex component of human development shaped by interactions within and across three levels of change: cultural, behavioral, and neurobiological. The results of the quantitative analysis of cognitive measures of students ability to read symbolic mathematics indicated that SMaLL is systematically related to measures of mathematics achievement. The results of the qualitative analysis of students metacognitive reflections on SMaLL indicated that assessing the symbolic mathematics features is critical to determining whether or not mathematical text was readable. In addition, decoding mathematical symbols appears to be a critical SMaLL reading strategy. The mixed methods integrated results yielded a multilevel model of SMaLL describing how the in-class use of the language of mathematics, metacognitive strategies, and cognitive processing interact and contribute to the ways middle school students read symbolic mathematics in selections of typical academic texts. The model reveals three important aspects, one for each level, of SMaLL. First, developing SMaLL, or learning to read symbolic mathematics, requires assistance and depends on social interaction. Second, reading the language of mathematics is a process of navigating the ambiguity of the symbolic mathematics. It involves metacognitive behavior aimed at perceiving the meaning of symbols and producing an English language representation of the written text. Third, reading the language of mathematics involves the coordination of automated cognitive processes: orthographic processing, phonological processing, semantic processing, and emotional regulation. The substantive findings have implications for future studies dedicated to refining a theory of SMaLL, developing methods and measurement tools to further investigate SMaLL, and tailoring instruction to support SMaLL development. In addition, this study advances the field of mixed methods research by providing an exemplar of a multilevel concurrent mixed methods study and introducing a novel conceptualization of multilevel variants of mixed methods research designs for use with theoretically defined levels and within-person investigations.

2100,Individualizing gender and sexuality: Theory and practice,"Nancy Chodorow, in her groundbreaking book The Reproduction of Mothering, quite simply changed the conversation in at least three areas of study: psychoanalysis, women's studies, and sociology. In her latest book, Individualizing Gender and Sexuality, she examines the complexity and uniqueness of each person's personal creation of sexuality and gender and the ways that these interrelate with other aspects of psychic and cultural life. She brings her well-known theoretical agility, wide-ranging interdisciplinarity, and clinical experience to every chapter, advocating for the clinician's openness, curiosity, and theoretical pluralism. The book begins with reflections on Freud's Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, followed by considerations of Melanie Klein and Stephen Mitchell, as well as on her own work and on the postmodern turn in psychoanalytic gender theory. Subsequent chapters address contemporary clinical-cultural issues such as women and work, women and motherhood, and men and violence. Concluding chapters elaborate on the multiple ingredients and the personal affective, conflictual, and defensive constellations and processes that create sexuality and gender in each individual. Ending with a chapter on homosexualities as compromise formations, Chodorow deepens her account of clinical individuality and sex-gender transference-countertransference while bringing her readers back to Freud and to the many strands that followed, as she consolidates a consistent line of interest in sexuality and gender, theory and practice, sustained over a lifetime. <c2><a9> 2012 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Chodorow, N J",0,10.4324/9780203816066,1495
2102,Gazing the hood: Hip-Hop as tourism attraction,"Hip-Hop is a new cultural phenomenon originating in the US. Its influence can be seen in music, fashion, language and the club scenes in the global context. Tourism is a special form of ""gaze"" constructing the other. This paper attempts to contextualize Hip-Hop tourism by problematizing the interrelations between culture, tourists, and attractions, situating a discussion of these relationships within the wider discourses of gaze and authenticity. It suggests that Hip-Hop tourism is an important, if neglected, component of cultural tourism, and proposes that Hip-Hop tourism can be viewed through three technologies of gazes: (1) initial gaze: voyeurism, mimesis and appropriation of black culture. Hip-Hop tourism begins with the initial gaze by tourists attracted through the curiosity about the other; (2) mass gaze: commodification and globalization. Hip-Hop has evolved from ""folk culture"" to ""popular culture"", and eventually to ""mass culture"" consumed in many ways; (3) authentic gaze: authenticity is sought by Hip-Hop tourists as special interest tourism. The study concludes that Hip-Hop can be an important asset for tourism marketing and planning worldwide. <c2><a9> 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

2104,Researching with centenarians,"Aims and objectives: The objectives were shaped by ways in which to best engage the readers' curiosity about being 100 years old. Background: In the effort to reverse negative stereotyping associated with older people, the aim was to produce a book of individual stories for public readership that had the power to combat ageism and to present alternative constructions. Methods: Twenty-four centenarians were interviewed. Each person was asked to retell, using their own words, something about themselves and the social context that had shaped their lives. Centenarians could select whatever was foremost in their minds; an aspect of their lives that they wanted to share. We asked a few standard questions: What is it like to have lived one hundred years? What, in your opinion, has contributed to longevity? What matters today? A conversational approach to interviewing was adopted with the use of prompts to encourage story telling. Results: Centenarians privileged talking about their early years, childhood, going to school and first employment. Although most people could relate to a country upbringing and fewer years at school, subsequent life experiences and opportunities were diverse. Advice to others who desired a long life was keeping active, leading a simple life, eating well, working hard, maintaining an interest in events and surroundings, helping others and being moderate in all things. Maintaining a sense of humour was thought to be important. Loss of eyesight, mostly in the last few years, had been a profound disruption in the lives, creating new dependencies. Extensive family cohesion and frequent contact with others who cared was a profound feature. There appears to be a matter of fact appraisal of difficulties, losses and sadness but these were considered to be part of life and not particularly extraordinary. It seemed that these people had made a successful transition to living beyond 100 years old by leaving stress behind and moving on. Embedded in the stories of centenarians was a sense of self that was strong and resilient. Conclusions: The book containing 24 separate stories was published by Penguin. Sharing the stories of centenarians provided an opportunity to engage with the public readership and help shape wider social perceptions of older people as worth listening to. Relevance to clinical practice: In this paper, alternatives to dominant stories about ageing are presented and challenge the negative stereotyping of older people and its associated notions of decline, dementia, decay and death. Its relevance to clinical practice is precisely to show that older people are worth listening to. Moreover their ordinary lives make interesting, popular readership. Although the stories were primed to reach a wide public audience, we argue that its health promotion message and our creative effort to combat negative stereotypes can filter to healthcare delivery.

2106,Teaching an application of Bayes' rule for legal decision-making: Measuring the strength of evidence,"Although Bayesian methodology has become a powerful approach for describing uncertainty, it has largely been avoided in undergraduate statistics education. Here we demonstrate that one can present Bayes' Rule in the classroom through a hypothetical, yet realistic, legal scenario designed to spur the interests of students in introductory-and intermediate-level statistics classes. The teaching scenario described in this paper not only illustrates the practical application of Bayes' Rule to legal decision-making, but also emphasizes the cumulative nature of the Bayesian method in measuring the strength of the evidence. This highlights the Bayesian method as an alternative to the traditional inferential methods, such as p value and hypothesis tests. Within the context of the legal scenario, we also introduce DNA analysis, implement a modified version of Bayes' Rule, and utilize Bayes' Factor in the computation process to further promote students' intellectual curiosities and incite lively discussion pertaining to the jury decision-making process about the defendant's status of guilt. <c2><a9> 2014 by Eiki Satake and Amy Vashlishan Murray all rights reserved.","Satake, E and Murray, A V",0,10.1080/10691898.2014.11889692,1498

2109,Science Learning Centres Roundup,"A recent YouGov poll indicated that almost half of eight to 18-year-olds aspire to a career in science. The latest Association of Colleges enrolment survey indicates a large increase in uptake of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) at further education (FE) colleges. These reports, along with other findings that suggest an increased appetite for science subjects at school, are to be welcomed. To counterbalance the good news, however, the Royal Society presents a different perspective in its ""state of the nation"" reports. These suggest that many children lose interest in mathematics and science during secondary school and that, despite an increase in the number of pupils taking triple science subjects at General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE), there are still too few pupils taking science subjects at A-level to secure the uptake that educators are looking for into higher education and STEM-based careers. So, what can be done to ensure that pupils from an early age can be inspired by science and mathematics, and then sustain that passion, curiosity and ability all the way through school, into higher education and beyond? Both subject specialist and non-specialist science teachers need to keep abreast of cutting edge science to ensure that their teaching is relevant, topical and inspiring.

2110,The Idea of a University: Grey Philistines Taking over Our Universities,"In this article, the author stresses the danger of losing the concept of education in favour of lower notions of instruction and training. By ""training"" he means a process that suggests the acquisition of skills and the enhancing of performance capacities. By ""instruction"" he means learning facts and new information--the results of retention. Too often, states McKernan, even those in universities confuse training and instruction with pure ""education."" Traditional (basic) research, what may be thought of as ""blue sky"" inquiry in the human and social sciences, is being viewed as inappropriate in favour of applied scientific ""evidence-based"" research methodologies where grant money is being currently channeled. The problem is that the grey philistines who are ""running"" the colleges and universities claim, falsely, to be businessmen running enterprises that will bring greater economic growth and riches through applied research--not ""blue sky"" inquiry. The author believes that there are very real possibilities that education can be reclaimed from these ""grey philistines and merchants of managerialism."" The idea of a university is that it is a community of scholars having a discourse, using a variety of research methods ""appropriate to their discipline"" to advance knowledge, to contribute to searching for truth through inquiry, to conduct teaching of this knowledge and these methods, so that students can get into perspective the knowledge that they ""do not yet possess"" and to offer service to the university and the community. The main thing is to permit academic freedom in the pursuit of these inquiries. Academic freedom means that lecturers and professors have an unfettered right to select materials and methods appropriate to their discipline and the right to conduct research that matches their curiosity and interests.","McKernan, Jim",0,,1502

2113,Uncertainty and Novelty-Based Selective Attention in the Collaborative Exploration of Unknown Environments,"We propose a multi-agent approach to the problem of exploring unknown environments that relies on providing the agents with a measure of interest for the viewpoints of the surrounding environment. Such measure of interest takes into account the expected decrease in uncertainty provided by acquiring the information of objects seen from a viewpoint and the novelty of the potential class label of those objects. This allows the agents to visit selectively the objects that populate the environment. This single agent exploration strategy is combined with a multi-agent exploration strategy relying on a brokering system that allows the coordination of the agent team according to the agents's personal interest and their distance to the viewpoints. The advantages of these forms of selective attention, together with those of the collaborative multi-agent exploration strategy, are tested in several scenarios, comparing our approach against classical ones.","Macedo, Luis and Tavares, Miguel and Gaspar, Pedro and Cardoso, Amilcar",0,,1505
2114,Burial societies in rural ethiopia,"Collective action has both intrinsic and instrumental value. Being part of a group and participating toward meeting a common objective provides direct benefits to individuals. In the Ethiopian survey data used in this study, individuals who reported having larger networks also reported higher levels of happiness. Such correlations are not unique to Ethiopia. Using data from the World Values Survey, Helliwell and Putnam (2004) found that individuals who reported higher levels of individual and collective civic engagement also reported higher scores on measures of subjective well-being. Collective action is also a means to an end. For example, the joint management of irrigation canals, rangelands, and fisheries involves actions by groups that allow individuals to generate higher and more sustainable incomes. This chapter focuses on a specific, instrumental dimension of collective action: the role of groups and networks in helping households in poor communities manage their exposure to risks and cope with shocks to their livelihoods, which are identified as an important determinant of poverty and well-being by Di Gregorio et al. (this volume, Chapter 2). In doing so, the chapter builds on research addressing how poor households respond to shocks; see Morduch (2005) and references therein, the review paper by Skoufias and Quisumbing (2005), and the recent collection edited by Dercon (2005). These show that in the face of shocks households can partially smooth consumption, but not perfectly; as might be expected, idiosyncratic shocks (for instance, low or late rainfall on household plots) are more likely to be insured collectively than are generalized shocks (such as low rainfall on most plots in the village). In most empirical studies of risk smoothing-for example, that of Townsend (1994)-the insurance unit has been assumed to be the village. Studies using Townsend's approach have often found that households are able to cope with idiosyncratic shocks but not covariate shocks, implying that local insurance mechanisms are inadequate to cope with aggregate shocks. More recent studies (for example, that of Munshi and Rosenzweig 2005) have begun to question the assumption that the appropriate unit of risk smoothing is the village. They suggest that consumption is smoothed within subcaste networks that extend beyond the village. Indeed, the literature on migration and remittances suggests that networks can cross geographic boundaries, with the formation of migrant networks at destination sites affected by shocks in the original locality (Munshi 2003). There is also a subset of studies that has attempted to isolate the role of gift giving and informal loans in helping households to cope with shocks. The results indicate that households are not perfectly ""altruistic""; the problems of asymmetric information and limited commitment mean that households are not likely to be fully insured (Foster and Rosenzweig 2000; Ligon, Thomas, and Worral 2000). 1 However, such analyses do not assess whether responses differ depending on the nature of the shock, and indicators for collective action and participation in different types of networks are generally either absent or rudimentary. There are some exceptions. Fafchamps and Lund (2003) differentiated among different types of risk, specifically addressing how different sorts of networks are used. They showed that risk sharing appears to occur mostly in very small networks of close friends and families-networks that may not have the heterogeneity required to efficiently share risk. In the case of Ethiopia, Dercon and Krishnan (2000) specifically addressed potential gender differences in terms of risk coping and found that poor women, particularly in one region, are less able to smooth consumption in the face of risks. The collective action literature shows that the density of networks in general, and participation in more formal groups in particular, can lead to either more effective participation in community-based activities (White and Runge 1994; Isham and Kahkonen 2002) or higher household incomes (Narayan and Pritchett 1999; Pender and Scherr 2002; Haddad and Maluccio 2003). However, there is a lack of consensus on the impact of heterogeneity on collective action. In most empirical studies in which researchers have used various measures of heterogeneity to examine its impact on collective action or on household incomes directly, the impact of any type of heterogeneity has tended to be negative or not significant (Ahuja 1998; Alesina and La Ferrara 2000; Bardhan 2000; McCarthy and Vanderlinden 2004; Place et al. 2004), with the interesting exception of results reported by Grootaert (2001). It is often hypothesized that heterogeneity of any sort makes finding agreements mutually beneficial and acceptable to all more costly and that sociocultural heterogeneity in particular is likely to reduce trust among group members and also to reduce the efficacy of social sanctioning (Easterly and Levine 1997). On the other hand, much of the literature on group formation and networks highlights the added benefits to diversity (or heterogeneity) among members along any number of dimensions. Risk pooling is certainly more efficient when one's income is less correlated with that of other members of the groups, which implies that having members with different agricultural activities and occupational structures is better for the insurance mechanism. Many networks exist to share information; clearly if everyone has the same background and the same current sociocultural and economic profile, there is little need to rely on networks to share information. Finally, there may be economies of scope in terms of information gathering-or accumulation of other assets, for that matter. In this case, economic heterogeneity also favors the pooling of resources to the benefit of all. Because there may be competing impacts of different types of heterogeneity on the functioning of groups, it becomes critical to examine which groups are able to harness the positive effects of heterogeneity and mitigate its negative effects. Finally, if groups differ in terms of degree of heterogeneity and geographic dispersion, what kinds of enforcement mechanisms can be used to ensure compliance with network objectives and norms of behavior? Members of local networks are easier to monitor, but local networks are less able to insure against covariate shocks. Spatially diversified networks offer some protection against covariate shocks, but network members will be more difficult to monitor. If information and communications technologies are poor, more distant network members may not even be aware of a shock that occurred in their original communities. Interest in these issues is more than just a matter of academic curiosity. Understanding these networks is as crucial to understanding the determinants of poverty and the policies necessary to move people out of poverty as understanding land tenure or access to financial capital. A misunderstanding of the roles of these networks can lead to policy changes that have unintended consequences on the functioning of the networks, with potentially damaging effects on the capacity of the poor to mitigate, and cope with, the effects of shocks. At the same time, a better understanding of such networks can lead to the identification of policies that complement networks that already serve the poor well and also to policies that can substitute for networks that simply are not reaching the poor. In terms of the conceptual framework presented in Chapter 2, this chapter focuses on the impact of risks and shocks (especially natural shocks in the form of drought, death, and illness) on household well-being and the role of local collective action institutions in dealing with these risks. We show the impact of asset endowments (human and natural capitals, in particular) on the severity of these shocks, as well as on the composition of the groups and networks. We also discuss the size of collective action institutions and their scope to effectively contribute to poverty and vulnerability reduction. Using the language of the conceptual framework, the discussion focuses almost exclusively on the internal actors (iddir members) in the action arena, which is represented by the iddir (burial societies or funeral association). The patterns of interaction that emerge here are the innovative forms of cooperation (through cash transfers and loans given to iddir members to cope with a shock) and rules (governing that composition and operation of iddir) that allow poor households to achieve certain poverty-related outcomes, such as maintaining necessary levels of income and fulfilling basic needs, as well as sustaining these groups. More generally, this chapter highlights the potential of local forms of collective action beyond economic groups (such as credit and savings associations) to enable poor households to cope with local shocks by overcoming the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection that the typical insurance schemes face. It provides an interesting bridge from the natural resource management (NRM) literature to the non-NRM poverty studies by showing how the same principles that apply to collective action for resource management (effective rules on membership, sanctions for noncompliance, and so on) can translate into non-NRM arenas and create conditions and incentives for effective group operation-in this case, for managing risks. It adds new insights to the discussion of the impact of heterogeneity on the effectiveness and sustain-ability of local groups and networks, which is of great interest and has long been debated in the NRM literature.

Drawing on culturally relevant, critical pedagogical, and critical literacy theories to understand the educational needs of historically dispossessed cultural groups in the United States and propose a humanizing pedagogy, this article offers critical participatory teacher analysis that suggests this can be done by (a) agitating students politically, (b) arousing their critical curiosity, and (c) inspiring self and social transformation.","Camangian, Patrick Roz",0,,1508
2117,Attention and interest,"Attention defined. Attention is one of the most essential conditions of effective mental work. It is not a distinct power of the mind, nor a specific mode of psychic action, like perception, or representation, or imagination. Any activity of the mind, intensified and concentrated upon some object, involves that condition which we call attention. Attention may be defined as that state of the mind in which its energy and activity are concentrated upon some particular object of observation or of thought. It may also be defined as any form of psychical activity intensified and directed to some particular object. The mental activity is focused upon something to the total or partial exclusion of everything else from consciousness. Interest. The most natural incentive to voluntary attention is interest. In the child what we call curiosity takes the place of interest. The term interest is employed in connection with a great variety of affairs, and with widely different meanings. We are here concerned only to inquire what interest is when spoken of in connection with school affairs and the study of psychology. Interest as Feeling: In strictness of speech interest is not definable; it can be fully known only by personal experience. In the child and, to a considerable extent, but not exclusively, in the mature person, interest is feeling; that is, a more or less excited state of mind, the excitement varying in intensity from a movement so gentle as to be hardly observable in consciousness to a disturbance of a most violent character.

2119,The role of literary content for children in preschool mathematics education,"In this paper, authors point out the need and possibilities of integrating content from literature for children into the process of preschool mathematics education. On concrete examples of various forms of literature for children (picture book, poetic text, story, fairy tale, numerator) point out the role of these contents in the process of learning and building mathematical concepts in preschool mathematical education. The contents from literary for children are viewed as a starting point in the work on mathematical education activities whose role is to create a real-life context, which is close to the child, in which the child is accustomed, in which the child is motivated to participate, as content that excites curiosity and interest in learning of abstract mathematical concepts, and which visualizes mathematical concepts and helps crossing from concrete performances to abstract mathematical performances. <c2><a9> Authors.","Mari<c4><8d>i<c4><87>, S M and Staki<c4><87>, M M and Malinovi<c4><87>-Jovanovi<c4><87>, N T",0,10.12973/ejmste/80627,1510

Gifted children often are not well served by public education, where in some districts the definition of who is gifted has broadened to the extent that even special programs have become too ""dumbed down"" to meet needs of the academically talented. Gifted kids often suffer greatly from loneliness. Even if they have figured out how to participate fully with peers and look as if they ""fit in,"" they still realize they are different.

2125,A Conscious Robot that Can Venture into an Unknown Environment in Search of Pleasure,"A ``conscious system that can venture into an unknown environment'' has been proposed. This study models the process of consciousness of a person who is going into an unknown environment. First, we assumed that to go into an unknown environment, the person needs to be curious about that environment and assured of its safety. Curiosity is a tendency to become interested in unknown phenomena and draw information from them. We consider that to acquire the behavior of going into an unknown environment (curiosity behavior), firstly the person needs in some way to go through many experiences of pleasure in unknown environments and increase curiosity and interest in such environments. To enter an unknown environment the person must also be assured that the environment is safe. We have developed a conscious system that can venture into an unknown environment and tested whether a robot can voluntarily enter an unknown environment.","Takayama, Yuichi and Takeno, Junichi",0,10.1007/978-3-319-63940-6_26,1513

Data collection included a 25-item survey of 1,429 newsletter subscribers; 613 of whom also completed an additional 15 open-ended survey items. The 25 close-ended survey findings indicated that respondents used a wide range of devices and places to learn for their self-directed learning needs. Key motivational factors included curiosity, interest, and internal need for self-improvement. Factors leading to success or personal change included freedom to learn, resource abundance, choice, control, and fun. In terms of achievements, respondents were learning both specific skills as well as more general skills that help them advance in their careers. Science, math, and foreign language skills were the most desired by the survey respondents. The key obstacles or challenges faced were time, lack of high quality open resources, and membership or technology fees. Several brief stories of life change across different age ranges are documented. Among the chief implications is that learning something new to enhance one's life or to help others is often more important than course transcript credit or a certificate of completion.","Bonk, Curtis J and Lee, Mimi Miyoung and Kou, Xiaojing and Xu Shuya and and Sheu, Feng-Ru",0,,1514
2129,Letters from Abroad. Occasional Paper Series 9,"What counts as knowledge and whose knowledge counts? When does going away help shape a clearer sense of home, and when does it not? How does living abroad change our perspectives as teachers and learners? The educators who have contributed to this Occasional Paper share a formidable combination of purpose, curiosity, courage, and self-awareness. Reflecting on their choices to live and work in other parts of the world, they offer a provocative range of personal and professional explanations for seeking our the strange and unknown. Their letters from abroad reveal a genuine interest in what matters to others, a capacity to describe people and environments with intriguing detail, and a willingness to reveal themselves as inexpert newcomers. As these essays make clear, no preparation is ever sufficient because what happens always diverges from and exceeds our expectations. Risk-taking and error are inevitable, as integral to each story as the exhilarating discoveries that travel affords. Most important, we learn how these educators came to value the experience of ""otherness"" in themselves as well as in those they met. Today, we are more mindful than ever of the need for global awareness, understanding, and engagement. ""Letters from Abroad"" is designed to highlight what some Bank Street colleagues have sought, found, and questioned while working far from home. The editors of the Occasional Papers Series hope these missives from foreign shores will inspire others to set out on explorations of their own, explorations in which they resist the temptation to make the strange familiar and enjoy, if only for a short while, the way that the familiar itself may become strange.

In particular, the tenability of a hypothetical construct of interest as it applies to the secondary mathematics classroom was proposed and empirically assessed. Building on previous theoretical work, the study used qualitative and quantitative methodologies to first develop a model and then assess its construct validity. The results indicate that it is useful to distinguish between personal and situational interest. Furthermore, the results indicate that the structure of situational interest is multifaceted, clarifying 5 subfacets of situational interest in the high school mathematics classroom.

2137,Learning science through practical experiences in museums,"School excursions to museums can form an integral and innovative component of school practical learning in science. Museums, however, are informal learning environments where leachers have limited control over the specific ideas or experiences with which the students are engaged. For school groups to make successful use of museums as learning resources, appropriate teaching and learning approaches and strategies, involving a shift from task orientation to student-centred learning orientation, are needed. By allowing student learning to happen in a natural way, that is, by allowing personal interest and curiosity to drive the students' learning, not only will students be gaining more from their excursion, they will be practising scientific investigative processes. Incorporation of the excursion into school-based investigations renders the purposes for the visit clearly apparent, and gives students a goal to achieve back at school using the information gathered at the museum. This article investigates how museum visits can be used to meet three major purposes for practical work, and introduces a framework to facilitate students' learning in museums.","Griffin, J",0,10.1080/0950069980200604,1518
2138,Sociology and its public,"In this interview, Craig Calhoun retraces his peculiar trajectory that, from his first interests in realist cinema and anthropology, brought him to become one of the most original contemporary public sociologists. Realist cinema and the art of documentary are not simple occasional curiosities or forms of escapes, but a way to observe and analyze reality common to the sociological gaze. He therefore discusses the aspects of this multidisciplinary education between Columbia, Manchester and Oxford. Supervised by the British social anthropologist Max Gluckman, his sociological path mixes the Western Marxist debate of the 1970s, Continental social thinkers and Pierre Bourdieu's sociology in new empirical inquiries on a variety of objects and fields like social movements, intellectuals, knowledge, power and the public sphere. In the final part, he identifies the requirements for a contemporary critical sociology that, avoiding to be reduced to an abstract theorizing or a new academic specialization, can fulfill its role of scientific discipline and public utility. <c2><a9> 2017 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

2139,The development of creativity within talent domains,"Creativity is not solely for the most able, the most interested, or the most motivated. Developing creativity within general education, as well as in specialized advanced opportunities, supports talent development in at least three ways. First, providing creative opportunities for all students helps teachers ""talent spot"" students with exceptional ability, interest, or persistence in particular creative disciplines. It is hard to demonstrate curiosity about a topic without any opportunity to investigate it. Second, teaching students about the creative workings of various subjects can provide students with a vision of how a discipline moves forward and how they might, one day, contribute. Finally, both in general education and more advanced talent development opportunities, teaching creative processes and habits of mind, as well as disciplinary strategies for inquiry, can provide the tools necessary for students to make their own creative contributions. All of our students need the skills and vision to incorporate creativity in their lives. Those students with advanced abilities and interests have a need for creativity at every stage of their talent development in order to advance the disciplines they study.

2141,The long and tortuous history of the discovery of testosterone and its clinical application,"Introduction: The testis importance in homeostasis was recognized for millennia, but a consistent interest in exploring their endocrine function only goes back to about a century. Aim: The aim of this study is to provide a succinct perspective of the events leading to the discovery of testosterone, the mind-boggling early attempts at therapy and today's situation. Method: The literature was reviewed with searches in OvidSP Medline, PubMed, and Google Scholar under the headings of testosterone/androgens history. Due to the explosion of reports between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a manual review of the collection of the period's journals at the university's library was performed. Pertinent books were consulted for specific biographical details. Results: There is a robust body of literature dealing with testicular function for the period starting in the late 1800s. It is illustrative to learn the painful efforts of many well-intentioned and honest scientists with more conviction and determination than knowledge. Among them, unfortunately, a number of charlatans and profiteers tainted the concept of hypogonadism and its treatment with repercussions lasting until this day. The discovery and synthesis of testosterone represent the effort of brilliant minds (two Nobel Prizes) in various countries and frequently working for the pharmaceutical industry. Shortly after testosterone became available, controversy arose about its application, use, abuse, and potential detrimental effects. Over the decades, the hullabaloo about hypogonadism and its treatment has focused on a variety of issues ranging from absurd efficacy claims to solid studies and from doubts of its existence to convincing proof of a detrimental age-associated deficit in testosterone production. Conclusions: The history of testosterone discovery, synthesis, and introduction into the therapeutic armamentarium is an outstanding example of human curiosity, ingenuity, greed, and skepticism. Despite the vast progress in the field, many issues remain unresolved, but thoughtful science augurs well for its future.

2142,Students' Perceptions of High School Science: What has Changed Over the Last Decade?,"This paper presents comparative questionnaire data from three different samples of Australian high school students in an attempt to see if anything has changed in relation to how they perceive the science they experience in the compulsory years of secondary school (grades 7-10). Questionnaire data were obtained from 1,585 high school students in 2011 and 2,016 students in 2005 and findings are compared with those reported in a national report (Goodrum et al. 2001). Results show significant increases in the frequency with which students report that their science teacher takes notice of their ideas and in the use of computers and the Internet. There have also been changes regarding the rapid provision of feedback, the use of understandable language by teachers and the contextualisation of the new work in terms of work already covered. Little appears to have changed, however, in relation to the teacher-directed pedagogies employed to teach science where there appears to be a higher incidence of copying notes and fewer opportunities for students to investigate topics in which they are interested. The findings suggest that while there have been some positive changes, there are still many students who indicate that the science they experience in secondary school is irrelevant to their everyday life and to their future. It seems that the curiosity and wonder one would hope is associated with studying science is missing for a large proportion of students. It is clear that further actions need to be undertaken to transform this continuing situation.","Danaia, Lena and Fitzgerald, Michael and McKinnon, David",0,10.1007/s11165-012-9318-x,1523
2143,Contributions of personality dimensions to spontaneous and deliberate information processing in the guilty actions test,"The contribution of the Big-Five personality dimensions and locus of control to examinees' physiological responses in the Concealed Information polygraph Test (CIT) was examined for the first time. One hundred and twenty undergraduate students who completed Big Five personality and locus of control questionnaires were instructed to commit a mock theft. They were subsequently tested in the Guilty Actions polygraph Test, a modified version of the CIT. Each of the six sets of items (questions) was repeated twice. Results showed that introversion predicted enhanced Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs) to the critical items only for the first repetition of the first 3 questions which was explained by sensitivity to orienting responses. In contrast, extraversion was linked to Finger Pulse Waveform Length (FPWL) responses to the first repetition of the first 3 questions and was explained by extended and more deliberate information processing due to increased interest in the experiment. Participants high in openness to experience, characterized by intellectual curiosity, responded more strongly on FPWL throughout the test. Lower Neuroticism scores predicted enhanced Respiration Line Length (RLL) responses in the first repetition of the first 3 questions. Internal locus of control predicted higher tonic skin conductance level before and throughout the test. Results were explained by different information processing styles associated with these personality dimensions during various stages of the test. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

2145,Notes on the use and abuse of cultural knowledge,"When I started working as an archaeologist in Virginia in the early 1980s, we used to joke that if you wore a sign saying ""I'm an archaeologist"" you wouldn't be able to walk down the street for all the people stopping you to ask questions. I have since found similar levels of interest in other forms of anthropological inquiry, from language to cultural practices to evolutionary biology to material culture. The introductory hook is often curiosity about differences-a version of the fetishization of the exotic that one finds still even in some professional anthropologies-but it often doesn't take much to get people beyond that level to considerations of cultural-historical systems, relationships, and processes. Despite the strength of ethnocentrism in human cultures, people have strong and genuine interests in the ways and lives of others. <c2><a9> 2013 The University of Alabama Press.

2146,Review of Engaging men in couples therapy,"Reviews the book, Engaging Men in Couples Therapy edited by David S. Shepard and Michele Harway (see record 2011-01308-000). In this book, David S. Shepard and Michele Harway, with contributions from distinguished colleagues in the research and couple therapy field, offer a constructive approach to working with men in couples therapy. They believe that the male socialization process places men at a disadvantage when it comes to participating in couple therapy, which makes them more difficult to engage. Their starting point is that, according to research conducted by Gottman, the reported success rate for couple therapy is alarmingly low, with only 35% of couples reporting gains during therapy. The editors suggest that a crucial and overlooked reason for treatment failure may be that couple therapists are failing to respond to the particular needs and psychological issues of the male partner. They propose that in order to achieve ""balance"", a male-sensitive approach is required. The goal of this book is to offer a research-informed practitioner's guide to conducting male-sensitive couple therapy. It is also clearly stated that the editors, whilst acknowledging the need for male-sensitive therapy for gay couples, had decided to focus on heterosexual couples in this book. It is argued that most therapy training equip the therapist to engage female clients and that the therapy process itself capitalizes on skills that women more than men have been socialized to develop. The book is clearly structured and written in accessible language. The inclusion of different models rather than a single super-theory also encouraged integration of new ideas into existing ways of working. For practicing sexual therapists the chapter on working with male hyposexual desire disorder will be of interest and there is much in other chapters to dip into just to satisfy curiosity.

2148,Exploring the Water Uptake and Release of Mars-Relevant Salt and Surface Analogs Through Raman Microscopy,"Pure liquid water is not stable on the surface of Mars because of low pressures and temperatures. The possibility of liquid water seemed more achievable since 2008 when the Phoenix lander detected <e2><88><bc>0.5-1% perchlorate (ClO 4-) in the Martian soil. Perchlorate and chloride (Cl -) salts are of interest because they readily absorb water vapor and transition into aqueous solutions, a process called deliquescence. This thesis explores the interaction of several Martian surface analogs with water. To study the phase transitions of the Mars-relevant surface analogs, we use a Raman microscope and an environmental cell. Different combinations of salts and soil analogs were studied: pure Mg(ClO4)2, MgCl 2, CaCl2, Ca(ClO4)2, and also Mg(ClO4) 2 mixed with Mojave Mars Simulant (MMS) and montmorillonite clay. We found that Mg(ClO4)2 and MgCl2 solutions can supercool, forming ice only at higher relative humidity than the theoretical ice saturation conditions. It was also found that MgCl2 has a large hysteresis between deliquescence and recrystallization and can also form liquids below the eutectic temperature. These results suggest that brines can persist longer than predicted by thermodynamics alone, and longer than previously predicted in the literature. It was also found that the phase transitions of magnesium perchlorate were not affected by the presence of insoluble, Mars-relevant soil analogs. Using data from past and current spacecraft, it was found that aqueous solutions are predicted in the shallow subsurface of the Phoenix landing site, but not where the Curiosity rover has traversed. We also showed that MgCl2, CaCl2, Ca(ClO4)2 can hydrate (incorporate H2O into the crystal structure) without passing through a liquid phase. This helps shed light on the potential formation of chemical signatures found in recurring slope lineae, a current Martian mystery. Our previous studies have measured RH with respect to liquid (RH L), but data from Martian landers is collected as RH with respect to ice (RHi) This difference can drastically alter the interpretation of potential brine formation and some previously stated brine stability in the literature may be incorrect. However, the results in this thesis support liquid solutions existing in the subsurface at the northern regions of Mars (Phoenix landing site).","Primm, Katherine M",0,,1527

Having reviewed definitions of curiosity, the rationale for investigating curiosity within the theme of study abroad will be presented before its psychological underpinnings are explored. The development of teaching materials will then be described that were implemented in an English course conducted at a university in Japan. The course aimed to develop intercultural communicative competence (ICC) (Byram, 1997) within the Intercultural Dialogue Model (Houghton, 2012), and the study took the form of case study based on action research. Selected examples of qualitative data will be presented and discussed in relation to Loewenstein's (1994) information-gap perspective. Teachers are recommended to utilize information gaps to cause students to want to know more by encouraging them to clearly delineate information-gap boundaries and seek further information. Students need to develop meta-cognitive and meta-affective awareness and control to maintain open and inquiring minds as intrinsic aspects of criticality development. By foregrounding curiosity within the Intercultural Dialogue Model, this paper reveals active yet often missed connections between the attitudes, knowledge and critical cultural awareness components of Byram's model.

Given Limbaugh's talents and achievements, one would have thought that even his detractors would have an interest in knowing more about him such as who he is, where he came from, and why he has acquired and kept such a large and devoted following. But in fact, there has been a remarkable lack of curiosity on that score and little incentive to go beyond the sort of routine demonization that only strengthens him. The medium of talk radio has played a critical role in giving articulate shape and force to the resistance.","McClay, W M",0,,1534

2166,IS OUR SHADOW ALWAYS THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE DAY? TEACHING DIURNAL,"Nowadays perception towards science education has changed substantially, once having understood that its teaching should be carried out at classroom by using an inquiry approach and from early ages. For this purpose, it is fundamental to treat science as a natural process, in which kids explore and experiment trying to satisfy their enormous innate curiosity. In this way, it is advisable to start from children's previous conceptions and to study processes and natural phenomena that occur in their closest environment. A good example of these topics is the study of the Sun's path, which has always generated enormous curiosity since the first human civilizations, because of its importance for orientation in the time and the space. Therefore, it is not surprising that students show the same interest and fascination for the Sun, than our ancestors, since early ages. Indeed, it is very common to see how children include representations of the Sun in their drawings, being this theme the second most drawn among children from 4 to 6 years old, only behind the human figure, according to the literature. Related to this subject, in the current work we present a sequence of diurnal astronomy activities designed for Kindergarten classrooms, with ages ranging from 4 to 6 years old. The main objective to be achieved is that students become aware of the regular movements of the Sun throughout a day. For this purpose, a sequence of activities related to shadows projection is proposed as a working tool, given that the study of shadows allows us to indirectly determine the position of the Sun above the horizon at each moment of the day. This method is appropriate for young children, because of its simplicity, everydayness and because it allows direct interaction of students with sunlight, by measuring their own shadow. To achieve the main objective, several partial goals would be reached gradually, such as: to discover the origin of shadows, to realize that shadows vary during the day according to the position of the Sun and to measure the length of the shadow at different times of the day. The results of testing the sequence of activities in two groups of students, show great improvements in children relating the presence of the shadow to the existence of a source of light: either natural, like the Sun in daytime, or artificial, like a lantern or a streetlight. They also progress in connecting the shadow to the object that generates it, which means to draw the shadow starting from the base of the corresponding object.","Rosa, S and Lujan, I and Liminana, R and Nicolas, C and Menargues, A. and Martinez-Torregrosa, J",0,,1538
2167,Chinese students' science-related experiences: Comparison of the ROSE study in Xinjiang and Shanghai,"Background: Students' daily-life experiences may render favorable effects on the students' affective domain like interest, enthusiasm, motivation, joy, curiosity, awareness, and eagerness to learn science as not commonly found in the classroom environment. However, no rigorous research has been reported on those aspects in Mainland China despite many recent studies done in various Western countries. Purpose: This paper aims to report and compare the science-related experiences of ninth-graders from two places (in Urumqi City of Xinjiang province and Shanghai) in China through a large-scale survey of their junior secondary three students. Sample: The sample consists of 4115 students in Urumqi City (from 28 schools) and Shanghai (from 25 schools). Design and methods: This study adopted a Likert scale questionnaire instrument, as translated from the international Relevance Of Science Education (ROSE) Project. From a confirmatory factor analysis of the data, we identify and focus on six factors which are directly correlated with students' science-related experiences outside school environment in Xinjiang and Shanghai and employ relevant factor scores to compare the gender, regional, and socioeconomic effects. Results: As revealed by the t-test, gender and regional differences were statistically significant in affecting (1) students' outdoor living experience, (2) hands-on experience of transportation, and (3) their daily-life experience with do-it-yourself tools and models. In all three aspects, boys and Xinjiang students possessed richer experiences than girls and Shanghai students, respectively. Conclusions: Based on ANOVA tests, Shanghai students' out-of-school science-related experiences were more often significantly affected by various socioeconomic variables (including their parents' education and occupation and their family income) than Xinjiang students. From cross-regional comparison, Chinese students had much fewer science-related experiences than those of Greek and Finnish students. The limitations and educational implications of the present study are also discussed.","Yeung, Yau-yuen and Li, Yufeng",0,10.1080/02635143.2015.1028350,1539
2168,The development of focal attention and the emergence of reality,"The theory of attention is crucial for an understanding of both consciousness and repression. In developing a dynamic theory of attention, Freud formulated this insight by saying that ""the act of becoming conscious depends upon a definite psychic function-attention-being brought to bear."" Not all acts of attention, however, shed the full light of consciousness on the matter attended. For instance, something that strikes one's attention may lead to flight, to a turning away, if it arouses anxiety; and it may lead to an act of focal attention if it arouses one's curiosity. By ""focal attention,"" as distinguished from other forms of attention, I designate man's capacity to center his attention on an object fully, so that he can perceive or understand it from many sides, as clearly as possible. In this presentation, I shall attempt to show (1) that focal attention is the main instrument which, as it gradually develops, enables man to progress from the primitive mental activity of wishing or wanting (primary-process thought) to a grasp of reality (secondary-process thought); and (2) that man's grasp of reality is not merely based on his wish to satisfy primary, biological needs-is not merely, as Freud assumed, a detour on the path to wish fulfillment-but that it also has as a prerequisite an autonomous interest in the environment. Focal attention is the tool of this interest; it appears first in the child's exploratory play and requires relative freedom from need and anxiety. In discussing these topics, I shall describe the structure of acts of focal attention, briefly sketch the development of focal attention, discuss the bearing of this development on Freud's theory of repetition compulsion, and examine the basis of man's grasp of reality, reviewing critically Freud's theory of the origin and nature of thought.

The most widely used and often cited of MI integrity measures are the Motivational Interviewing Skills Code (MISC) and the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity code (MITI). These adherence tools share similar descriptive coding systems for therapist in-session behavior. MI fidelity standards are often used as reference points for therapist performance, yet practitioners rarely meet full criteria. Further, substandard ratings have been associated with positive client change. These findings have elicited questions about the necessary levels of therapist treatment adherence to promote client change and suggested the need for empirically-derived fidelity standards. This study analyzed existing data from a sample of Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) sessions from Project MATCH (Matching Alcohol Treatments to Client Heterogeneity) that were audio recorded and previously coded with the MISC. MI adherence variables were analyzed along with client drinking outcomes to test the relationship between therapist fidelity and client change. Therapist adherence was determined using behavioral codes common to the MITI and MISC. Client change thresholds were determined using clinically significant change standards developed by Jacobson and Truax. The relationships between therapist adherence level and client change thresholds were examined using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Findings showed mixed support for the relationship between therapist adherence level and client drinking outcomes, but yielded levels of therapist MI adherence associated with client changes in drinking outcomes.

2174,Reclaiming science: Evidence and truth in the age of persuasion,"Reviews the book, Reclaiming childhood: Freedom and play in an age of fear by Helene Guldberg (see record 2008-17614-000). In this book, the author addresses topics that are of great interest to parents, educators, and researchers. The take-home message of the book is that children in the United Kingdom and the United States today are worse off than were children from the last two generations because of societal shifts toward overprotection. Helicopter parenting, unreasonable safety requirements, and out-of-proportion fears regarding stranger danger, bullying, and Internet predators have led to a ""cocooning"" of children that deprives them of experiences that foster resiliency, curiosity, and self-efficacy. It is peculiar that we, both parents and developmental psychologists, were more likely to agree with this statement before we read the book than after reading the book. We chose to review this book, in part, so that we could become aware of the science that undergirds this claim. While it does, indeed, seem that children today are being partially paralyzed by fear-based parenting and overprotective policies, this book fails to convince us of that. The misuse of science and the clumsy attempt at persuasion leave us wondering whether and how children today are faring, given the changing sociohistorical realities they face.

2175,"Beauty is Precious, Knowledge is Power, and Innovation is Progress: Widely Held Beliefs in Policy Narratives about Oil Spills","Scholars from diverse perspectives have sought to understand the features and mechanisms that influence the design and implementation of public policy. Some (realists) have emphasized the role that material interests have played while others (idealists) have emphasized the influence of subjective ideas on <e2><80><98>how policy means<e2><80><99> (Yanow 1996). Recently, observers in both camps have demonstrated curiosity in the influence of culture on policymaking and its consequences. Regrettably, this shared concern has not resulted in much collaboration across epistemological divides. I argue that narrative analysis provides a way to bridge the divides by specifying an interpretive approach that identifies culture as encompassing both interests and ideas in policymaking processes. I draw from the works of scholars in phenomenology, narratology, cultural sociology, disaster studies and public policy to illustrate a systematic approach to investigating and interpreting congressional hearings as narratives that reveal cultural taken-for-granted assumptions about how the world should work (Loseke 2003). I argue that examining narratives of political actors can empirically delineate both objective interests as well as subjective ideas. In particular, I compare and contrast diverse stories about three U.S. oil spills (Santa Barbara, Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon) to illuminate taken-for-granted beliefs about our social and natural worlds. With this emphasis, I aim to contribute to understandings of how culture works in policymaking, which also sheds light on how culture may influence the wider social order more generally. I conclude with a discussion of potential implications regarding our shared natural resources.","Mason, Brenda Gale",0,,1546

2179,CONFRONTING THE ADVISABILITY OF IMPLEMENTING VIRTUAL LABS FOR ONLINE,"In the sciences, the standard vehicle for teaching practical skills is the laboratory course, where the students have the opportunity to engage with real lab equipment, to analyze authentic data, to experience the excitement of observation and to reinforce the curiosity and intuition. Bringing such experiences online is tricky, but new and rapidly evolving education-technology tools make possible now to do problem-focused learning way better. A huge body of evidence suggests that a completely virtual lab can never fully replace time at the bench; it must be used as a supplementary aid. That is why we created a Java physics applet to study some properties of light using a geometrical triangular prism. The user can control different materials for the prism as well as its apex angle and the change of the wavelength of the incident light beam. And, for example, with the incident light beam adjusted such that the refracted beam is at minimum deviation, the refractive index can then be computed using the apex angle and the angle of minimum deviation. It is important to notice that such a virtual lab is heavily influenced by the philosophy of enquiry-based learning which puts students to work in teams, challenges them with a question and lets them struggle to find their own answer in a collaborative way. We have also considered very important to open the source code of our virtual lab to interested users, in order to widespread adoption of virtual labs and try to avoid that so many are one-off experiments which are simply stored in obscure websites where almost nobody can find them.","Fernandez-Alonso, M and Martinez-Leon, L and Lancis, J and Tajahuerce, E and Minguez-Vega, G and Duran, V and Climent, V and Ferriols, N S and Perez-Vizcaino, J and Clemente, P and Mendoza-Yero, O and Campos-Abad, D and Pons-Marti, A",0,,1549
2181,"Play, creativity, and movement vocabulary","In this chapter, Pat Odgen addresses the somatic, or body, side of things. She suggests that to be creative, we must extend beyond our comfort zone in order to take risks and push past the confines of the familiar. Yet, as creatures of habit, we humans also love to sink into routine and thrive in the comfort of the familiar. In general, the more secure we feel in our bodies, minds, and relationships, the wider our window of affect tolerance, and the more inclined we will feel to stretch beyond our usual boundaries. The author presents five basic movements which underlie more complex sequences: yielding, pushing, reaching, grasping, and pulling. We yield to let go-into each other, into gravity, and into the comfort of our beds. We yield to open up to playful promptings and creative products of the unconscious mind. We push upon solid foundations: the fetus pushes out of the womb; we push to differentiate self from other and to push away that which offends, disgusts, or violates our boundaries. We reach to go beyond ourselves, often out of desire to connect with people or objects in the environment. Reaching manifests openness, interest, and curiosity-all ways to say ""yes"" to novel experience. We grasp to take hold of what we desire, gaining the opportunity to explore it further with multiple senses. Finally, we pull objects and people we desire closer, beginning in infancy with the nipple. Pulling epitomizes the positive, intrinsic motivation necessary for play and creativity.

2183,Investigating public science interest and understanding: Evidence for the importance of free-choice learning,"Historically, most of the focus of science education has been on pre-college and college level schooling. Although some of the public's interest and knowledge about science is unquestionably shaped by compulsory schooling, given that the average adult spends only a fraction of their life participating in some kind of formal schooling, we argue that the contribution of school-based science learning to the long-term public understanding of science is limited, particularly for the majority of Americans who do not go on to post-secondary schooling. This article shows that the majority of the public constructs much of its understanding of science over the course of their lives, gathering information from many places and contexts, and for a diversity of reasons. A random telephone survey of Los Angeles, California residents found that nearly half (43 percent) of the public's self-reported science understanding derives from leisure time, free-choice learning; science understanding was primarily acquired for reasons related to personal interest, need and/or curiosity. The conclusion drawn from this preliminary investigation is that future efforts to understand and support the public's understanding of science will require approaches that take into account individual differences and the unique personal and context-specific nature of knowledge; findings also support the value of asset-based approaches to education which build from strengths rather than dwelling upon deficits. <c2><a9> SAGE Publications.","Falk, J H and Storksdieck, M and Dierking, L D",0,10.1177/0963662506064240,1552

It is a frequent consequence of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although various scoring methods have been proposed, there is a lack of validated, standardised instruments for detecting apathy and assessing its severity. Objective: To develop an apathy rating scale using a structured standardised interview capable of distinguishing between the condition's various features. Methods: The Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) is based on a structured interview. It includes 33 items, divided into nine domains. Responses are scored on a dichotomous scale. The participants used to validate the scale consisted of 159 patients with probable Parkinson's disease and 58 healthy control subjects. The Marin Apathy Scale, the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale were also administered. Results: Principal component analysis showed that the LARS probed a single construct which forms the root of an oblique factor structure reflecting four dimensions: intellectual curiosity, self awareness, emotion, and action initiation. The main psychometric properties of the LARS (internal consistency, inter-rater and test-retest reliability) were satisfactory. Concurrent validity was evaluated by reference to the Marin scale and to judgements provided by expert clinicians. Conclusions: Standard validity indices showed that the LARS is sensitive and capable of distinguishing between apathy and depression. As a screening tool, the scale is able to support dichotomous judgements accurately and, when greater measurement sensitivity is required, also determine the severity of apathy within a four category classification.

Our findings have implications for learning about the temporal dynamics of pregnancy-related interests and concerns, and also for the design of systems that tailor their responses to point estimates of each searcher's current stage in pregnancy.","Fourney, Adam and White, Ryen W and Horvitz, Eric",0,10.1145/2702123.2702427,1558
2194,Excavating the eternal: An indigenous archaeological tradition in India,"Archaeological investigation in India begins conventionally with the interest of Europeans. But India's own historical texts reveal examples of indigenous, curiosity-driven fieldwork as early as the sixteenth century. Describing the systematic search for lost sacred images and sites in places associated with Krishna's earthly pastimes, the author makes a spirited case for regarding this activity as real archaeology, comparing it with today's heritage projects.","Cremo, M A",0,10.1017/S0003598X00096538,1559
2195,Seeking through the small screen: Television as a resource for negotiating and constructing personal spirituality,"One of the noted changes in religious behaviour in North Atlantic societies, has been the movement away from traditional institutionalized religions and towards non-institutional religion and personal forms of spirituality often characterized by individuals' mix and match various religious and secular ideas, beliefs and practices in order to form personal forms of 'religion' (Luckmann 1967; Bibby 1987, 1991, 2001; Roof 1993, 1999; Wuthnow 1998; Zinnbauer 1999; Heelas 2002; Heelas and Woodhead 2005). Such trends then beg the questions, specifically how are people constructing their personal religions? Are there common resources helping to shape and influence individual's personal forms of spirituality? How are elements such as individualism, consumerism and communication and information technologies impacting upon and reflected in contemporary religious practices? Inspired by these research questions, this thesis investigates how television functions as a cultural resource for negotiating and constructing personal forms of spirituality. Using in-depth interviews with 30 research participants this project examines how self-identified 'spiritual' individuals define and describe the relationship between their spirituality and their television viewing. Combing insights from sociological literature examining contemporary spirituality, with the research participants' definitions and descriptions of spirituality, I come to interpret spirituality as both a product and a process; that is, spirituality as 'specific beliefs and practices' and spirituality as 'the act of learning, thinking, talking about transcendent meaning' (Besecke 2002; 2005). The term 'transcendent' as it is used in this context refers to the postulation by individuals or collectives, that there is some form of reality and meaning outside, beyond or underneath every day, objective reality (Luckmann, 1967:58; Berger 1969:53; Wuthnow 1976:71; Dawson 1987:228; Besecke 2005:183). Based on this understanding of spirituality as product and process, I argue that television programs play a role in cultural dialogues about transcendent meaning, offering a platform through which viewers reflexively explore a variety of spiritual themes, topics and issues. To support this argument, I present interview data demonstrating how the participants in this study use television programs as way to help define what counts as spirituality; to shape and inform their spiritual beliefs, general worldviews and concepts of morality; to foster curiosity, learning and open-mindedness; as an outlet for working through different possibilities, options and potential forms of ultimate meaning, as evidence of ii transcendent reality; and importantly, as a way to satisfy their interest in spirituality. Further, I argue that participants use television as a resource for a particular form of spiritual consumption as they continuously seek out both new and more information, knowledge, and ideas related to an assortment of religious, spiritual and transcendent themes.

2196,Consistency and change in personality characteristics and affect from middle to late adolescence,"59 nonclinical adolescents were examined at ages 16 and 18 yrs to see whether or not there were changes in personality functioning, attitudes, and affect over time and whether or not these were related to each other. Personality functioning remained fairly consistent at both ages, with marked personality problems occurring in about 1 out of 7 Ss. As a group, Ss at 18 yrs of age demonstrated more anxiety and depression and changes in attitudes such as more curiosity and interest in people. For individual Ss, there was considerable predictability of affect and attitudes at age 18 yrs from the presentation at age 16 yrs. A relative increase in the amount of anger in middle adolescence was a predictor of personality problems in late adolescence.

2197,Joachim Friedrich Wohlwill (1928-1987),"Joachim (Jack) F. Wohlwill was a well known developmental psychologist who spent some time at Clark University as director of its graduate program in developmental psychology. Jack's concern with the environment became manifest in 1963 when he accepted an invitation to spend the year as a Fellow in the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences. Jack's contributions to the study of environment and behavior are extensive, varied, and creative. With Irwin Airman and others, he edited books covering the environment in relation to children, elderly people, culture, the social sciences, and transportation behavior, as well as the impact of the natural environment on behavior. Jack's concern for developmental psychology remained as a potent force. In 1979, while still at Pennsylvania State, he became Professor of Human Development in the Programs on Individual and Family Studies and Man-Environment Relations. Related to his interests in developmental and environmental psychology was Jack's long-standing interest in the psychology of the arts and in the work of Daniel Berlyne on exploration, curiosity, and affective arousal, along with their roles in both the creation of and response to artistic stimuli. This interest in the psychology of the arts brought him back in formal contact with Clark University's Heinz Werner Institute for Developmental Analysis in 1986. Here he helped initiate a conference on ""Development and the Arts,"" in which he was scheduled to present his work on ""Effects of Media on the Creativity of Children's Art.""

2198,Intrinsically motivated intelligent sensed environments,"Intelligent rooms comprise hardware devices that support human activities in a room and software that has some level of control over the devices. ``Intelligent'' implies that the room is considered to behave in an intelligent manner or includes some aspect of artificial intelligence in its implementation. The focus of this paper is intelligent sensed environments, including rooms or interactive spaces that display adaptive behaviour through learning and motivation. We present motivated agent models that incorporate machine learning in which the motivation component eliminates the need for a benevolent teacher to prepare problem specific reward functions or training examples. Our model of motivation is based on concepts of ``curiosity'', ``novelty'' and ``interest''. We explore the potential for this model through the implementation of a curious place.","Maher, Mary Lou and Merrick, Kathryn and Macindoe, Owen",0,,1563

The goal of STEAM also is to increase the problem-solving skill based convergence thinking. So, in this study, I proposed a study program of the STEAM by RST(Reverse Science from Technology) for improving problem-solving skills. The topics are hi-tech products which are the convergence product of Science, technology, culture and art like Refrigerators and mobile phones. This program is starting from the exciting technology and conversely learning basic science, mathematics, art and etc. That learns technology in high-tech products which were subject of curiosity, and then learn mathematics and science, which are the basis of the technology. So, learners will learn how to use basic studies to their life and it increases understanding of course content as well as the interest in learning. Also, that provides learning opportunity of Language art by utilizing writing in the learning process and learners can recognize and solve problem on their own to found and modify their thinking.","Jeon, S R and Kim, S H and Nam, D S and Lee, T W",0,,1565
2203,Mexican Menâ€™s View of Vasectomy,"The present study explored the views of Mexican men concerning vasectomy. One hundred and five men who had not had a vasectomy were asked to complete the following phrase <e2><80><9c>If you no longer wanted to have more children and a vasectomy was suggested, you would react with.. or you would think.. <e2><80><9d> with at least five different answers. Participants then had to rank each of their answers according to how well they describe the participant<e2><80><99>s feelings in the hypothetical situation. The results were analyzed using the Natural Semantic Networks Technique. The most common words used by participants with a limited educational background were reject, followed by fear and anger, and they did not use any words that implied acceptance of vasectomy. In contrast, the most common words used by participants with higher education were curiosity, followed by acceptance and interest; however, they also used the words fear and insecurity. The most frequent attitudes reported by men with limited education were negative, whereas participants with a higher education reported more ambivalent attitudes. These findings are discussed in light of sociocultural features and could be helpful in designing reproductive health programs with more effective counseling to diminish negative views about vasectomy. <c2><a9> 2016, <c2><a9> The Author(s) 2016.","Marv<c3><a1>n, M L and Ehrenzweig, Y and Hern<c3><a1>ndez-Aguilera, D",0,10.1177/1557988316655743,1566
2204,"A Social Curiosity Inspired Recommendation Model to Improve Precision, Coverage and Diversity","With the prevalence of social networks, social recommendation is rapidly gaining popularity. Currently, social information has mainly been utilized for enhancing rating prediction accuracy, which may not be enough to satisfy user needs. Items with high prediction accuracy tend to be the ones that users are familiar with and may not interest them to explore. In this paper, we take a psychologically inspired view to recommend items that will interest users based on the theory of social curiosity and study its impact on important dimensions of recommender systems. We propose a social curiosity inspired recommendation model which combines both user preferences and user curiosity. The proposed recommendation model is evaluated using large-scale real world datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that the inclusion of social curiosity significantly improves recommendation precision, coverage and diversity.","Wu, Qiong and Liu, Siyuan and Miao, Chunyan and Liu, Yuan and Leung, Cyril",0,10.1109/WI.2016.41,1567
2206,"Masters of mathematics: The problems they solved, why these are important, and what you should know about them","The original title for this work was Mathematical Literacy, What Is It and Why You Need it. The current title reflects that there can be no real learning in any subject, unless questions of who, what, when, where, why and how are raised in the minds of the learners. The book is not a mathematical text, and there are no assigned exercises or exams. It is written for reasonably intelligent and curious individuals, both those who value mathematics, aware of its many important applications and others who have been inappropriately exposed to mathematics, leading to indifference to the subject, fear and even loathing. These feelings are all consequences of meaningless presentations, drill, rote learning and being lost as the purpose of what is being studied.Mathematics education needs a radical reform. There is more than one way to accomplish this. Here the author presents his approach of wrapping mathematical ideas in a story. To learn one first must develop an interest in a problem and the curiosity to find how masters of mathematics have solved them. What is necessary to be mathematically literate? Its not about solving algebraic equations or even making a geometric proof. These are valuable skills but not evidence of literacy. We often seek answers but learning to ask pertinent questions is the road to mathematical literacy. Here is the good news: new mathematical ideas have a way of finding applications. This is known as the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. <c2><a9> 2017 Sense Publishers. All Rights Reserved.","Nowlan, R A",0,10.1007/978-94-6300-893-8,1568
2209,Philip M. Strong (1945-1995): An appreciation of an essayist,"Phil Strong died in London, suddenly, on 11 July 1995 aged only 49. One of the post-war generation of sociologists, he was prominent throughout the period of the dramatic growth of British medical sociology that began at the end of the sixties. Well-known for his wide-ranging intellectual curiosity about illness and identity, health professions and organisational life, he developed a commitment to multi-disciplinary working at the same time as retaining a lasting interest in, and dialogue with, the work of Erving Goffman. My commission to write an appreciative essay of his work as a medical sociologist is impossible to execute adequately - for the simple reason that his death robbed us of our most accomplished essayist. Strong himself wrote entertainingly on the essayist's craft in an extraordinary review of Goffman's Forms of Talk in Sociology (Strong 19821), 'extraordinary' because it contrived to instruct and illuminate while simultaneously ignoring most of the rules of good reviewing practice. His practice as an essayist is one to which I will return. First, I wish to record his achievements in other fields.","Bloor, M",0,10.1111/1467-9566.ep10939129,1569
2211,"Book second. Development of stature, weight, strength, &c","Apparently but little interest is attached to the determination of the stature and weight of man, or to his physical development at different ages; nor, until the present time, has any one particularly attended to this subject. Man has only been studied in his most conspicuous relations; the correlative study of his qualities, and the numerical determination of the modifications which are consequent upon age, have been neglected. This state of things leaves immense voids in science, and the result is that we generally want the necessary means for solving a great number of interesting questions, especially relating to the natural history of man. For example, we are almost totally ignorant of the ratios which may exist between the laws of development of his different faculties, and what are the elements which predominate at such or such an age: hence the critical periods of life can only be determined in a very indefinite manner. The researches which have been made to measure the height and weight of man, especially relate either to the period of birth or to the period of complete development; but the intermediate ages have scarcely been attended to. Physiologists have connected the first of these determinations with a question in legal medicine; they have even anticipated the period of birth, and sought to value the size and weight of the fetus. Natural philosophers, who studied man as a mechanical agent, have rather been occupied with the determination of his weight when he has acquired complete development. La Hire has made some very remarkable researches of this kind, which prove that the subject now occupying us has a much deeper interest than that resulting from mere curiosity.

2212,DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE TECHNICAL-SCIENTIFIC AND POPULAR KNOWLEDGE,"It's not possible to think of promoting health without education. For this reason, it's desirable that the social practices in this field always seek greater approximation and interchange. In all society, health care ways are normally measured by informal and institutional educational processes presented in social relations. Many professionals ignore the fact that they educate even when they do not have such intention, while others reproduce a vertical and depersonalized educative action based on a restricted comprehension of health as lack of disease and of education as mere information transmission. The objective of the present study is to promote the dialogue between the technical-scientific knowledge and the popular one acquired by the elderly. The work was developed with 60 elder people members of the Pastoral of the Elderly group in Petropolis neighborhood, Manaus, Amazon, Brazil. The intent was to develop a Popular Education in Health methodology starting from the idea that the promotion of elderly health is constructed with them, and not for them, involving in this process experiences able to stimulate critical reflections in the elderly about themselves and their reality. Conversation circles were performed weekly by the own elderly during nine months, with various topics chosen by them. leaflets and conversation circles were carried out, in which the own elderly collaborated with the choice of subjects taking into consideration the necessity of their fellows. It was observed that the themes of greatest interest were: abuse and elderly rights. The information became relevant for their daily lives, incentivizing change of habits and improving knowledge about health and quality of life for them and their family. The interaction with the group of elderly allowed to raise curiosity, uneasiness and popular knowledge related to the practice of healthy habits as well as issues demanded by the elderly. The conversation circle allowed a greater intergenerational bond, in which young students and the elderly exchanged experience, strengthening the respect that must exist among generations.","de Souza Ribeiro, Maria de Nazare and de Souza Ribeiro Joaquim Hudson and and da Silva Fonseca, Samanta Kerima and Campos, Francileia Costa and Diniz, Cleisiane Xavier and de Castro, Fernanda Farias and Perdomo, Selma Barboza",0,,1571
2214,STUDYING THE IMPACT ON MECHANICAL ENGINEERING STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE,"This paper summarizes two projects which were created in 2001 and incorporated within a Thermodynamics and Advanced Thermodynamics course. Intended learning outcomes of the projects include strengthening Thermodynamics related knowledge; improving communication abilities, and strengthening intellectual curiosity in areas related to thermodynamics and mechanical engineering, in general. The focus of this paper is on the framework development to measure certain effects that project participation may have had on student participants. In 2001, the projects were introduced and over the past nine years, each project has been refined through assessment in order to improve student learning while achieving intended learning outcomes. The two projects which were designed to prolong and strengthen students' interest in areas related to thermodynamics. The first project is an individual project within Thermodynamics which requires students to critically read a technical book related to Thermodynamics, technically review the book in written form, and orally present results to the class in an informal setting. The second is a team-based project within Advanced Thermodynamics which requires student teams to create and present a class-long presentation for a non-technical audience. The content of the presentation must strongly relate to Thermodynamics and have direct relevance to the audience. Past student teams have presented to a variety of audiences ranging from college level liberal arts classes to middle and high school science, math, and technology classes. This paper includes a brief background of both projects with project rationale, past assessment results, and discussions on project refinement. A key element of the paper is the development of an enhanced assessment strategy to measure impact associated with participation on the team-based presentation project. An indirect measure involving focus groups is also introduced and administered on a pilot basis with sample results presented.","Bailey, Margaret B",0,,1572

2217,From virtual to real: Video games in the treatment of boys,"Presently, the video game industry is marking a growing presence in the multimedia business, with dozens of ways for consumers to be impacted by their products. People have access to video games for use on televisions, telephones, and the home/office computer, while they also come in the form of handheld game systems and game decks. Children of all demographics are playing these games. They could be using computer-based educational programs, dedicated education systems like Leap FrogTM, handheld systems like Nintendo DS, sports games, or racing games, or playing Sudoku on one of the various types of smart phones. All of these games represent potential interfaces with the child; they can and often do serve as a conduit for connection. For therapists, this media can be a single-sided event that excludes them or a true opportunity for mutual interaction. With an understanding of the subject matter and some creativity, clinicians will be able to expand these opportunities for meeting boys where they are and fostering a meaningful dialogue in service of therapeutic progress. While multiple studies conclude that the repeated playing of violent video games can lead to an increase in violent behavior, these games remain a much-loved part of many boys' lives. It is important for clinicians to remember that many games that capture boys' interest are not violent in nature, and most of the studies related to the harmful effects of video games are restricted to those with violent content (Gentile, 2010). Like anything, these games are a tool. If used in excess, they have the potential to be destructive and lead to significant problems. But when used with forethought and careful monitoring, they can assist the therapist in drawing in those boys who initially appear guarded, closed, and reluctant to engage in the treatment process. Video games can provide not only a powerful relationship development tool but also a mechanism for experiential learning and metaphorical discussion. Clinicians can learn a great deal from their clients about video games, if they lack experience with them. This reversal of the power differential inherent to the treatment relationship allows the client to instead be the expert while the therapist models openness in the face of not having all the answers. Entering into these games with curiosity and openness may help us assist boys in building relationships, skills, and insight in the virtual world that can become the catalyst for the development of these same positive benefits in the real world.

2220,Evaluating a motivational freshman course,"Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute has developed an elective laboratory course intended to motivate freshmen for further study of engineering in general and to spur interest in electrical and computer engineering in particular. The course philosophy is that hands-on laboratory and design experiences will build student confidence, stimulate curiosity, and demonstrate the relevance of engineering work. These, in turn, should increase motivation and retention. To assess the impact of this course, a multi-dimensional evaluation process has been conducted consisting of: (1) attitudinal surveys of the students at the end of the course; (2) structured interviews with students in the course; (3) surveys of the students in a subsequent design course; (4) pretests and posttests of student creativity. Evaluation results indicate that carefully structured hands-on experience is an effective way of motivating freshman for further engineering study. The results also indicate that the course has increased student creativity and confidence in their abilities. Furthermore, the improvements in motivation and confidence can still be measured in subsequent semesters. Thus, since the new course is just a one-credit laboratory, it appears possible to address the problem of motivating engineering freshmen with only a modest impact on already crowded first-year programs.","Carlson, Bruce and Schoch, Paul and Kalsher, Michael and Racicot, Bernadette",0,,1575

2222,"Research Says/Curiosity Is Fleeting, but Teachable","Psychologists and researchers have long puzzled over questions regarding ""curiosity"" and have more or less settled on a two-pronged definition as: (1) trait curiosity (an intrinsic drive for exploration and learning); and (2) state curiosity (an interest sparked by external conditions). Many studies have shown that human beings are generally born with a drive to explore their environments, and longitudinal studies conducted with young children have found wide variance in stimulation seeking (the drive to investigate new objects in their environments). The early research findings seem to suggest that curiosity is more nature than nurture. However, dozens of newer studies have discovered that environmental conditions profoundly influence children's openness to exploration. So, the question arises, what classroom conditions arouse curiosity? For starters, curiosity begins with the encounter of a gap in knowledge, especially something that does not fit ones expectations. Since curiosity depends on some prior knowledge, teachers should draw on students' prior knowledge of subjects/events to arouse their curiosity.","Goodwin, Bryan",0,,1577

Teachers committed to this approach need to spend time planning, executing, and evaluating the process and to bring the following essential components to the classroom: (1) love and respect for children, (2) love of both adult and children's books, (3) willingness to share reading with children and to listen to their comments, (4) imagination and curiosity, and (5) time and flexibility. Students can benefit from class projects assisted by a librarian. By reviewing such sources as ""Children's Catalog"" and ""The Horn Book,"" the librarian can assemble a selection of books from various genres addressing different aspects of the subject being studied. The class should be consulted for ideas. Biographical information on the authors can be provided. Weekly vocabulary lists can be developed from the readings and teachers and students can keep logs to record comments about the learning experience.

2225,When I grow up: the relationship of science learning activation to STEM career preferences,"This paper proposes three new measures of components STEM career preferences (affinity, certainty, and goal), and then explores which dimensions of science learning activation (fascination, values, competency belief, and scientific sensemaking) are predictive of STEM career preferences. Drawn from the ALES14 dataset, a sample of 2938 sixth and eighth grade middle-school students from 11 schools in two purposefully selected diverse areas (Western Pennsylvania & the Bay Area of California) was used for the analyses presented in this paper. These schools were chosen to represent socio-economic and ethnic diversity. Findings indicate that, overall, youth who are activated towards science learning are more likely to have affinity towards STEM careers, certainty about their future career goals, and have identified a specific STEM career goal. However, different dimensions of science learning activation are more strongly correlated with different aspects career preference across different STEM career foci (e.g. science, engineering, technology, health, etc.). Gender, age, minority status, and home resources also have explanatory power. While many results are consistent with prior research, there are also novel results that offer important fodder for future research. Critically, our strategy of measuring affinity towards the specific disciplines that make up STEM, measuring STEM and health career goals separately, and looking at career affinity and career goals separately, offers interesting results and underscores the value of disentangling the conceptual melting pot of what has previously been known as career interest.' Study findings also have implications for design of science learning opportunities for youth.","Dorph, Rena and Bathgate, Meghan E and Schunn, Christian D and Cannady, Matthew A",0,10.1080/09500693.2017.1360532,1580
2226,Kids & Family Reading Reportâ„¢. 6th Edition,"This report presents the 6th Edition of Scholastic's biannual study of children's and parents' attitudes and behaviors about reading. The latest research touches on: (1) Reading Books for Fun; (2) Reading Aloud; (3) Summer Reading; and (4) Favorite Children's Books. This research provides both reasons to celebrate as well as a strong motivation to continue working to ensure that all children are able to read the books they love every day. Among the most positive findings is the impact of the recent movement to encourage families to begin reading aloud to their children at birth and to keep going as their children get older. Previously, Scholastic found 30% of parents with children ages 0-5 reported reading to their child before three months old. Today, 40% of parents do. The percentage of families reading aloud to young children 5-7 days a week has also increased among families with kids ages 3-5 (55% to 62%), yet it was found that many parents read less often to children older than 5, with another steep drop-off occurring at age 8. While starting to read aloud early matters, it is known that having books at home also makes a difference in kids' reading lives. The report verifies that the homes of frequent readers have far more children's books than the homes of infrequent readers, and a similar disparity exists in low-income homes and the homes of African-American and Hispanic families. This is a strong call to action to ensure to work hard to get books into the hands of every child. Scholastic also wanted to better understand what diversity in children's books means to parents, as well as what types of characters kids and parents look for in kids' books. Parents shared with that when they consider the meaning of diversity in books for children and teens, they believe these books include ""people and experiences different than those of their child"" (73%), ""various cultures, customs or religions"" (68%), ""differently-abled people"" (51%), ""people of color"" (47%), and ""LGBTQ people"" (21%). Scholastic also found about one in 10 kids look for characters who are differently-abled (13%), are culturally or ethnically diverse (11%), and who break stereotypes (11%). Hispanic and African-American families express more interest in diverse books than non-Hispanic and non-African-American families. Many people working in schools and education are aware of the academic skills lost over the summer when children are out of school, but in this edition of the Kids & Family Reading Report Scholastic found that only 48% of parents have heard of the summer slide, a percentage that decreases to 38% among lower-income families. Even as kids tell that, contrary to popular belief, they enjoy summer reading and believe it is important, they need more support and access to books. On average, one in five 12-17 year-olds and one in five kids in lower-income families do not read any books at all over the summer. While the report reveals that many kids continue to have trouble finding books they like, parents underestimate this challenge. Only 29% of parents agree ""my child has trouble finding books he/she likes,"" whereas 41% of kids agree--57% among infrequent readers vs. 26% of frequent readers. Fortunately, the data in the report can offer guidance on where kids and families get great ideas about books to read for fun. Literacy empowers children to explore, communicate, debate and think critically.

2229,A Strategy for Incorporating Students' Interests Into the High-School Science Classroom,"Many students feel the curriculum is detached from their lives and interests. Indeed, about half the questions asked by high school biology students are not addressed by the curriculum. This study presents a strategy to incorporate students' curiosity questions into the curriculum as a way to reduce the disparity between students' interests and curricular requirements. We examined how five high school teachers incorporate their students' questions into their teaching and students' perspectives on and experience of learning this way. In all classes, students were invited to anonymously write down their questions on the next topics to be learned and hand them in to the teacher, who mapped the questions into the required curriculum and planned teaching to address these questions. Teachers were given a freehand concerning how the questions were to be answered. This resulted in five different pedagogies ranging from teacher-centered to students-centered and different levels to which students' voices affected the lesson content. There was no commonality between the level of adaptation of teaching content to include students' voice and the choice of student-centered pedagogies. The three basic needs identified by the Self-Determination Theory were addressed, hence potentially increasing students' intrinsic motivation. It enabled almost all the students to ask questions and influence lesson content; in some cases, an unintended outcome of improving teacher-student and peer to peer relations was observed. We suggest a practical, accessible, and flexible way to integrate students' existing interests in science with disciplinary science learning, governed by the respect for their autonomy and needs. If the curriculum does not provide for personal queries, teachers can make this possible by incorporating students' questions into the curriculum and negotiating a shared shadow curriculum.

2237,A Preschool Investigation: The Skyscraper Project,"Young children thrive in classrooms that allow them to explore and discover their environment and interests and also support them in this learning. Because children learn best when they are interested and excited, early-childhood educators should offer children play-based, integrated mathematical experiences (NRC 2009). In this article, the authors describe a meaningful project-based learning experience that intrinsically invites problem solving and mathematical thinking in a preschool classroom. Project-based learning is a learner-driven approach to teaching in which children investigate significant, real-world ideas or problems. Early-childhood, project-based learning allows children to learn through exploring their world of play and further investigate their curiosities and interests.","McCormick, Kelly K and Twitchell, Guinevere",0,,1586
2238,The hungry mind: The origins of curiosity in childhood,"Despite American education's recent mania for standardized tests, testing misses what really matters about learning: the desire to learn in the first place. Curiosity is vital, but it remains a surprisingly understudied characteristic. The Hungry Mind is a deeply researched, highly readable exploration of what curiosity is, how it can be measured, how it develops in childhood, and how it can be fostered in school. Children naturally possess an active interest in knowing more about the world around them. But what begins as a robust trait becomes more fragile over time, and is shaped by experiences with parents, teachers, peers, and the learning environment. Susan Engel highlights the centrality of language and question-asking as crucial tools for expressing' curiosity. She also uncovers overlooked forms of curiosity, such as gossip-an important way children satisfy their interest in other people. Although curiosity leads to knowledge, it can stir up trouble, and schools too often have an incentive to squelch it in favor of compliance and discipline. Balanced against the interventions of hands-on instructors and hovering parents, Engel stresses the importance of time spent alone, which gives children a chance to tinker, collect, read about the things that interest them, and explore their own thoughts. In addition to providing a theoretical framework for the psychology of curiosity, The Hungry Mind offers educators practical ways to put curiosity at the center of the classroom and encourage children's natural eagerness to learn.

2240,Assessment of Response to Mindfulness Meditation: Meditation Breath Attention Scores in Association with Subjective Measures of State and Trait Mindfulness and Difficulty Letting Go of Depressive Cognition,"How best to operationalize the mindfulness construct requires further research. In two related studies, we examined undergraduates' self-reported ability to maintain their attention toward the process of their breathing during 10- and 15-min practices of mindful breath meditation, referred to as ""Meditation Breath Attention Scores"" (MBAS). MBAS were positively correlated with self-reported interest in and awareness of the breath during both 10- and 15-min meditations and negatively correlated with self-reported difficulties maintaining attention toward breathing (i. e., mind wandering) during the 15-min meditation. MBAS were not positively correlated with the Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS) measures of mindful ""decentering"" and ""curiosity."" In study 2 but not study 1, MBAS were positively correlated with the five-factor mindfulness trait ""Acting with Awareness."" Secondary analyses replicated an association between measures of trait mindfulness and trait difficulty letting go of depressive thoughts, although MBAS and the TMS measures were unrelated with trait difficulty letting go of depressive thoughts.

2241,Parents' expectations of the junior school,"In May and June i960 a survey was made of attitudes to and expectations of the school among parents of children in the last two years of two junior schools in a Midland City. Children of this age (10 and 11 years) were chosen on the assumption that parental interest and curiosity would be at their height, and views on education most fully developed, in this period immediately preceding secondary selection. A random sample of one in four names was taken from the school registers with a view to interviewing the parents of these children. The homes of 26 children in school B were approached and interviews were carried out in 22; the homes of 62 children in school A were approached and interviews were carried out in 50. Thus one or both parents of 22 children (14 boys and 8 girls) were interviewed: 18 fathers and 22 mothers, a total of 40 parents. Altogether 132 parents in the two areas were interviewed, representing 72 children (36 boys and 36 girls). Both groups of parents were equally satisfied or dissatisfied with the content and emphasis of the school curriculum, but whereas middle-class parents considered that academic-verbal-literary subjects were neglected, parents on the estate tended to allege that practical physical- applied subjects and activities were neglected. This was probably a more accurate reflection of parental interests and preoccupations than of the condition of the schools concerned.

2242,Cultivating the social-emotional imagination in gifted education: insights from educational neuroscience,"Evidence from education, psychology, and neuroscience suggests that investing in the development of the social-emotional imaginationis essential to cultivating giftedness in adolescents. Nurturing these capacities may be especially effective for promoting giftedness in students who are likely to lose interest and ambition over time. Giftedness is frequently equated with high general intelligence as measured by IQ tests, but this narrow conceptualization does not adequately capture students' abilities to utilize their talents strategically to fully realize their future possible selves. The brain's default mode network is thought to play an important role in supporting imaginative thinking about the self and others across time. Because this network's functioning is temporarily attenuated when individuals engage in task-and action-oriented focus (mindsets thought to engage the brain's executive attention network), we suggest that consistently focusing students on tasks requiring immediate action could undermine long-term cultivation of giftedness. We argue that giftedness-especially in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-can be cultivated by encouraging adolescents' intellectual curiosity and supporting their ability to connect schoolwork to a larger purpose. Improving STEM and gifted education may depend upon a shift from knowledge transmission and regimented evaluation to creative exploration, intentional reflectiveness, and mindful switching between task focus and imagining.","Gotlieb, Rebecca and Hyde, Elizabeth and Immordino-Yang, Mary Helen and Kaufman, Scott Barry",0,10.1111/nyas.13165,1591

2245,Beyond the Credibility of Electronic Word of Mouth: Exploring eWOM Adoption on Social Networking Sites from Affective and Curiosity Perspectives,"Social networking sites (SNSs) are one of the Web 2.0's most utilized services, and the influential force of electronic word of mouth (eWOM) on SNSs deserves our unequivocal attention. This study aims to explore how users of SNSs adopt information embedded in eWOM reviews shared by other users. Using the stimulus-organism-response model and affect-as-information theory, we devised and tested a theoretical framework linking both a cognitive path and an affective path to approach eWOM adoption on SNSs. Two curiosity constructs-informational deprivation epistemic curiosity (D-EC) and interest-type epistemic curiosity (I-EC)-are regarded as moderators of the cognitive path and the affective path, respectively. Data collected from 445 respondents support all of our hypotheses. The results show that beyond the conventional cognitive path (cognitive stimuli and the credibility of eWOM), the affective path (affective stimuli and arousal) can also contribute to eWOM adoption. We also find that SNS users focus on different stimuli of SNSs, depending on their levels of D-EC and I-EC. Our findings provide new perspectives to SNS designers and users on how to manage eWOM reviews on SNSs.","Fang, Yu-Hui",0,10.2753/JEC1086-4415180303,1593
2246,"Residential mobility and flourishing among united states school-age children, 2011/2012 national survey of children's health","Objectives To investigate the association of residential mobility with flourishing among school-age children. Methods Data from the 2011/2012 National Survey of Children's Health were used to examine parent/caregiver-reported information on flourishing and residential mobility for children age 6-17 (N = 63,333). Residential mobility was the number of times the child moved categorized as: none, 1-2, and 3+. Children who were reported to show interest/curiosity, finish tasks, stay calm/in control, care about doing well in school, and do all homework were coded as flourishing. Sex-specific multivariable models were used to model the relative risk of mobility on flourishing. Interactions of mobility with age and poverty were tested. Results Among US school-age children, 22% had no moves, 39% had 1-2 moves and 39% had 3+ moves in their lifetime. Nearly half (45%) were flourishing. Both boys and girls who moved 3+ times were less likely to flourish compared to children with no moves. Among poor boys moving 3+ times was associated with less flourishing (aRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71, 0.98) with no association for non-poor boy. Among girls the pattern was reversed (aRR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81, 0.95 for non-poor girls and no association for poor girls). Conclusions for Practice Residential mobility may lead to lower rates of flourishing. The patterns, when stratified by age or poverty, are different for boys and girls.

2247,"History, overview, and trends in child and adolescent psychological assessment","We contend that child assessment has taken place as long as parents and other adults have observed and tracked changes in children's development. Parents notice changes over time within a given child and differences among children in abilities and responses to circumstances. This type of informal evaluation process certainly is a far cry from the empirically based, standardized methods of child and adolescent psychological assessment that have developed over the past 150 years or so, but it is foundational. The current state-of-the-art of assessing childhood psychopathology and developmental disabilities is presented in this volume of a two-volume edited series. Each topic and issue covered includes a common core: adults have an interest in understanding, documenting, and predicting the capacities and experiences of children. In addition, these contributions to the literature have an applied slant: that is, interventions designed to influence outcomes emanate from competent assessment. Our psychological assessment approaches have become more sophisticated, but are linked historically to our predecessors' curiosity about how children grow and learn and what ""to do"" with this knowledge. In this chapter, we use the words, ""child"" or ""children"" to refer to individuals whose chronological age ranges from birth to late adolescence. Otherwise, we note if a particular description applies specifically to an infant/toddler, preschool-aged young child, a school-aged child, or a teenager. First, we present an overview of some of the key historical events that have shaped child assessment today. Next, we offer an overview of issues central to child assessment methods early in the 21st century. Finally, we suggest overarching trends that we believe are influencing directions for the field of child psychological assessment.

2249,Sexual cases in child guidance clinics,"Among the numerous cases of children and youths brought to guidance clinics, a large place is occupied by those apparently manifesting sexual difficulties. Nowhere do we find so much confusion and misunderstanding as in this domain. The author shows by means of a few examples that these cases present only a part of the general difficulties besetting children and youths, and that accordingly they can be removed only by changing the general attitude of each particular personality. The complaints generally refer to onanism, to strongly accentuated and intensely active sexual curiosity; in isolated cases, also to sexual delinquency. In all cases it is possible to show that these disturbances never occurred in isolation, but always in connection with other bad habits. Adults, however, pay much more attention to symptoms of this nature than to other difficulties, presumably because the memory of their own unfortunate sexual experiences prevents them from approaching sexual education with the necessary candor and impartiality. Their partiality is the source of two serious educational errors. In the first place, all questions of sex are carefully avoided by them and surrounded with mystery, since they still represent for them a dark sovereign power. This more than anything else is apt to stimulate the curiosity of the child. In the second place, they put off the child with untrue answers whenever he asks anything of his own accord. A double harm is thus done to the child. He is made to suspect that there must be something unbeautiful and obscene about everything connected with sex. For he does not fail to notice that adults have a weighty interest in hushing up these matters, and he knows from his own experience that people try to hide only those things of which they are ashamed. The child is in this way given the worst possible guidance and preparation for a task in life which can be solved not by itself alone but only as a part of the whole human personality.

It elicits students' views about the exhibits, zones, and activities, along with their level of interest and experiences. Data from students (n = 346) through a survey, field notes, observations and interviews (n = 18) were collected. The findings indicated that curiosity and interest were triggers for visiting the exhibits at the center. Visiting the exhibits helped students acquire science content knowledge. However, limited social interaction was observed among the student groups due to the control of tour guides within a limited period of time. It was concluded that time restriction and crowding played a crucial role in learning about science at the center. It was recommended to allocate more time for free visits, organize smaller group visits, and repair setups under maintenance in order to enhance the effect of the exhibits on students.","Ayar, Mehmet C",0,,1598
2251,How law clerks influence: Information at the U.S. Supreme Court,"The role of law clerks at the United States Supreme Court has long been a source of curiosity among observers and scholars alike. Of particular interest are what characteristics determine which applicants are selected to clerk and what influence clerks have on the justices' decision making. Using a two-part framework that identifies information asymmetries, where clerks possess relevant information that they can transmit to their justices, and conditions under which this information leads a justice to learn about policies' impact, I uncover evidence of a causal mechanism by which clerks wield systematic influence over the justices' decision making. I show that information clerks convey that is derived from their ideological preferences and from their experiences and socialization influences their justices' votes on the merits. In the concluding chapter, I argue that these findings shed light on the broader class of principal-agent relationships of which the justice-clerk dynamic is an example and discuss how law clerks pose an opportunity for scholars to learn how principals acquire and use information from their advisors.","Kromphardt, Christopher David",0,,1599

Ten members of our research group served as both researchers and participants. Three of us transcribed and analyzed our four-hour discussion using qualitative methodological techniques to uncover patterns and themes. Our overriding theme ""Identity of feminist women in graduate school"" encompassed four major themes: Creation of feminist identity; Negotiation of new gender roles; Valuing and devaluing all things feminine; and Interface with the masculine world.

2253,Disappearance beyond Recall: A Social Context for Bronze Age Aurochs Extinction in Britain?,"The interest which attaches to the history of extinct British animals can only be equalled by the regret which must be felt, by all true naturalists, at their disappearance beyond recall from our fauna (Harting 1880, 3; emphasis added). The implications of pit-deposits containing aurochs/Bos primigenius skulls dating to the Bronze Age, found in two recent excavations in Bedfordshire are outlined. Involving a review of related findings in south-eastern England, these serve as a platform to consider the dynamics of aurochs extinction, which is held to have occurred in Britain by the middle-later centuries of the 2nd millennium bc. It should be stressed that, although consulting many 'expert' colleagues, this paper is not written from a faunal remains-specialist perspective. It is essentially discursive and primarily intended to highlight a significant site-recovery trend. It reflects, moreover, on issues of broad social relevance.

2256,Cultural geography and the inner dimensions of the quest for knowledge,"In North American cultural geography, intellectual curiosity has motivated most scholarship directed to learning about the world. Two aspects of that curiosity, epistemic inquisitiveness and wonder, work together to drive the pursuit of knowledge that has the potential to reach an ecstatic consciousness. A great exemplar of intellectual curiosity as a powerful motivational force was Carl O. Sauer (1889-1975), who considered pure inquiry based on intrinsic interest as the foundation of geographical scholarship. That research can also have a euphoric dimension is described in three vignettes of past projects in Highland Peru, the Mascarene Archipelago, and equatorial Brazil, which make explicit how wanting to know and wondering about what might be known prompt ideas and drive them forward. With introspection, cultural geographers are in a position to inform the discipline about how scholarship that conjoins thought and feeling can lead to an understanding of motivation and an appreciation of the intellectual virtues and peak experiences that accrue from scholarly endeavor. To do that requires a willingness to get beyond the reticence that has kept the affective dimension out of research reports. <c2><a9> 2012 Copyright JCG Press, Oklahoma State University.","Gade, D W",0,10.1080/08873631.2012.726449,1602

Problems with institutional care of children and fads in such care are noted. Criteria for use in evaluating proposals for early child care programs are suggested: adequate nutrition, handling of illness, stimulation, talking to baby, sensorimotor exercise, encouragement of skill mastery, and continuity in warm relationships. Interrelationships among these factors are discussed. Mentioned are several factors which may be instrumental in explaining the lack of curiosity and of development of creativity in underprivileged children and of the preschool activities which may aid in this development. Presented are 5 longitudinal research programs designed to provide cognitive and other stimulation to young children, some of the experiments training parents to be stimulators, and all of the research concerned with optimal environments for adequate development.

Research in secondary education, however, has focused on cognitive and conative factors rather than personality. In the present large-scale study, we investigated the relation between TIE and achievement tests in math and science in Grade 9. A three-dimensional model (reading, contemplation, intellectual curiosity) provided high theoretical plausibility and satisfactory model fit. We quantified the predictive power of TIE with hierarchical regression models. After controlling for gender, migration background, and socioeconomic status, TIE contributed substantially to the explanation of math and science achievement. However, this effect almost disappeared after fluid intelligence and interest were added into the model. Thus, we found only limited support for the significance of TIE on educational achievement at least for subjects more strongly relying on fluid abilities such as math and science.

2263,The rational induction of belief,"Let us recall for a moment the two children from our first chapter, the children to whom the slot-machine was shown. One of the latter wanted a second penny put into the slot because he was eager to have another piece of chocolate. I suggested that this child's interest in the machine was essentially in its centripetal ego-relation. The other child wanted a second penny put into the slot because he desired to know how the machine produced the chocolate. The interest of this child, I intimated, was not dominatingly in the ego-relation of the machine, but rather in the relation of part to part of the latter, and of the total machine to the falling out of the piece of chocolate. His interest, in other words, was centrifugally directed, being an interest in the relation of things to things rather than in the relation of things to himself. Any active interest reflects the working of some impulse or some impulses, this being one of the basic assumptions of hormic psychology. The interest urging the desire of the first child, who wanted another piece of chocolate, is evident; it is a near derivative of the food-seeking instinct. But what is the impulse urging the desire of the second child, the desire to know how the machine produced the piece of chocolate? In my monograph on Schizophrenia, I suggested that this impulse is the one of curiosity, and I argued the proposition that the rational or objective viewing of things in their universal relations is always ultimately the expression of the curiosity impulse. It is my intent to try to elaborate this proposition further in the present work.

2265,Validity of the Interest- and Deprivation-Type Epistemic Curiosity Model in Germany,"Three studies were conducted to evaluate the validity of the interest (I) and deprivation (D) type epistemic curiosity (EC) distinction in three German samples. In Study 1 (N = 395) and Study 2 (N = 191), responses to German translations of the Epistemic Curiosity Scale and the Curiosity as a Feeling-of-Deprivation Scale were submitted to confirmatory factor analysis. The previously found 10-item 2-factor model (Litman, 2008; Litman, Crowson, & Kolinski, 2010) had the best fit compared to competing models. In Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 (N = 249), the I- and D-type EC scales correlated positively with intellectual stimulation measures, providing evidence of convergent validity. I-type EC correlated with enjoying new discoveries and ideas, whereas D-type EC was associated with persistence and solving problems, providing evidence of discrimination.","Litman, Jordan A and Mussel, Patrick",0,10.1027/1614-0001/a000100,1608
2267,"An investigation of the relationships among mathematical beliefs, self-regulation, and achievement for university-level mathematics students","This study investigated the relationships among mathematical beliefs, sources of self-regulation, and achievement for university-level remedial mathematics students. Most self-regulation models put emphasis on active self-regulation, including the use of cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies, as the only internal source of self-regulation that impacts learning processes. However, the biofunctional model proposes that learning is multisource in nature, affected by both external and internal sources. This model includes, as a second internal source of self-regulation, dynamic (or biofunctional) self-regulation processes as the immediate source of curiosity and interest. Furthermore, epistemological and mathematical beliefs have been shown to be related to self-regulation and achievement. Therefore, both beliefs and self-regulation may be seen as contributors to student learning. This is especially important for remedial students, whose possibly nonavailing beliefs about mathematics and/or poor self-regulation may adversely affect their learning for understanding. In this study, 94 mathematics students completed two surveys to measure mathematical beliefs and active self-regulation, dynamic self-regulation, and multiple-source self-regulation. The results showed that students who reported more availing beliefs about the nature of mathematics, the doing, validating, and learning of mathematics, and the usefulness of mathematics were more likely to report greater frequency of all three types of self-regulation. The belief about the usefulness of mathematics and multiple-source self-regulation positively predicted mathematics achievement, whereas active self-regulation negatively predicted mathematics achievement. Multiple-source self-regulation was a positive predictor of academic achievement as well. Most of the findings were consistent with biofunctional theory. The implication of this study is that mathematics educators need to recognize the importance of availing mathematical beliefs as well as multiple-source or wholetheme self-regulation for possibly better learning outcomes for students.

2269,Jane Ellen Harrison's â€œHandmaiden No Moreâ€: Victorian ritualism and the fine arts,"Victorians were fascinated by ancient ritual; they studied it, depicted it, and frequently reenacted it. Artists painted enormous works celebrating both Christian and pagan rites. Musicians and dancers revived the antique Morris dances. Theosophical practitioners engaged in reenactments of Egyptian and other Near Eastern ceremonies. Like so many other curiosities gathered from a vastly expanding empire, the rituals of ancient and primitive peoples, oddly enough, intrigued some of the most sophisticated members of an increasingly secularized society. Although the late nineteenth century is frequently characterized as a period during which many members of British society experienced a ""crisis of faith,"" it was actually a period of vital and intense awareness about spirituality and matters of religion including sacred behaviors. Some scholars, while personally disaffected from traditional religions, nonetheless acknowledged the rich phenomenology of the religious experiences of the past and sought ways to incorporate it into meaningful contemporary discourse. This dissertation examines the impact of this heightened interest in ancient ritual on fine arts theories and productions of the time that, in turn, influenced the work of classical scholar Jane Ellen Harrison. Harrison's theories about art and ritual are prime examples of the cultural shift in perceptions about ritual experience and expressions of spirituality that occurred during the latter half of the nineteenth century. Drawing on her first-hand examination of ancient material culture, Harrison posited theories about Greek religion that precipitated revised notions about sacred images and ritual reenactments. In her 1913 book Ancient Art and Ritual, she challenged the weighty iconoclasm of the post-Reformation Protestantism she scorned. She deftly proposed a reintegration of ritual art of a less conventional sort into what she perceived to be the depleted fabric of social and cultural life among her contemporaries. Her work deftly relocated the ritual experience within a fine arts context where its relevance for an increasingly secularized community was reframed as a new type of spirituality. Harrison's investigations into the origins of art and ritual revealed a former time and, through her, encouraged a future practice wherein art was no longer a mere handmaiden to religion; instead, art was a religion.","Wright, Rita R",0,,1610
2270,Stressful experiences of urbanized small town police officers: A case study,"Few occupations garner as much interest and curiosity as that of the police officer. The popularity and apparently endless fascination with law enforcement gives rise to numerous depictions of the police in movies, in print media, and on television. Popular television shows, such as Brooklyn South, Brooklyn Nine-nine, C.S. I. Miami, C.S.I. NY, NYC 22, NYPD Blue, and LAPD: Life on the Beat often give the impression that police officers only work in big-city police departments and the workplace stress they experience is due to working in such environments. Since most police-stress research involves officers who work in urban police departments, and the majority of officers in the United States do not work in such big-city environments, much of the extant literature on police-workplace stress may be inaccurate. This study identifies a gap in the literature by examining the stress experiences of small town police officers and may add to the existing body of knowledge on police stress. The findings brought about by this research include that urbanized small town police stress comes from the organizational aspects of the work environment. A certain extent of the stress experienced by an officer comes from experiencing a career in law enforcement that differs greatly from what they had expected. Patrol officers and patrol supervisors both describe workplace stress experiences that emanate mainly from the power wielded by the local town board to alter the police department. Finally, there appears to be no psychological support program in place available exclusively for urbanized small town police officers and the specific types of issues they may encounter.

2271,From maintaining the status quo to promoting free thinking and inquiry: Business students' perspective on the purpose of business school teaching,"We are facing a world where business schools have made it their primary aim to enhance student career prospects and/or salaries by teaching business solely from a business perspective. The authors of this article explore international business students' viewpoints on the purpose of business school teaching and business school graduates. Having operationalized a typology of business school graduates as a student survey, the authors show that students expect a balanced education. As a business school graduate, they see their purpose not only to replace the existing successful managers and increase the effectiveness of organizations but also to be able to ensure humane, ethical and eco-friendly organizations promoting economic and social welfare and justice. In addition, and quite contrary to what many claim in extant literature, students value and identify with intellectual curiosity, critical thinking and introspection which would ultimately pave the way for serving the public interest. We therefore suggest that for a business school to 'legitimately' position itself as a university and rightfully provide academic degrees, it should, in addition to providing students with a profit-maximization toolkit, deliver a wider education balancing different (human, moral, environmental, social and so on) perspectives.

2273,The incremental validity of intellectual curiosity and confidence for predicting academic performance in advanced tertiary students,"Intellectual curiosity is a topic of research interest and often predicts academic performance (AP). However, evidence for its incremental validity, which the present study aimed to assess, is mixed. Participants were 216 (52 males, 151 females, 13 not reported) third-year psychology students (age M = 23.0 yrs) who completed tests of fluid and crystallised intelligence, five-factor model (FFM) personality, intellectual curiosity, and confidence. AP was obtained from university transcripts. No incremental validity above intelligence and FFM personality was found for measures of curiosity or confidence. In all analyses, Conscientiousness was the most substantial predictor of AP. Future research may focus on the conditions in which curiosity or confidence predict AP. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

2274,Classroom Pets and Young Children: Supporting Early Development,"Many young children have a natural attraction to and curiosity about animals. They like to observe, touch, talk to, and ask questions about them. Teachers and parents both can use this broad interest to facilitate children's development and learning in a variety of domains. Research shows that children across ages find emotional comfort in their relationships with animals. They feel at ease talking to their pets about their fears, joys, frustrations, and everyday events and activities. In this article the authors employ the teaching pyramid as a framework for using pets to promote children's social-emotional development in early childhood settings. The ""teaching pyramid"" is a model for supporting social competence and preventing challenging behavior in young children. It is based on principles of positive behavior support (PBS), research on effective teaching of young children, and effective strategies for promoting children's social competence. The model includes four levels of practice to address the needs of all children: (1) building positive relationships with children, families, and colleagues; (2) implementing classroom preventive practices and creating supportive environments; (3) using social and emotional teaching strategies; and (4) planning intensive individualized interventions. The central idea in the model is that addressing the first three levels meets the needs of most children in the group. Only a small number of children in a given classroom may require the more intensive support of individualized interventions (level 4). The teaching ideas are based on both the research suggesting that pets can help support the social-emotional development of children with and without disabilities and the authors' experience as teachers who have had pets in their classrooms. Level 4 of the teaching pyramid requires intensive individualized intervention, hence it is not included in this article.","Meadan, Hedda and Jegatheesan, Brinda",0,,1615
2276,"OnmyÅji: Sex, pathos, and grotesquery in Yumemakura Baku's Oni","The common representation of oni (goblins, demons) in Japanese folklore is of evil, monstrous supernatural creatures malevolent to living beings. However, in recent popular depictions of onmy<c5><8d>ji, and by extension Abe no Seimei (921?-1005?), in fiction, manga, and film oni are presented as lonely and misunderstood, if still monstrous, creatures. Author Yumemakura Baku (1951-) situates his representations of oni in the Heian period (794-1192). His characterizations of people and oni are, however, informed by a much more modern pathos, evidently very appealing to contemporary Japanese readers and viewers. At a deeper level, the current popularity of onmy<c5><8d>ji creatures and characters may well reveal latent Japanese interests in religion and the supernatural that reflect in turn people's existential anxieties about contemporary life and also their curiosity and interest in some form of afterlife.","Reider, N T",0,,1616
2277,A view from aesthetic education,"My esteemed late colleague Harry S. Broudy often expressed curiosity about invitations he received to address subjects and topics about which he had little specialized knowledge. But the reason was quite apparent; as a philosopher he had the skill to detect issues that helped others to think more wisely about their ramifications. I occasionally find myself in a similar position. Although I have only general knowledge about music and do not follow developments in the field of music education as closely as in my own area of special interest, I often receive invitations from music educators to join in their deliberations. It is not, I think, because of any special knack for detecting and clarifying issues but rather because of my philosophy of aesthetic education that might be of some interest to music educators. The following then are a few notes about my thinking insofar as it centres on the arts and not broader conceptions of aesthetic education.","Smith, R A",0,10.1177/1321103X010170010701,1617
2278,Parental reflective functioning and children's emergent reading skills: ERP and longitudinal behavioral measures,"The current study examined the correlations between parental reflective functioning and children's phonological awareness and reading-related neural development (measured via a phoneme-processing experiment using EEG), and its utility as a predictor of children's reading skills one year later when they have begun literacy education. Fourteen pre-readers' (mean age 4.51 years) phonological awareness and their parents' reflective functioning skills were assessed, along with their EEG responses in a phoneme- processing task. Children's phonological awareness and emergent reading skills were assessed again 12--15 months later, at the start of First Grade. Left-lateralized neural indices were observed to be correlated with parental reflective functioning (PRF) and children's later reading-related skills. Specifically, scores on measures of PRF: Interest & Curiosity were positively correlated with the N2 amplitude in the left temporal cortex (p = 0.049), and the P2 amplitude in the left temporal cortex was also correlated with children's Phonological Awareness scores (p = 0.004) and with their Basic Reading scores (p = 0.002) one year later. Multiple linear regression analyses also revealed that scores on measures of PRF: Interest and Curiosity significantly predicted children's future phonological awareness (p = 0.014) and basic reading skills (p = 0.002). This study is the first of its kind to identify correlations between parental engagement and neural indices of children's pre-reading skills, and to reveal parental reflective functioning as a strong predictor of children's later reading abilities.

2279,Converging science and literature cultures: Learning physics via the Little Prince novella,"Primary level education follows a pedagogy model where literature and science have been historically separated. Natural children processes are disrupted, as learning based on play curiosity is completely transformed by a chalkboard model. Specific experimental realizations can link thinking processes based on science to study problems contextualized by literature. Converging the essences of these two cultures has the potential to enhance the education experience, dramatically. This paper proposes a new didactic strategy using experimental demonstrations based on The Little Prince story, providing a journey through different philosophical questions about nature and Universe laws. Therefore, the story is used as a scientific metaphor applied to a teaching-learning situation. A workshop was implemented to a group of 26 students attending sixth grade (mean age = 12 years old), from two primary schools located in Heredia, Costa Rica. In order to evaluate the sessions' performance, Pearson's test for independence was used to contrast association within a set of variables related to perception of learning processes and emerging interest in science. Overall 77% of the students perceived an increased interest in science, despite gender characteristics. Curiously, a gender association was observed related to the preferences girls and boys have for specific experimental demonstrations. Additionally, 92% of the students perceived learning of scientific concepts after the sessions delivered. Our research establishes a new didactic strategy with the potential to break historical pedagogical patterns and could pave the way into integration of contrasting disciplines. <c2><a9> 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Godinez-Sandi, A and Fallas-Padilla, D and Espana-Tapia, S and Zuniga-Villegas, A and Castro, M and Herrera-Sancho, O A",0,10.1088/1361-6552/aad721,1619

2282,Personal reflections on Morton Deutsch's influence on the study of mediation,"This article presents an account of Morton Deutsch's influence on the study of 3rd-party conflict mediation. Written in the spirit of a personal memoir, it emphasizes how Deutsch's theoretical interests, as well as his personal approach to research and research collaboration, have influenced the empirical study of mediation. On the personal side, the key elements have been his enthusiasm for ""real world"" problems, his disinclination to see theory and practice as 2 separate realms, his methodological pluralism, and his egalitarian approach to research collaboration. His conceptual influence on mediation research is traceable to his focus on identifying the conditions that give rise to constructive, rather than destructive, processes of conflict resolution; his curiosity about what mediators do to constructively manage conflict; and his interest in the intersection between the individual - in this case the mediating individual - and the social structure.

2285,The evolution of humor from male aggression,"The response to seeing a man riding a unicycle was reported to be consistently related to the viewer's sex and stage of physical development. To see if this observation was universal, observations of responses were collected from 23 male and 9 female unicyclists aged 15-69 years, with 2-40 years cycling experience across four continents. With two exceptions among men, the findings were the same as those originally reported: children showed interest and curiosity, young girls showed little interest, while adult women showed a kindly, concerned, praising response. By contrast, boys showed physical aggression, which became more verbal, merging in the later teens to the snide, aggressive, stereotyped humorous response shown by adult males, which became less frequent in elderly men. The universality of the response across different individuals, environments, and dates of observation suggests an endogenous mechanism, and the association with masculine development relates this to androgen. The theoretical consequences are discussed. It is concluded that humor develops from aggression in males and is evolutionarily related to sexual selection. <c2><a9> 2012 Shuster, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.","Shuster, S",0,10.2147/PRBM.S29126,1622

2293,Burning hearts in conflict: New perspectives on the intragroup conflict and team effectiveness relationship,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships between three conflict types, cognitive task conflict, emotional relationship conflict and emotional task conflict, and team effectiveness (team performance and team job satisfaction). Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a group-level ordinary least square regression analysis of 61 working teams to investigate the study variables, and possible interaction effects among them. In an auxiliary analysis (36 teams), they analyzed the role of mood dimensions (hedonic valence and general conflict activation) as mediators to the relationship between cognitive task conflict and team effectiveness. Findings: Cognitive task conflict was negatively related to team performance, emotional relationship conflict was negatively related to team job satisfaction and emotional task conflict was positively related to team performance, all controlled for the effect of each other. The relationship between cognitive task conflict and team job satisfaction was negatively moderated by team size. Mood valence mediated the relationship between cognitive task conflict and team performance, and between cognitive task conflict and team job satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: Several possible research lines emanate from the current field study. First of all, the authors suggest that emotional task conflict may be of particular interest, as this is hypothesized and found to be incrementally positively related to team performance. Second, their auxiliary study of the mediating effect of mood valence on the relationship between cognitive task conflict and performance may spur curiosity concerning the role of mood as a mediator of the relationship between task or cognitive conflicts and team effectiveness. Practical implications: The practitioner should be advised to try to facilitate the distribution of intragroup conflict in their teams in the direction of an increased level of emotional task conflict (positive for performance) at the expense of cognitive task conflict (negative for performance) and emotional relationship conflict (negative for satisfaction). The practitioner should allow intragroup conflicts to be highly activated (intense), as long as the interactions are strictly directed to the task in hand, and not being personal. Originality/value: The three conflict types in this three-dimensional intragroup conflict model (3IC) have never been tested before, and the findings open for a conflict type <e2><80><93> emotional task conflict <e2><80><93> that may generally be conducive for the teams<e2><80><99> performance, evaluated by the teams<e2><80><99> supervisors.

Recently, the rapid deployment of large-scale wireless infrastructures in various environments and the interesting mixture of traffic carried coupled with the large diversity of devices accessing the medium (Cellphones, Laptops, PDAs) have triggered the attention and curiosity of the research community. This paper analyzes in depth the properties of several large traces of packet data collected between the wireless access point and the IP cloud from an operational wireless service provider. We determine unambiguously the influence of network variables such as the arrival patterns of packet and flows, flow durations and flow interactions, on the aggregate statistics of TCP traffic. In doing so, we highlight the main differences and similarities between wireless and wired IP traffic, and between the two directions (from wireless devices to IP cloud and vice-versa), and show how they can he distinguished. The resulting insights provide a foundation for models of such traffic, necessary for improved resource allocation schemes as well as for the effectiveness of future services and applications.","Ridoux, Julien and Nucci, Antonio and Veitch, Darryl",0,,1628
2295,Colonial experience and the development of tropical geography in France,"This article broadly positions the successful establishment of the field of French tropical geography in the immediate postwar period against developments stemming from a longer history of French colonial engagement in Africa, Asia and South America, and clarifies the seemingly late timing of, and paradoxes involved in, the creation of a body of French scientific knowledge about the tropics. Colonial scientific research did not develop in France until the end of the nineteenth century. However, the colonial geography appearing at this time did not rely on fieldwork but, rather, catered to the demands of the business class for overseas expansion and to public curiosity. Even while the medical geography of tropical areas and knowledge of tropical soils and ecology progressed greatly between 1900 and 1940, there were still only a few French geographers working in the tropics. With the advent of the Second World War, when ""big science"" appeared in France and its colonial empire, the number of French geographers involved in tropical research grew rapidly. The field of tropical geography built up by Pierre Gourou was a synthesis of approaches developed in South America, Africa and Indochina. Although it soon came under strong criticism for its pessimistic view of prospects for industrialisation and urbanisation in the tropics, it seduced French geographers because it matched the contemporary interest in zonality and relied on a genre de vie analysis of, typically, rural areas. Thus, the postwar blossoming of tropical geography shaped by Gourou was more a response to various internal dynamics within French geography than an exercise in imperialism. Its demise was not due to the eclipse of French colonialism but, rather, its inability to deal with the modernisation of tropical societies. <c2><a9> Copyright 2005 Department of Geography, National University of Singapore and Blackwell Publishers Ltd.","Claval, P",0,10.1111/j.1467-9493.2005.00225.x,1629

2297,The emotional experience of adoption: A psychoanalytic perspective,"Adoption is a theme of both universal interest and profound and unusual particularity. In this book, Hans Christian Andersen's tale of Thumbelina and the story of Heathcliff in Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, which appear in the first and final chapters, attest to the former. In between, we are offered a series of rich, moving, and often very painful stories arising from therapeutic engagements with adopted children and their families by some of the most experienced and thoughtful practitioners working in this field. Recent developments in UK government policy with respect to adoption and children in public care embody the difficulty, or perhaps the impossibility, of ever properly bridging the gap between these polarities of the universal and the particular when it comes to adoption. Policies advocating the removal of barriers to opportunity for children in care or placed for adoption are laudable in their intentions, but tend to be silent on the complex and unique emotional realities facing these children and young people, and their carers. This book is an important contribution to redressing this balance. The emotional realities of abuse, neglect and abandonment experienced by so many of the children who are placed for adoption are almost unthinkably painful. Yet the task of trying to live lives as 'ordinary' as possible in the face of such experiences, and of helping adoptive families integrate this 'unthinkability' is the crucial contribution that therapists and social workers can make in this field.

Nowadays, one of the popular cryptography protocols is hybrid cryptosystem that uses symmetric and public key cryptography to change secret message. In available cryptography protocol attackers are always aware of transmission of sensitive data. Even non-interested attackers can get interested to break the ciphertext out of curiosity and challenge, when suddenly catches some scrambled data over the network. In this paper we discuss about the disadvantages of asymmetric algorithms in cryptography protocol. Furthermore, this paper proposes new cryptography protocol based on DNA steganography to reduce the usage of public cryptography to exchange session key. In this protocol session key between sender and receiver is hidden by DNA data hiding technique. Therefore, the attackers are not aware of transmission of session key through unsecure channel. Finally, the strength point of the DNA steganography is discussed.","Torkaman, Mohammad Reza Najaf and Nikfard, Pourya and Kazazi, Nazanin and Sadat and Abbasy, Mohammad Reza and Tabatabaiee, S Farzaneh",0,,1632
2299,Foundation of problem-based learning: Some explanatory notes,"Elaborates on the cognitive effects of problem based learning (PBL) put forward by H. G. Schmidt et al (see record 1990-15749-001) and G. T. Norman and H. G. Schmidt (see record 1993-15395-001). The authors discuss in detail the theoretical premises of this approach to learning and instruction. It is argued that PBL promotes activation of prior knowledge and its elaboration. Evidence is reviewed demonstrating that these processes actually occur in small-group tutorials and that the processing of new information is indeed facilitated by discussion of a relevant problem. These effects must be attributed to a reorganization taking place in the knowledge structures of students as a result of problem oriented study. In addition, a cognitive process called epistemic curiosity (or intrinsic interest) is enabled.

2300,"Writing in the early years: Understanding the past, confronting the present, imagining the future","This chapter considers three pivotal studies: ""Developmental Sequences in Name Writing""; Children Who Read Early; and Children's Categorization of Speech Sounds in English. It starts with information about the context of each pivotal work and its key findings, and then traces each researcher's influence on subsequent research and writing practices at the preschool level. The chapter draws upon several key ideas from the pivotal studies to compare early writing practices in preschool classrooms during the period from the late 1980s to the late 1990s with practices found in many preschools today. It focuses on the role that interest plays in preschoolers' writing and on the conditions in preschools today that affect whether children can pursue their interests in a writing center and also in dramatic play, block, and art centers. The chapter reviews the role of children's interests and curiosity in the three pivotal studies and the importance of responsiveness to the questions that stem from children's curiosity and interest. It finally explains the rationale for decisions that classroom teachers and the author made about interacting with children at the writing center during center time, and then describes the range of child behavior.

2301,Health in school program: From training processes to practice scenarios,"Introduction: The Health in School Program (PSE) is an intersectoral policy between the ministries of health and education with the perspective of integral attention (prevention, promotion and attention) to the health of children, adolescents and young people in basic public education, within the framework of schools and basic health units. It has five structural components to be developed by professionals, who need ongoing training to reach their goals and goals. Objective: To analyse the training process of PSE health and education professionals. Methods: Qualitative research, based on the theoretical framework of Paulo Freire, whose epistemological categories were compiled by Ecco (reading of the world, significant themes, dialogue, curiosity and problematization). Collection of data was conducted through an interview with 45 professionals and analysed. Results: The reading of the world in relation to the training was permeated with doubts regarding the work with the adolescents. Regarding the significant themes, they expressed an interest in studying some content for the particularities of this publication. The dialogue was encouraged in the transfer of the information and determinations established by management. As for the curiosity, the professionals pointed out uncertainties about the continuity of the actions of the programme and reported learning needs that were not contemplated. The problematization was not evident in the speeches. Conclusion: There are gaps in the professional formation in the PSE for an action that considers the promotion of health in adolescents. <c2><a9> The authors (2018).","Marinho, M.N.A.S.B. and Vieira, N F C and Ferreira, H S and Pequeno, A M C and Sousa, I C and Pereira, A P and de Ara<c3><ba>jo, A F and Machado, M.F.A.S.",0,10.7322/jhgd.147219,1635

A common challenge is to identify which aspects of online interaction influence user engagement the most. In this article, through an analysis of a news article collection obtained from Yahoo News US, we demonstrate that news articles exhibit considerable variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content, depending on factors such as news provider and genre. Moreover, through a laboratory study, we observe the effect of sentimentality and polarity of news and comments on a set of subjective and objective measures of engagement. In particular, we show that attention, affect, and gaze differ across news of varying interestingness. As part of our study, we also explore methods that exploit the sentiments expressed in user comments to reorder the lists of comments displayed in news pages. Our results indicate that user engagement can be anticipated predicted if we account for the sentimentality and polarity of the content as well as other factors that drive attention and inspire human curiosity.","Arapakis, Ioannis and Lalmas, Mounia and Barla Cambazoglu, B and Marcos, Mari-Carmen and Jose, Joemon M",0,10.1002/asi.23096,1637
2305,Managing the power of curiosity for effective web advertising strategies,"This research investigates the effect of curiosity on the effectiveness of Internet advertising. In particular, we identify processes that underlie curiosity resolution and study its impact on consumer motivation and learning. The dataset from our simulated Internet experiment includes process tracking variables (i.e., clickstream data from ad-embedded links), traditional attitude and behavioral intention measures, and open-ended protocols. We find that a curiosity-generating advertising strategy increases interest and learning relative to a strategy that provides detailed product information. Furthermore, though curiosity does not dramatically increase the observed quantity of search in our study, it seems to improve the quality of search substantially (i.e., time spent and attention devoted to specific information), resulting in better and more focused memory and comprehension of new product information. To enhance the effectiveness of Internet advertising of new products, we recommend a curiosity advertising strategy based on four elements: (1) curiosity generation by highlighting a gap in extant knowledge, (2) the presence of a hint to guide elaboration for curiosity resolution, (3) sufficient time to try and resolve curiosity as well as the assurance of curiosity-resolving information, and (4) the use of measures of consumer elaboration and learning to gauge advertising effectiveness.","Menon, S and Soman, D",0,,1638

2312,Changing ownership structures in the Dutch fleet,"The new Dutch shipping policy has given rise to high expectation and curiosity in the world of shipping. This, together with the obvious difficulties of an ex-post study of the effectiveness of such innovative policy, has prompted the authors to take an interest in attempting to investigate changes in ownership of the Dutch fleet 2 years after the new policy has been introduced. To do this, a rather new concept of 'flagging out' has been adopted, which is interpreted as a process leading to different degrees of 'foreignness' in a shipping operation. In this paper, a method to structure is presented, and ownership information, and changes in it are presented, that are essentially based on the theory of stochastic processes. The data used is the Dutch fleet data, which includes information on the nationality of the flag, parent ownership and management over the period 1994-1998. The results yield interesting insights in the shifts in the ownership and operational structure of shipping companies induced by the new policy. In particular, they allow one to establish the origin of new vessels, in which stage of ownership/operation it is most likely that shifts occur, and to determine the relationship between the different stages of the 'flagging out' process. These results, thus, enable an evaluation of the areas in which the policy can be expected to yield results.","Veenstra, A W and Bergantino, A S",0,10.1080/030888300286590,1641
2315,An Exploratory Study of Black Female Clinicians' Experiences in Therapy with Black Male Adolescents,"Black male adolescents in America have experienced many challenges in recent years specific to their race and gender, particularly with regard to education, e.g., disproportionality in rates of school punishment and the achievement gap, as well as mass incarceration, racial profiling, and police shootings. Despite the serious nature of these realities, it is important to note that the literature has devoted little attention to issues facing clinicians, particularly Black female clinicians, working with this population. To add to the limited literature on same-race therapeutic dyads, this qualitative study explored Black female clinicians<e2><80><99> experiences treating Black male adolescents. Ten clinicians who had worked with Black male adolescents were interviewed. A qualitative research design analysis of their interviews was conducted using a Grounded Theory methodology (Corbin & Strauss, 2014). Key themes related to the treatment of Black male adolescents by Black female clinicians emerged, including (a) the importance of the therapeutic alliance and building rapport, such as showing curiosity about the adolescent<e2><80><99>s interests and exhibiting a genuine, non-punitive therapeutic style; (b) emotional reactions of Black male adolescents toward Black female clinicians, including positive and negative emotions and maternal, sister, and aunt transferences toward the clinician; (c) emotional reactions of Black female clinicians toward Black male adolescents, including feelings of maternal countertransference, protectiveness, worry, and urgency about the clients<e2><80><99> risk factors; (d) challenges in treating Black male adolescents; (e) differences related to treatment settings; (f) differences between working with Black male adolescents and other adolescent populations, including Black females; and (g) supervision and training implications when treating Black male adolescents. Implications for future research indicated the need for additional qualitative and quantitative studies examining same-racial and cross-racial therapeutic dyads in the treatment of this population. Implications for clinicians and training suggested the need to attend to cultural considerations within the therapeutic dyad and in the supervisory relationship, the need to hire a diverse staff, the salience of a clinician<e2><80><99>s <e2><80><9c>use of self<e2><80><9d> when treating Black male adolescents, and the value of consultation with other Black female clinicians.","Stewart, Erica Nicole",0,,1642

2317,"Lecture VII. States of mental enfeeblement (dementia, amentia, psychoparesis, congenital imbecility, idiocy)","We use the term ""mental enfeeblement"" not in its wide and popular sense, meaning any mental weakness or disease whatever, but in a special and scientific sense. It may be defined as ""a general weakening of the mental power, comprising usually a lack of reasoning capacity, a diminution of feeling, a lessened volitional and inhibitory power, a failure of memory, and a want of attention, interest, and curiosity in a person who had those mental qualities and lost them, or has come to the age to have them and they have not been developed."" There are two great physiological periods of mental enfeeblement, viz., in childhood and old age. Consider the condition of a child of two as to reasoning power. There are many words indicating a lack of mental power that have two meanings, a pleasant or an unpleasant one, according as they are used in reference to a child whose mindlessness is physiological, or to a man in whom it would be morbid. What more charming than ""prattle,"" ""artlessness,"" ""childishness,"" ""innocence,"" as applied to a child ? But, said of a man, they mean ""chatter,"" ""silliness,"" ""want of sense,"" or ""unwisdom."" If the brain development is arrested before birth or in childhood, we have congenital imbecility and idiocy-Amentia. Dotage must be reckoned as natural at the end of life. It is not actually the same as senile dementia, but there is no scientific difference. Mental enfeeblement, both in judgment, feeling, memory, and volition, frequently occurs in and after bodily diseases, especially after fevers. It also always occurs in the process of starvation to death. It frequently is seen after the exhaustion of long journeys, great exertions, severe campaigns, and great mental tension, strains, or efforts, such as business crises, sieges, etc. It also occurs after sudden or great emotional shocks, such as loss of children. Now, in all these cases the actual psychological condition may be the very same as in patients laboring under mental diseases proper, or technical insanity. Yet we do not practically reckon them in that category, except they are unusually severe or very lasting. Still, the student of brain function and medical psychology, as well as the practical physician, finds a study of all those conditions of mental enfeeblement most profitable. The conditions of mental enfeeblement that are ordinarily reckoned among mental diseases may exist in every possible degree, from the merest dulling of the keen edge of certain mental faculties up to complete loss of intelligence, feeling, and memory.

2322,THE DYNAMICS OF CREATIVE EXPRESSION AND EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN,"The research program aims to illustrate various teaching and learning methodologies were used in and out of the classroom, to stimulate creative expression, thereby leading to critical thinking and enhancing the innovative learning process in a multicultural learning environment. Through our research program, we will share with our elite audience how we developed our learners' inherent creative talents, using drama, role-play, dialogue making, spontaneous interviews, to name some of the few techniques used during the study. Instead of putting emphasis on rote memorization of data, we encouraged cultivating the imagination. Students were encouraged to demonstrate freely their hidden potentials while using the different procedures introduced during the research. Through our presentation, we will illustrate a number of methodologies used to enhance the creative learning process. Additionally, the study explores the influence of culture, when teaching within an international academic community. We will share authentic experiences, which help to create autonomous critical thinkers and will express the effect of the cultural influences on speakers of English as a second/foreign language (ESL/EFL). Furthermore, the present research has assessed, the reliability and validity of communication as a means to promote understanding and crossing cultural boundaries. The research explores the potential development of interest in intercultural communication attitudes, cross-cultural sensitivity and intercultural awareness, and its ultimate influence on the education environment. Based on research conducted on 107 case studies of Chinese, Thai, Malaysian, Moroccan, Polish, Japanese, French and Indian origin, in a university in Southern China, the importance of sensitivity towards the use of language and cross-cultural curiosity during the education process was generated. The assessment was based on interaction attentiveness, peer assessment, self monitoring and language sensitivity. The test results showed that besides these, many other co-related aspects existed. For instance, an individual's self esteem, attitude towards the inter-cultural communication process, willingness to communicate and acceptability in the communication arena. Results proved, individuals with high scores also showed high Cultural Sensitivity. It established that acquisition of communication skills could not be done in isolation and needed culture studies for the total understanding and appreciation of spoken language as a means of communication. The results showed the case studies expressing an ardent desire to overcome the cultural divides that existed and a strong curiosity for learning the global culture in relation to their countries of origin. The Paper demonstrates the experiential pedagogical aspects of enhancing creative expression while acquiring language skills, using various methodologies in an innovative manner to arouse curiosity and override monotony. The instructional strategies used during the research made the learning process fun, resulting in an increased attendance and receptivity of the students. We invite ardent learners and teachers to attend the presentation to experience the methodologies and add them to their own repertoire of knowledge. The presentation aims to create effective learning environments in a multicultural world.","Singh, C and Gandhioke, S",0,,1647

The first semesters of an engineering curricula focus on developing a solid theoretical basis in Mathematics, Physics and Programming before becoming immersed in practical projects. Therefore, first-year engineering students usually struggle to visualize the practical applications of their studies. Advancing towards an educational model based on competencies, the following workshop was an effort to increase engineering students' engagement and to launch their development at a first stage. This interactive workshop was designed and implemented in an introductory engineering course where students were able to understand how a Star Wars BB8 commercial prototype druid is built and how it works. This droid worked as a great example of a well-know n robot that integrates the different disciplines of the engineering programs involved in the workshop: Mechanical, Industrial, Automotive, Electrical, and Mechatronics. More than 600 freshmen took this workshop, which resulted in satisfactory outcomes. Results suggest that this kind of activity will prevent the abandonment of engineering studies. Students were really engaged in the workshop and showed curiosity and interest in understanding what was inside the famous robot and how it worked, given its innovative design. The students enjoyed the experience and realized the main differences between the engineering disciplines involved according to their application in this practical example.

2326,Curiosity and Interest: The Benefits of Thriving on Novelty and Challenge,"An imbalance exists between the role of curiosity as a motivational force in nearly all human endeavors and the lack of scientific attention given to the topic. In recent years, however, there has been a proliferation of concepts that capture the essence of curiosity-recognizing, seeking out, and showing a preference for the new. In this chapter, we combine this work to address the nature of curiosity, where it fits in the larger scheme of positive emotions, the advantages of being curious in social relationships, links between curiosity and elements of wellbeing, and how it has been used in interventions to improve people's quality of life. Our emphasis is on methodologically sophisticated findings that show how curiosity operates in the laboratory and everyday life, and how, under certain conditions, curiosity can be a profound source of strength or a liability. People who are regularly curious and willing to embrace the novelty, uncertainty, and challenges that are inevitable as we navigate the shoals of everyday life are at an advantage in creating a fulfilling existence compared with their less curious peers.

2330,Onomatopeia and unarticulated language in the translation and production of comic books: A case study: Comics books in Spanish,"The study of unarticulated and onomatopoeic forms has not traditionally received much attention, although this field has sparked interest and curiosity, especially among researchers interested in comic books and those with a particular sensitivity for the problems of language. The number of published works related to this elusive topic is growing, and this article aims to offer a contribution to the study of onomatopoeia in comic books. The author investigates the use of onomatopoeia in comic books in Spanish in recent decades and compares translated with original production. To achieve this end, attention is paid to two different aspects, namely the strategies used by Spanish translators when translating onomatopoeia in source American comics, and the use and creation of onomatopoeic forms in original Spanish comics. Data comes from three sources: American comic books translated into Spanish, comic books originally written in Spanish, and results from a questionnaire on the use of onomatopoeia distributed to Spanish cartoonists and comics writers. The conclusions point to the fact that, since onomatopoeia show the same patterns and similar distribution in original Spanish comics as in those translated from English, it is difficult to ascertain to what extent onomatopoeia in American comics translated into Spanish are 'translated'or simply 'copied'. When English onomatopoeia are retained in translated comics, this may simply mean that they are not perceived as 'foreign'. <c2><a9> Federico Zanettin 2008.","Valero GarcÃ©s, C",0,10.4324/9781315759685-17,1654

Specific interests and orientations, material and intellectual, generally shape the perspective from which we come to define our object of study, and the kinds of knowledge-its form and content, its scope and substance-we pursue. There is now clearly a sense of crisis in the study of media audiences; indeed, the conference that gave rise to this volume called ambiguously for theoretical <e2><80><9c>comprehensiveness,<e2><80><9d> suggesting an awareness of a confusing lack thereof. The crisis is neither purely theoretical nor merely methodological (as misleadingly suggested in the oppositioning of quantitative and qualitative methods); rather, it is both deeply epistemological and thoroughly political. The current popularity of cultural studies approaches to the audience has not only produced considerable epistemological confusion over the status of the concept of <e2><80><9c>audience<e2><80><9d> as an analytical object, but has also reanimated the persistent critical preoccupation with the political standing of scholarship: What does it mean to do <e2><80><9c>audience research,<e2><80><9d> and why do it in the first place?. <c2><a9> 1996 Taylor & Francis.

2334,Childhood career development scale: Scale construction and psychometric properties,"The purpose of this investigation was to construct a theoretically driven and psychometrically sound childhood career development scale to measure career progress in fourth- through sixth-grade children. Super's nine dimensions (i.e., curiosity, exploration, information, key figures, interests, locus of control, time perspective, self-concept, and planfulness) served as the conceptual basis for the construction of this instrument. Principal components analyses indicated the presence of eight empirically derived components with adequate internal consistency. The component structure was largely supported by coefficients of congruence between component loadings from two samples. Gender and grade main and interaction effects for the subscales were analyzed. Implications for theory and research are offered.","Schultheiss, D E P and Stead, G B",0,10.1177/1069072703257751,1657
2336,The early years of Anglo-American co-operation in science,"In the pre-revolutionary period the Royal Society was the main agency serving the scientific interests of the American colonist. The American Fellows of the Royal Society communicated papers to Philosophical Transactions and by corresponding with their colleagues in Britain helped to keep in touch with European developments. At the same time the information and specimens which they sent, or brought to England, helped to satisfy the curiosity of their colleague about the New World. Through the efforts of scientists like Benjamin Franklin, Maskelyne and Joseph Banks some communication was maintained during the War of Independence and co-operation was rapidly restored after it. Nevertheless, American science was profoundly changed by the war and, in spite of some temporary set-backs almost certainly benefited from the revolution. The article also deals with James Smithson and his Institution, and finally with the present flourishing state of Anglo-American co-operation in science. <c2><a9> 1976, Heyden & Son Ltd.","Hodgkin, A",0,10.1179/isr.1976.1.2.109,1658
2337,Review of Young children and their parents: Perspectives from psychoanalytic infant observation,"Reviews the book, Young Children and Their Parents: Perspectives from Psychoanalytic Infant Observation by Gertraud Diem-Wille (see record 2015-22569-000). The aim of this book is to show the importance of the earliest period of childhood for the development of basic emotional patterns of the personality. Some books on developmental psychology ignore or only pay cursory attention to this stage, as the author points out, because the child belongs to private life, is cared for by his parents and has not yet come into contact with public child care institutions or schools. The author used three types of material - observational, clinical, and theoretical - to expound her ideas and the book could be seen as a follow-up - deepening her ideas, demonstrating her great clinical and theoretical experience. The author uses three children as case studies on the path from infancy to the fourth birthday. The author opens the minds of her reader to the richness of everyday experience, encouraging curiosity about the complexity and individuality of each family context and of each young child. Her approach to the subject would interest not only psychoanalysts. The author is concrete when discussing different dimensions of development.

Although this prequestion effect typically applies only to information that was prequestioned and not to other, non-prequestioned information, recent research using short videos found benefits to both prequestioned and non-prequestioned information. In the current study, students viewed authentic video-recorded lectures, each over 20 min, prepared for actual courses on signal detection theory (Experiment 1) and autobiographical memory (Experiment 2). Some students answered prequestions before viewing the videos (prequestion group) and some did not (control group). At final test the prequestion group outperformed the control group overall, as well as specifically for prequestioned information, but performance on non-prequestioned information was either not different from (Experiment 1) or only marginally better than (Experiment 2) the control group. The benefit of prequestions did not interact with subjective interest in the material. These results suggest positive but limited benefits of prequestions for educationally realistic lecture videos.","Toftness, Alexander R and Carpenter, Shana K and Lauber, Sierra and Mickes, Laura",0,10.1016/j.jarmac.2018.06.003,1660

2342,An Empirical Approach to Detection of Topic Bubbles in Tweets,"As Twitter usage increases worldwide, it becomes an important part of the big data ecosystem. People from across the globe tweeting and retweeting a large number of tweets instantaneously results in exponential growth of the information diffusion. This in turn can cause information bubbles. As data from Twitter and other microblogs are used in predictive analytics in many areas such as stock price prediction, varied interpretations of tweets would be necessary for adaptive diffusion analysis. This research is based on the fact that diffusion of information in Twitter has contributed to predictive analytics in other fields. Our research is concerned with the volume and velocity aspects of big data. We propose a new diffusion model for ``topics'' in twitter data. For the sake of simplicity, we assume (without providing formal reasoning) that all properties such as user interest, user familiarity, user curiosity, etc. affecting information diffusion are encoded in the tweet/retweet itself. We suggest a concept of potential for topics and build a time series for analysis. The definition of potential and time series allows to model different scenarios in information diffusion contributed by both volume and velocity of data (tweets). We also introduce the idea of bubble in information diffusion and propose a method to detect bubbles.","Kumar, Ashwin T K and George, K M and Thomas, Johnson P",0,10.1109/BDC.2015.36,1663

2344,Who is using and why: Prevalence and perceptions of using and not using electronic cigarettes in a statewide survey of adults,"A statewide survey examined prevalence, reasons for using, discontinuing use, and not wanting to try e-cigarettes. Methods: Participants (n = 6052) were adult Minnesota residents. E-cigarette initiation and current use prevalence rates were calculated for demographic characteristics and smoking status. The percent of respondents endorsing a reason for trying e-cigarettes are reported overall and by smoking status. The percent of respondents endorsing each reason for discontinuing or not using e-cigarettes are reported for daily and occasional smokers. All descriptive analyses were weighted. To develop profiles of e-cigarette users, a latent class analysis (LCA) was undertaken. Results: Overall, 20.7% of adults reported ever use and 4.6% were current users. Use varied notably by age and smoking status. Only 2.8% of never smokers were current e-cigarette users. Among young adults, 14.6% reported current use but most (70.0%) were never smokers. The reasons given for using e-cigarettes varied by smoking status. Curiosity was the top reason for all groups except recent former smokers, for whom cutting down or quitting other tobacco products was primary. Most smokers discontinuing e-cigarettes preferred cigarettes, and four-fifths of smokers who never tried e-cigarettes lacked interest. From the LCA four profiles were evident: young adult experimenters, curious adults, smokers trying to quit cigarettes, and dual users. Conclusions: Innovative higher nicotine content devices have sustained interest in e-cigarettes especially among young adults and smokers with a goal of cutting down or quitting smoking. Future regulations and communication should focus on reducing e-cigarette use among young adult nonsmokers.

Children born with active bodies and itching minds become staid, dull men and women, their curiosity narrowed to whatever fragments of creation they happen to have seized upon. They hug some stray piece of matter to themselves, crying, ""This is mine,"" as if they feared to lose the little of life within their grasp. Yet all the while earth spreads out and smiles, her myriad creatures moving in response to magnetic and mysterious laws. Suns rise and set, stars gleam across etheric spaces, and love and life are waiting for the free heart and the open mind. Of all the tendencies that obsess man, his egocentricity seems the saddest and somehow the maddest. The world is made up of millions of people with closed minds and a handful of free-thinking personalities. Few men see life as it actually is, for the limitations of mental states, more than the qualifications of intelligence, determine perception. We view reality through the distorting lenses of our mechanisms and measure experiences by our imperfect relation to them. It is probable that for most of us seven-eighths of life is an illusion. Things are not what they seem. They are often the reverse. We become confused, static, smothered in the fog and lose the way to dynamic living.

2346,Jewish Cuba's Contact Zone: Transnational Encounters in Havana's Adath Israel Synagogue,"Immediately following the 1991 constitutional liberalization in which Cuba declared itself to be a secular rather than an atheist state, Adath Israel, Havana's only Orthodox synagogue, re-opened its doors. The synagogue soon welcomed a flow of international travelers, who arrived with enthusiasm, curiosity, and funds. The consequent revitalization of Jewish Cuba has received a disproportionate amount of scholarly, journalistic, and touristic attention in the last 20 years, and global interest in this small community continues to grow. Nevertheless, little explicit analytic attention has been paid to the relationship that has emerged between Jewish Cubans and their international guests.

Its central argument is that Jewish Cuba no longer constitutes a single cultural object of analysis, but rather is best understood as a transnational <e2><80><9c>contact zone,<e2><80><9d> characterized by the tensions and connections of collective affect, a gift economy, and a shifting sense of Jewish belonging.

2347,Relationships of stress responses with plasma oxytocin and prolactin in heifer calves,"Oxytocin and prolactin are potential candidates for the regulation of behavioral and physiological stress responses in the brain. To investigate the neurobiological basis of individual differences in stress responses in cattle, we examined the association of behavioral and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity to acute stressors and basal and stimulated levels of oxytocin and prolactin. Twenty Holstein heifer calves aged 2 weeks were subjected to a 10 min open-field test (OFT) followed by presentation of a feeding bucket for 15 min in the OF. If the calf contacted the bucket, a blast of air was applied to its muzzle (surprise test). Jugular blood samples collected before and after both tests were analyzed for oxytocin, prolactin, and cortisol. Relationships of basal and percent change in oxytocin or prolactin with behavioral responses in each test and percent change in cortisol were analyzed using principal components analysis and Spearman rank correlations. Plasma cortisol and prolactin concentrations were significantly elevated by the tests (p<0.005), but plasma oxytocin concentration did not significantly change (p>0.1). Four principal components explained 56.1% of the total variation: curiosity, general activity, fearfulness, and dependence on humans. Curiosity was inversely correlated with basal oxytocin level (rS=-0.683, p<0.05). General activity was positively correlated with prolactin reactivity (rS=0.448, p<0.05) and inversely with oxytocin reactivity to the novel environment (rS=-0.717, p<0.05). Fearfulness tended to correlate positively with basal oxytocin level (rS=0.583, p<0.1). Dependence on humans correlated with none of the hormonal parameters. The relationships of basal oxytocin level with curiosity and fearfulness for novel environments are of particular interest for future study. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

2348,Review of Cultures of fetishism,"Reviews the book, Cultures of fetishism by Louise J. Kaplan (2006). Kaplan cleverly broadens the concept of fetishism from the traditional sexual defensive displacement to different cultural patterns, such as foot binding, tattoos and psychoanalytic training, among others. Essentially, her central thesis is that fetishism mechanisms rest on the value of allowing us to hold on to familiar objects or ideas, imbued with magical power, to enter the exploration of what is new, unknown and therefore frightening. Although a variety of arguments can easily be raised against the thesis of the book and the application of the concept of fetishism, there is a fascinating curiosity evoked from the ease with which the author moves from primitive to contemporary fields in an interwoven fascinating fabric of challenges and incisive questions. Her style of writing is inviting and always challenging and provocative. The author's reassessment of Freud's sexual view in his paper on Fetishism acquires a different dimension when considering that it was written under the fear of having discovered the cancer of the mouth, the many operations that followed and the replacement with a piece of metal for the hole left in his mouth. The book should be of interest to professionals in many fields, but I particularly recommend it to those who are beginning to consider writing psychoanalytic papers.

2350,Active learning of local predictable representations with artificial curiosity,"In this article, we present some preliminary work on integrating an artificial curiosity mechanism in PROPRE, a generic and modular neural architecture, to obtain online, open-ended and active learning of a sensory-motor space, where large areas can be unlearnable. PROPRE consists of the combination of the projection of the input motor flow, using a self-organizing map, with the regression of the sensory output flow from this projection representation, using a linear regression. The main feature of PROPRE is the use of a predictability module that provides an interestingness measure for the current motor stimulus depending on a simple evaluation of the sensory prediction quality. This measure modulates the projection learning so that to favor the representations that predict the output better than a local average. Especially, this leads to the learning of local representations where an input/output relationship is defined [1]. In this article, we propose an artificial curiosity mechanism based on the monitoring of learning progress, as proposed in [2], in the neighborhood of each local representation. Thus, PROPRE simultaneously learns interesting representations of the input flow (depending on their capacities to predict the output) and explores actively this input space where the learning progress is the higher. We illustrate our architecture on the learning of a direct model of an arm whose hand can only be perceived in a restricted visual space. The modulation of the projection learning leads to a better performance and the use of the curiosity mechanism provides quicker learning and even improves the final performance.","Lefort, Mathieu and Gepperth, Alexander",0,,1671
2351,Evolutionary specializations of primate brain systems,"Primates are distinguished from other mammals by a number of anatomical features, including convergent, close-set orbits; enlarged eyes; digits tipped with nails rather than claws; opposable hallux; and elongated calcaneus (Cartmill, 1992; Martin, 1990; Szalay et al., 1987). These shared, derived characters (synapomorphies) are generally thought to have arisen as adaptations in ancestral (stem) primates for nocturnal activity in the fine, terminal branches of trees (Martin, 1990). The behaviors that drove the evolution of primate anatomical synapomorphies remain at issue, with proposals including visually guided predation on insects and small vertebrates (Allman, 1977; Cartmill, 1972, 1974), foraging on fruits and flowers, in addition to predation (Rasmussen, 1990; Sussman, 1991), and a hindlimb-dominated "" graspleaping"" locomotor pattern (Szalay and Dagosto, 1988). If evolutionary history left its imprint on the primate body, what mark did it leave on the brain? Traditionally, studies of primate brain evolution have focused on changes in brain size and external morphology. Size and external morphology give little indication of evolutionary changes in internal brain organization, however, and, if modern neuroscience teaches us anything, it is that brains are internally structured and compartmentalized to an extraordinary degree. For example, mammalian cerebral cortex is comprised of several large histological domains (iso-, archi-, and paleocortex), each of which consists of multiple smaller divisions (cortical areas), which are composed of smaller, repeating units (modules), which are themselves composed of even smaller, vertically oriented neuronal clusters (minicolumns). Each of these structural compartments is composed of neurons that are connected to other neurons within the same compartment in very particular ways, and which are connected to the neurons of other cortical compartments in very particular ways. Far from being a diffuse neural net, as once was thought, mammalian cerebral cortex exhibits a degree of internal structural complexity unrivaled by any other biological tissue. Given such a view of the brain, it is easy to imagine how evolution might have modified its organization. One might expect, for example, that particular lineages evolved new compartments (areas or modules), or that ancestral mammalian compartments were reorganized internally in distinctive ways in different taxa, or that new systems of connections between compartments evolved in certain groups. In fact, many changes like these did occur during mammalian evolution (reviewed by Preuss, 2000, 2001). We face a considerable obstacle, however, in attempting to reconstruct the brain changes that accompanied primate origins-the paucity of comparative information. As a group, neuroscientists are inclined to concentrate their research on a few model animal taxa, under the assumption that the important features of mammalian brain organization are shared among mammals. In keeping with the modern biomedical research paradigm, neuroscientists have come to treat animals as standardized materials for exploring the organization of ""the brain""-as though there were only one brain-rather than as resources for exploring the diversity of brains (Logan, 1999, 2001; Preuss, 2000; see also Raff, 1996). The result is while the brains of a select few taxa-especially rats and macaque monkeys-have been studied in great detail; much less effort has been devoted to other mammalian taxa. This places great limitations on our ability to reconstruct primate brain evolution. Fortunately, neuroscience has maintained a small cadre of investigators willing to buck the trend, maintaining an interest in evolution and a curiosity about differences in mammalian brain organization. A central figure in this group is Irving T. Diamond (see, for example, Diamond, 1973; Diamond and Hall, 1969). Diamond was greatly influenced by the writings of Elliot Smith and Le Gros Clark, and devoted himself to developing an evolutionary neuroscience of mammals. Moreover, he conveyed his enthusiasm for evolution to the very talented graduate students he attracted. Diamond, his students, and their associates have been responsible for a remarkable fraction of all the comparative studies of mammalian brain organization that have been published over the last 35 years. It is largely due to the efforts of these individuals that we know anything at all about the brains of strepsirhine primates, tree shrews, bats, and insectivores, and are therefore in a position to say something about the evolution of primate brain systems. This review is founded upon earlier works focusing on brain evolution at the level of structures and systems, particularly those of Allman (1977), Kaas (1980), Kaas and Preuss (1993), Pettigrew (1986; Pettigrew et al., 1989), Preuss (1993, 1995a), and Preuss and Kaas (1999). However, effort has been made to provide a more comprehensive and synthetic treatment of the subject of primate brain specializations than has previously been attempted. Many readers will, I fear, find the enumeration of neuroanatomical details rather too comprehensive for their liking. This degree of specificity is necessary, however, to illustrate the great number and variety of changes in brain organization that accompanied primate origins. Moreover, the very fact that neural changes were so numerous has important implications for students of behavioral evolution. <c2><a9> Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.","Preuss, T M",0,10.1007/978-0-387-33507-0_18,1672
2352,Review of Object lessons,"Reviews the book, Object Lessons by Robyn Wiegman (2012). Object Lessons is a profoundly pedagogic book. By which I mean: it is a book that teaches us how we are taught. Our teachers can be our objects of study. If we are investing in learning we can also learn from our investments. Different chapters follow specific objects (women, gender, intersectionality, whiteness, sexuality, queer, the transnational) as the scene or site of a lesson, which is to say, as the scene or site of a struggle over the terms of engagement. This is a curious book: a book that responds to our own programs and institutions with curiosity. There is an ethics to this curiosity: Wiegman shows us compellingly and gently how our own work is worth being curious about. This book considers the desires at stake when an academic field is motivated by a sense of social justice. Its interest is not to produce a theory of desire cleverly, the psychoanalytic frames that might ask us to put this theory first, that is, a theory of the formation of the subject, but rather a theory of how objects come to matter or keep their hold. One of the strengths of this book is the attention to recovery as a form of narrative: how for instance we might employ certain critical moves in order to recover from the perceived limitation of a category of thought. This book invites us to consider how terms such as 'identity' have careers. Although the book focuses more on 'identity knowledges' rather than 'identity politics' it again gives us the resources to speculate on other terms in its terms. The referencing of the book within the book happens with greater frequency towards the end: and it is of course an academic convention when summating to present books as the author rather than as authorized (perhaps this is a sign of our readiness to identify ourselves with our work). However, as a reader it can end up feeling as if the book has become about itself: that the book is about the creation of an-itself. Perhaps this bookish sense is how the book performs the argument that Wiegman is making: objects come right back at us, just when we think we are letting them go.

2354,Consuming criminal corpses: Fascination with the dead criminal body,"The body of the criminal has long held a macabre fascination. From the earliest times to the nineteenth century, the public execution of criminals in Britain and America drew large crowds to witness the punishment being carried out. Even after the termination of public executions, the fascination with death through the criminal corpse has continued. This is demonstrated by a tourist-like interest and curiosity emerging to the extent of celebrated status being attained by certain criminals and their deaths. This article engages with the macabre fascination and celebration of death and the criminal corpse by exploring the gruesome tourism and pursuit of souvenirs relating to specific dead criminals in Britain and America. Using a broad sweep of case studies dating between 1800 and the 1970s - including Scottish body snatchers Burke and Hare, and murderers, William Corder, and Gary Gilmore - the enthralment with the criminal corpse will be examined and conceptualised. I draw on Seltzer's notion of wound culture, whereby society is fascinated and thrilled with violence and death, to argue that the consumption of criminal corpses is a grisly aspect of contemporary consumer culture in which even the macabre can gain celebrated, or celebrity, status. <c2><a9> 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Penfold-Mounce, R",0,10.1080/13576275.2010.496618,1674
2359,Stories to tell? Narrative tools in museum education texts,"Background: In the 1950s and 1960s, many children experienced museums as dull and boring. Nowadays, museums seem to be much more conscious of their educational role and the need to make their exhibits attractive and interesting. Making use of narratives is one way of achieving this. Some scholars claim that narrative is central to meaning making in a learning context. This article illustrates the extent to which narratives are used in a museum learning context, the kinds of narratives used and their purpose. Purpose: The overall aim was to investigate the versatility of narratives in a learning and meaning-making context in a museum setting. The three-pronged research question is: to what extent is narrative used in the education texts produced by three selected museums and made available on their Internet websites, what kinds of narratives are used and what is their purpose? Method: Data was gathered in January and February 2006, following an extensive Internet search of Swedish museums and their downloadable education texts. Three museums were selected - Skansen, the Swedish Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of Science and Technology - each publishing a comprehensive up-to-date selection of education texts on their websites. A total of 134 digital texts specifically produced for students and teachers in connection with museum visits were studied and analysed. Each text was downloaded, sorted, labelled, saved and categorised electronically. The texts catered for different ages: infant and primary school (7-10 years), middle school (10-13 years) and secondary school (13-16 years). Analysis: A preliminary analysis strategy was developed on the basis of texts from the first museum chosen. Detailed adjustments to the analysis framework were made prior to a full analysis of the texts. Every downloaded text was read and re-read and documented according to the kind of narratives contained and their supposed purpose. Results: An analysis of the web-based education texts indicated that not only did the museums make use of narratives to different extents, but that different kinds of narratives were used for different purposes. Depending on the kind of narrative used, the results showed that the main purposes were to communicate by: (1) describing, constructing or reconstructing information; (2) interpreting what has happened, is happening now or might happen in the future; (3) constructing reality and making sense or meaning of it; (4) stimulating the imagination and encouraging creativity; (5) rendering teaching and learning more entertaining, imaginative and effective; and (6) acting as a resource to aid interaction, negotiation and communication. It was also apparent that the chosen museums used narrative to differing degrees depending on their respective traditions and circumstances. Conclusion: The study highlighted how the narratives used in the three museums' web-based education texts make a significant contribution to meaning making by stimulating imagination, encouraging reflection, drawing on existing experience and knowledge and sharpening visitors' curiosity. This is mainly achieved through the narratives' powers of description and analysis, and their ability to challenge existing attitudes and involve the visitor in historical and contemporary events and situations.","Frykman, Sue Glover",0,10.1080/00131880903156898,1675
2360,FROM 2-DIMENSIONAL TO 3-DIMENSIONAL CURIOSITY - A REANALYSIS OF,This study employs confirmatory factor analysis techniques to reanalyse the correlation matrix computed from the data gathered by Ainley (1985). The data consisted of 227 teacher education students from different tertiary colleges. Ainley used five (12 subscales) frequently used questionnaire measures of curiosity in her study. The purpose of the present study was to test the statistical fit of the two-factor model of curiosity subsuming two styles - breadth of interest and depth of interest. Application of goodness-of-fit indexes offered by the LISREL program revealed that the two-factor orthogonal model fitted the data poorly. Using confirmatory factor analysis in an exploratory fashion a tentative three-factor confirmatory factor model was constructed. The third factor can be labelled as `'venturesomeness'' or `'physical thrill-seeking''. The fit of the three-factor model was significantly better statistically than the two-factor model. With the help of a specification search it was still possible to improve the fit of the three-factor model.,"BYMAN, R",0,10.1080/00049539308259133,1676
2361,The Perceptions of Students Studying in the Faculty of Education towards Reading in Terms of Their Reading Motivations,"The research was conducted with the aim of determining the levels of reading motivation of students who are studying in the department of teaching in terms of various variables and the factors that cause having low and high reading motivation. The research is based on the determination of the internal and external motivation sources that motivate or disincline students in reading who are studying in the department of teaching and the development of solutions accordingly. The research was conducted with mixed method. Within the mixed method, the explanatory sequential design was used. The first study group of the research consists of 238 first grade students who are studying in the different departments of the Faculty of Education in a state university in the academic year of 2018-2019. The second study group of the research consists of 18 students who wanted to participate in the second phase of the research and has low and high reading motivation. The data collection tools of the study include the Adult Reading Motivation Scale (ARMS) which was developed by Schutte and Malouff (2007) and interview form which consists of open-ended questions. In the analysis of the quantitative data, within the IBM SPSS statistical program, descriptive researches, independent samples t-test since the data demonstrate normal distribution and one-way ANOVA test were used. In the analysis of qualitative data, MAXQDA Analytics Pro 12 qualitative analysis program was used for coding the data, determining the themes, organizing the themes and defining and interpreting the findings. The obtained results are as follows: Reading motivation of female students are higher than male students. Students who have a bookcase in their home have a higher motivation than those who don't have. The department students study does not create a difference in reading motivation. Students who have high reading motivation define themselves as conscious readers and individuals who find pleasure in reading. Personal pleasure and the desire to improve are the leading factors that incline individuals to read. It is observed that taking someone as a model and being influenced by a peer are important for reading motivation. The leading reasons that decrease reading motivation are school, activities with friends and getting bored from reading. Students who have high reading motivation are considered to be individuals who acquired reading habit and are good readers since they read with the purposes of self-development, acquiring knowledge, homework and pleasure as well as curiosity. While the factors which excite students the most in reading are curiosity, interest and gripping narration, the elements that disturb the students are long descriptions and unobtrusive subjects. It is recommended that families and teachers should be role models and guidance should be given in book selection and appropriate reading environment should be established in increasing reading motivation. It is also recommended that students make readings with peer groups.","Teksan, Keziban",0,,1677
2362,Group processes: A developmental perspective,"My decision to write a second edition of Group Processes was based on the hope that by describing what is known and what remains to be learned about groups, I might contribute to what is becoming a worldwide conversation. The purpose of this book, then, is threefold. First, it seeks to integrate research and theory about group processes and development and, where appropriate, make applications to individuals and larger social systems. Second, it attempts to fire the imagination and curiosity of its readers in relation to the wonders and dangers of group and social influences on our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Third, it hopes to encourage people to apply what they learn to support and enhance the functioning of the groups to which they belong. Hogan (1975) stated that the survival of early man was not dependent on the development of superior individuals. Rather, human survival was, and is, dependent on the development of effective groups capable of meeting new challenges. It follows, then, that it is in our best interest to understand the dynamics of groups and other social processes if we hope to ensure the quality and continuation of human life.

2363,Letter to the editor,"Comments on an article by D. Herbenick et al. (see record 2010-00488-007) regarding women's vibrator use in sexual partnerships. It is an important study because it demonstrates that partnered vibrator use is common among heterosexual, lesbian, and bisexual women. It is not incorrect to estimate that the numbers of either partnered or single use of vibrators would increase in the near future because of (a) increased availability through the Internet and adult stores, (b) increased curiosity on the subject caused by media interest, and (c) the general demand of people to derive the most out of sexuality. While enhancing sexual gratification with vibrator usage, basic steps of genital hygiene and precautions against sexually transmitted diseases and genital trauma should not be omitted. It would have been very exciting if Herberick et al. had collected and presented additional data about the precautions taken during vibrator use against genital trauma and sexually transmitted diseases, since they had a rather large study population.

2364,YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT QUESTION YOU ARE GOING TO ANSWER: CREATING EFFECTIVE,"Case studies in business management have been used as an effective approach and tool for enhancing students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills by providing opportunities for them to apply appropriate theories, concepts and models for real world issues faced by organisations. Despite the popularity of the case study approach in business and management education, it is self evident that the effective use of case studies to achieve above mentioned benefits is challenging and problematic mainly due to the fact that case studies are misused and abused in different ways, including just adopting a popular method, just asking students to read and answer the questions, or not creating conducive environment for interactive and active learning sessions. This challenge has been widen and deepen as there is very limited empirical research on improving students learning and performance by effective utilisation of case studies. Research that does exist has primarily focused on student perceptions of their learning rather than on actual learning outcomes (1). This paper explores some empirical evidence with regard to effective utilisation of case studies in lectures and tutorial classes as a means of providing opportunities for postgraduate level students to understand concepts, theories and real world example and subsequent evaluation of performance as a part of the final examination. We conducted this exploratory study over a period of 3 years in an Australian university by using lecturer's experiences, examining and changing case study discussion practices, computing case study section performance at the final exam, and using voluntary feedback and comments provided by students from time to time. As we found different ways and approaches used by several lecturers to discuss case studies, we compared students learning and performance before and after methodological intervention affected for two years. We discovered a high level of impact of changes on students' learning and performance when case studies were integrated into a part of the teaching, learning, and evaluation process by providing equal opportunity for every student to engage in active learning. Our approach consisted of creating a positive tension and competition among both individuals and groups and then providing marks and constructive feedback on the same day of presentation (2). Performance data and students experience revealed that they were engaging in active learning and could add a lot of realism to the class. We therefore argue that the use of case studies needs to be made meaningful and interesting through innovative methods. Our experience also suggests that lecturers and tutors have a critical role in selecting appropriate cases, developing a good tutorial plan, creating effective tension, curiosity, and a moderate level of competition among students for active engagement in learning and participation, providing appropriate support and feedback, and adopting coherent and credible assessment criteria to assess performance. Hence, the use of case studies in teaching and learning requires richness of content, process and context that inspire students' interest and commitment in their learning aimed at enhancing overall performance.","Chandrakumara, A and Wickramasinghe, A",0,,1680
2365,The Effects of Songs on Foreign Language Vocabulary Acquisition,"The aim of this study is to investigate the role of songs on vocabulary learning. The study was conducted on 60 students of different grades in the department of English Language Teaching at Faculty of Education, Sakarya University. The participants consisted of both male and female students between the ages of 19 and 29. A questionnaire with 23 items developed by Xiaowei was administered as the data collection instrument. As clearly known, language learners with musical intelligence make use of songs and lyrics in the process of learning a foreign language. Learners who are keen on learning a foreign language can practice informal language incidentally by means of repeating the words of various songs. Language of music is also a clear representative of culture and undeniable transmitter of cultures across continents. Learning by means of songs establishes a stress-free atmosphere and eliminates the affective filter which minimizes learning when it is high. Furthermore, listening to songs can help English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners overcome psychological barriers such as; anxiety and lack of confidence since learners actively get involved in self-learning. Thus, songs are entertaining, motivating and easily accessible materials. The findings of the study revealed that learning vocabulary from songs is an effective way and songs assist learners in learning pronunciation, spelling, meaning and usage in varying degrees as they arouse learners' interest and curiosity. It can easily be assumed that curiosity is the key point which leads language learners to acquiring new vocabulary through getting exposed to songs.","Kocaman, Orhan",0,,1681
2367,Cultural identity among urban American Indian/Alaska Native youth: Implications for alcohol and drug use,"American Indian / Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth exhibit high rates of alcohol and other drug (AOD) use, which is often linked to the social and cultural upheaval experienced by AI/ANs during the colonization of North America. Urban AI/AN youth may face unique challenges, including increased acculturative stress due to lower concentrations of AI/AN populations in urban areas. Few existing studies have explored cultural identity among urban AI/AN youth and its association with AOD use. This study used systematic qualitative methods with AI/AN communities in two urban areas within California to shed light on how urban AI/AN youth construct cultural identity and how this relates to AOD use and risk behaviors. We conducted 10 focus groups with a total of 70 youth, parents, providers, and Community Advisory Board members and used team-based structured thematic analysis in the Dedoose software platform. We identified 12 themes: intergenerational stressors, cultural disconnection, AI/AN identity as protective, pan-tribal identity, mixed racial-ethnic identity, rural vs. urban environments, the importance of AI/AN institutions, stereotypes and harassment, cultural pride, developmental trajectories, risks of being AI/AN, and mainstream culture clash. Overall, youth voiced curiosity about their AI/AN roots and expressed interest in deepening their involvement in cultural activities. Adults described the myriad ways in which involvement in cultural activities provides therapeutic benefits for AI/AN youth. Interventions that provide urban AI/AN youth with an opportunity to engage in cultural activities and connect with positive and healthy constructs in AI/AN culture may provide added impact to existing interventions.

2370,"School geography: what interests students, what interests teacher?","There is evidence indicating that students are rarely asked about what they want to learn, but when they are asked, the students readily identify topics of personal relevance with a hands-on component. They want topics that are curiosity-based and not knowledge based. This paper draws on data that gave voice to 199 students studying geography and their teachers. A short survey explored students<e2><80><99> interest in a variety of topics commonly found in geography curriculum documents. Interviews were used to increase reliability and validity. The analysis of the survey followed a Whole Group Mean Score and allowed for the generation of a ranked order of topics from which zones of High Interest, Low Interest, and Ambivalence were determined. The central issue that this paper addresses is that there is a misalignment in the topics that students find of interest to learn about, and those that their teachers find of interest to teach about. It is postulated that a better fit between curriculum and students<e2><80><99> interests could lead to improved cognitive and affective geographical learning outcomes, as well as an increase in geography enrolments. <c2><a9> 2017, <c2><a9> 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Kidman, G",0,10.1080/10382046.2017.1349374,1683
2371,Motivating Students in the Middle Years,"This article reports that educators are still searching for the right blend of academic and developmental strategies for middle school students. More than a decade after a prominent group of middle-grades reformers set out to infuse higher academic standards into what critics deemed the touchy-feely world of middle schools, many teachers are still grappling with ways to motivate students to excel intellectually while helping them adapt to the dramatic physical and emotional changes that come with puberty. That mix of rigor, relevance, and responsiveness, experts say, is crucial for guiding students, particularly those most at risk of dropping out, on the path to high school graduation and later success. Too many schools serving 6th through 9th graders, however, have yet to find the right prescription for keeping those youngsters engaged at a time when their growing curiosity, independence, and need for the acceptance of their peers may lead them to act out or zone out in school.","Manzo, Kathleen Kennedy",0,,1684

A branching story was created with hyperlinks built into a Powerpoint story. The young readers could interact with options at different turning points of the story, which activated the readers' curiosity, and promoted their decision making and thinking skills. The study was carried out in an all-girl school, Saudi Arabia. A class of 20 fourth-graders participated in the study. For data collection and analyses, the students were assigned into four groups based on their previous reading achievements and interests. Students' responses to comprehension questions were tabulated. The unit-end survey results were analyzed. A majority of the participating students overwhelmingly enjoyed the experience. They were motivated to achieve the project goals sooner than planned. Kinesthetic learners demonstrated their academic potentials well beyond their performance under the traditional reading instruction.","Alduraby, Hanan and Liu, Jane",0,,1685
2374,The motivational propensity and consistency of EFL undergraduate students in selecting research topic and design: A longitudinal narrative inquiry,"Purpose: The selection of the research topic and design crucially determines the success of conducting a research. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the process by which undergraduate students select their research topic and design, as viewed from the lens of motivation theory proposed by Ryan and Deci (2000), which focuses on motivational propensity and consistency. Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal narrative inquiry was employed to address the gap. In total, 10 Indonesian graduates from different educational backgrounds were purposively selected. The interview focused on their longitudinal experiences from the freshman period to skripsi (undergraduate thesis) supervision period. Data analysis included inductive thematic analysis, member checking by the researchers, and cross-checking by the participants. Findings: The motivational propensity and consistency in selecting research topic and design are highly dynamic. Specifically, autonomy, high curiosity, self-reflection of past interest and perceived competence, and library research become the major factors toward the manifestation of intrinsic motivation in the selected topics and designs. Meanwhile, friends<e2><80><99> preferences, lecturer<e2><80><99>s expertise and suggestion, and unclear input from the relevant previous courses result in the manifestation of various types of external motivation. Practical implications: Therefore, the implementation of dialogic discussion might be more effective when tensions prevail between the department, academic advisor or skripsi supervisors, and students with respect to the selected topics and designs. Moreover, the provision of constructive tasks like case studies, group discussion, and/or research proposal writing can be applied in research methodology course to enhance their repertoire about research topic and design. Autonomy and self-reflection should become the driving objectives. Originality/value: The exploration of the issue has to be intensively oriented toward prescriptive handbook development in selecting research topic and design.

Diamond's writing style is easy to understand and pleasurable to read. She motivates curiosity and create arcs that build on each other providing the reader with the background knowledge necessary to understand Diamond's discussion of the implications of her research. For sex therapists and other clinicians, the book provides a new conceptual tool that could be used to inform client work or be used directly with clients. For activists and researchers, Diamond provides a new perspective that could ""alter how researchers think about and conduct research on sexual development and what types of data are considered most relevant"". Diamond focuses on concrete ways that her research can be used to continue an exploration of human sexuality.

2376,The art-principle as represented in poetry,"The essay was read before the Channing Auxiliary Society of San Francisco, October, 1894. The subject which is to engage us this morning, ladies and gentlemen, has been stated in your programme by a title, just read, which fits in naturally with your whole present Course, on Art in its General Principles and its Particular Phases. The title describes the actual contents of my essay rather more accurately than the one chosen for it when it was first written nine years ago. It was then called The Essential Principle of Poetic Art? There is still a use in turning your attention to this former title; it will afford us a rather more significant starting- point. To most of you, I dare say, it would seem more natural to speak of the essential principles of poetic art, so many cooperating conditions, of course, must go to the making of poetry. But I purposely leave the main word of the earlier title in the singular. To follow to the end the varied conditions of poetic power, in all their diverging multitude, time would wholly fail us. We must content ourselves with an endeavour to find the single determining principle from which they all arise. But is there any such single principle? We must confess this seems unlikely, when we contemplate the confusing diversity of the actual species of poetry. Not to speak of a common originative principle, it hardly looks probable, at first sight, that there should be common to the varieties of poetry anything important at all,--to the epic, the dramatic, the lyric, the didactic; the tragic, the comic; the heroic, the sentimental; the meditative, the sportive; the elegiac, the satirical; the classic, the romantic. And if we turn from the form and mood of the poetry to its subject and contents,--to love and war, to myriad-visaged Nature and the ""marvellous heart of man,"" to joy and sorrow, glory and shame, to ""the loud laugh that speaks the vacant mind,"" and to ""those thoughts that wander through eternity,""--the belief in the unity of the poetic spirit becomes still more difficult. How can diversity so wide be reduced to unity? How can a single principle provide for such manifold effects, or preserve its identity through such an infinitude of variations--variations that go to the extreme of embracing opposites? To satisfy these wonderings, and dispose of them, is doubtless part of our business in the effort to ascertain the essential principle of poetry. But this theoretical aim of our inquiry is not its only aim; there is a practical interest to be served by it, too. The theory, to be sure, might if attained yield us the pleasure of a gratified curiosity; but we may rightly demand of such an inquiry that it furnish us with a discipline in culture, and with a permanent canon of taste. If its result is real, this should put us in possession of a touchstone by which not only to sift the pretensions of a production that professes to be poetry, but to discriminate between works undoubtedly poetic, and to assign to each its place according to its merits. Our question, then, is not simply whether there is a single essential principle of poetic art, and what it is; but, more pertinently, just what the subtle quality is that makes a poem a poem, and determines, by the degree of its presence, the rank of any poem in the great company of poems.

2377,Curiosity and interest: Emergence and divergence,"This article explores the relation between curiosity and interest by examining how in-the-moment experiences of curiosity and of interest emerge out of exploratory behavior observed in infancy and early childhood. As experiential states, there is little to distinguish curiosity and interest. Descriptions of developing interests that refer to ""curiosity questions"" and ""curiosity episodes,"" suggest that experiential states of curiosity and interest are intertwined in interest development. However, when the focus is on individual differences, curiosity and interest diverge. Trait curiosity is a relatively stable personality trait, the propensity to feel curious in contexts high in collative variability. On the other hand, interests or individual interest refer to a disposition or predisposition to engage and re-engage with contents of a specific domain. It is suggested that further insight into the significance of curiosity and interest for educational practice will come from expanding real-time analyses of the quality of the experiential states they subsume.

2378,Recent statistical advances,"Of the current arsenal of statistical procedures available to psychological researchers, one of the most adaptable, albeit rigorous, is that of structural equation modeling (SEM). Indeed, the growth of SEM over the past 35 years or so is nothing short of phenomenal. Within the framework of the social sciences, at least, it has evolved from being a mere whisper in the early 1970s, a curiosity in the late 1970s, a practice of questionable repute in the 1980s, and a hot statistical procedure in the 1990s to its current status as a powerful and sound methodology capable of providing answers to a broad spectrum of research questions. A review of the psychological literature across this time span reveals an ever-increasing number of journal articles in which SEM applications have been used to address an array of substantive as well as methodological issues. SEM, in general, together with more recent advances in this methodology, in particular, lend themselves well to topics of interest within the context of multicultural research. My primary intent in this chapter, then, is to describe three of these advanced SEM statistical methodologies and identify ways by which each can address important research questions bearing on multicultural populations. Although I focus on racial and ethnic groups in the United States, the methods discussed are equally applicable to cross-cultural and cross-national comparisons. The methodological strategies I highlight are confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and path analytic invariance modeling, latent growth curve (LGC) modeling, and multilevel (ML) modeling. Because each of these analytic strategies represents a specific SEM application and because some readers may be unfamiliar with SEM, I begin this chapter with a brief description of SEM methodology in general.

2379,Managing University Intellectual Property in the Public Interest,"Thirty years ago federal policy underwent a major change through the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which fostered greater uniformity in the way research agencies treat inventions arising from the work they sponsor. Before the Act, if government agencies funded university research, the funding agency retained ownership of the knowledge and technologies that resulted. However, very little federally funded research was actually commercialized. As a result of the Act's passage, patenting and licensing activity from such research has accelerated. Although the system created by the Act has remained stable, it has generated debate about whether it might impede other forms of knowledge transfer. Concerns have also arisen that universities might prioritize commercialization at the expense of their traditional mission to pursue fundamental knowledge--for example, by steering research away from curiosity-driven topics toward applications that could yield financial returns. To address these concerns, the National Research Council convened a committee of experts from universities, industry, foundations, and similar organizations, as well as scholars of the subject, to review experience and evidence of the technology transfer system's effects and to recommend improvements. The present volume summarizes the committee's principal findings and recommendations. <c2><a9> 2011 by the National Academy of Sciences.

In recent years, the NPM has been shifting its operational focus from being object-oriented to being public-centered, and the museum has held not only the physical forms of artifacts and documents but also their digital images and metadata. These changes would inject new life into historical artifacts. In addition, archives as its collections would be given a refreshingly new image to the public and become connected with people's daily lives. Among these endeavors for displaying historical artifacts online and prevailing Chinese culture in the modern age, the key issues are related to digital technology applications and service innovations. The service innovations would be further divided into information and communication technologies (ICT)-enabled ones and non-ICT-enabled ones. These shifts clearly claim that adopting digital technologies and innovative services can bring positive impacts to the museum. The NPM administrative team wants to keep infusing life into ancient artifacts and texts, sustaining curiosities of the public for Chinese culture and history, and invoking their interests to visit the NPM in person. However, to develop for the future while reviewing the past, the NPM administrative team has to meditate on the next steps in terms of implementation of service innovations. Expected learning outcomes: Students will learn motivations of digital establishment and service innovations from the organization perspective and the necessities of technological implementation. Students will understand the difference in innovations between ICT-enabled services and non-ICT-enabled services. Students would be able to understand the process of developing a new service. Students will be aware of challenges the organization would face in developing a new service. Supplementary materials: Teaching notes are available for educators only.

2382,More than myth: The developmental significance of romantic relationships during adolescence,"Adolescents' romantic relationships have attracted popular interest, but, until recently, little scientific curiosity Research has been impeded by erroneous assumptions that adolescent relationships are trivial and transitory, that they provide little information beyond measures of the influence of parent-child and peer relationships, and that their impact is primarily associated with problems of behavior and adjustment. This article proposes that distinguishing five features of romantic relationships (involvement, partner selection, relationship content, quality, and cognitive and emotional processes) is essential to describing adolescents' relationships and their developmental significance. These distinctions also help to clarify the role of context, age-related variations, and individual differences in the impact of romantic experiences. Research is needed to illuminate questions of how and under what conditions romantic relationships affect individual development and how romantic and other close relationships jointly influence developmental trajectories during adolescence.","Collins, W A",0,10.1111/1532-7795.1301001,1693
2384,A further attempt to measure the strength of instincts,"This paper describes an attempt to work out the idea of using a conative basis for the measurement of instincts. The test used was the piling up of dominoes one on top of the other; the subjects were demonstration-school children ranging in age from three to six years; the incentives in the order in which they were applied were: competition, food-seeking, curiosity, self-competition. The numerical results obtained were confirmed by examples of behavior, a change in the level of performance in each test being accompanied by a corresponding change in the amount of interest or effort shown by the children. The resultant weighted average scores were as follows: food-seeking, 31.4; curiosity, 26.6; competition, 25.7. (For self-competition no equivalent figure is available.) The food-seeking test was the only test in which nervousness and outside distractions evidently lowered the score, that the examples of behavior expressing interest and effort were more numerous throughout it, and that during it no instances at all were shown of behavior expressing lack of interest. The results from the competition test appeared to show that with young children the competitor is regarded as a companion rather than as an opponent. Bearing in mind the variety in the general type of behavior of one child as compared with another (a variety probably the result of differences in temperament, together with such other factors as the pronounced differences in the methods of working and differences in age and intelligence) the group reactions noted in the course of the experiment are significant. In the opinion of the writer, they suggest that the incentive aroused some conative impulse common to the group of children, and that the ensuing behavior gave some indication of its strength.

They then identify a primary source (an object, document, map, or image) that will be used to introduce the unit using the See, Think, Wonder method (Fontichiaro 2010). The focus of the activity is to elicit what students already know through a series of three scaffolded questions of increasing difficulty. Three versions of this activity, for various age groups, are described. Each uses the See, Think, Wonder method for discussion of primary sources.","Fontichiaro, Kristin",0,,1696
2388,Counterfactual curiosity in preschool children,"We investigated whether young children are curious about what could have been (''counterfactual curiosity''). In two experiments, children aged 4 and 5 years (N=32 in Experiment 1, N=24 in Experiment 2) played a matching game in which they turned over cards in the hope that they matched a picture. After choosing a card, children could use ``x-ray glasses'' to uncover unchosen cards. In Experiment 1, most children spontaneously used the glasses to peek at past alternatives, even when the outcome could no longer be altered. In Experiment 2, children concentrated their information search on alternatives that were within their control. In both experiments, children showed greater interest in counterfactual outcomes when the card they chose turned out not to match the picture. The findings suggest that young children are curious not only about what is but also about what could have been. Curiosity about alternative outcomes seems to precede counterfactual reasoning.

2389,Assessing collective affect recognition via the Emotional Aperture Measure,"Curiosity about collective affect is undergoing a revival in many fields. This literature, tracing back to Le Bon's seminal work on crowd psychology, has established the veracity of collective affect and demonstrated its influence on a wide range of group dynamics. More recently, an interest in the perception of collective affect has emerged, revealing a need for a methodological approach for assessing collective emotion recognition to complement measures of individual emotion recognition. This article addresses this need by introducing the Emotional Aperture Measure (EAM). Three studies provide evidence that collective affect recognition requires a processing style distinct from individual emotion recognition and establishes the validity and reliability of the EAM. A sample of working managers further shows how the EAM provides unique insights into how individuals interact with collectives. We discuss how the EAM can advance several lines of research on collective affect.","Sanchez-Burks, Jeffrey and Bartel, Caroline A and Rees, Laura and Huy, Quy",0,10.1080/02699931.2015.1015968,1698
2390,The Personal and Interpersonal Benefits of Rediscovery,"Individuals commonly fail to document their current experiences such that they often forget about these experiences altogether. In the context of learning, for example, experts may have difficulty remembering the experience of being inexperienced, making it difficult for them to help and train novices. Across three chapters, I explore the personal and interpersonal benefits of rediscovery---the process of revisiting past experiences that are non-salient or inaccessible in the moment. In the first chapter, I test whether individuals understand the benefits of rediscovery for themselves. Using a time capsule paradigm, I demonstrate that rediscovering past experiences, particularly ordinary ones, generates more interest and curiosity than expected. Whereas the first chapter focuses on the benefits of rediscovery at the individual level, the second and third chapters explore the interpersonal benefits of rediscovery. In the second chapter, studies with interns and medical students demonstrate that relative to relying on memories of past experiences, rediscovering these experiences (e.g., by reading their past accounts of these events) better equips individuals to understand and advise those with less experience. In the third chapter, a study of expert guitarists reveals that rediscovering the experience of inexperience enables experts to better relate to novices, helping them give advice that novices rate as more helpful and encouraging.

Unfortunately, the recommended items will soon become too familiar to the user and hence fail to arouse her interest. Discovery-oriented recommendation systems (DORSs) complement accuracy with discover utilities (DUs) such as novelty and diversity and optimize the tradeoff between the DUs and accuracy of the recommendations. Unfortunately, DORSs ignore an important fact that different users have different appetites for DUs. That is, highly curious users can accept highly novel and diversified recommendations whereas conservative users would behave in the opposite manner.

2394,Exploring the contributions of informal science experiences to learners science identity development,"The research presented here was designed to explore the relationship of informal experiences and the development of science identity as well as characterize these science learning experiences. This research was conducted through mixed methods, including five data sources 1) a survey, 2) participant drawings, 3) interviews transcripts, 4) concept webs and 5) artifacts collected from 196 science and non-science degree-seeking college students enrolled at an urban research intensive university located in the southeastern United States. The analytical approach relied heavily on the qualitative data (participant drawings and interviews) and was augmented by information provided by the survey. A comparison of survey results and activities depicted in the drawings revealed inconsistencies in the activities portrayed. Although drawings depicted many of the activities listed including sports and cooking, a large portion of the activities listed on the survey were not represented in the drawings. This suggested that the participants did not view many of the activities identified on the survey (i.e., bike riding, video games, board games, Legos, care of animals, museum visits) as scientific. This calls into question the ability of the `Science Background Experiences Survey' (Bulunuz & Jarrett, 2009) to capture engagement with activities the participants perceive as scientific. Drawing results identified characteristics of out-of-school science experiences including: those identified as biological (animals, plants, health), outdoor locations (beach, forest, ocean) and activities that were performed with or without others. In addition, making observations and sense making techniques were two practices commonly employed during the activities depicted in the drawings. The two activities most commonly identified in the drawings were cooking and sports. The identification of these two activities suggests that although significant informal science educational research focuses on designed spaces (i.e., museums), the activities participants in most frequently were truly ""free-choice"". Results indicated two primary enactments of science identity: consumer and interest. Evidence of being a science consumer included use of tools and processing of ideas. Demonstrations of interest were identified through expressions that indicated curiosity. Although the science identity literature indicates the role of science critic as an additional demonstration of science identity, there was only limited evidence of this practice in these data. Interview participants indicated enactment of science identity on three levels: low moderate and high. Patterns of activity for these three levels of science identity followed patterns of enactment, i.e., participants who demonstrated higher levels of identity demonstrated greater science interest and consumption verses those demonstrating moderate and low levels of identity. Six selected case studies are presented; two for each level and one each from both majors and non-majors science courses. The majority of the participants who demonstrated the highest levels of science identity had a mentor (i.e., a person with whom the participant engaged in science or science-adjacent recognition work). These high level science identity cases also demonstrated an overt desire to be recognized as scientifically savvy through their discussions. The outcomes of this research indicate these participants see themselves as engaging in science primarily during ""free-choice"" science activities such as cooking and sports, rather than through more formal, structured places and events (e.g., museums, aquaria). These ""free-choice"" activities are portrayed as personally relevant and suggest that participants identify themselves as being interested or proficient in these activities. The relevance and interest that participants identify with these activities suggest these are promising avenues ...

Ss in the experimental group were taught with cognitive match strategy to evoke their learning interest and satisfy their curiosity (Exp 1) or with formal match strategy (Exp 2) through free speech, creative involvement, role play, subject discussion while Ss in control group were taught in a traditional way. Before and after the classes, Ss in both groups were given a cognitive test (knowledge) and an affective test (attention, active thinking, learning interest, affection, and emotion). The results indicate that the application of the cognitive match and formal match strategy to handling teaching material could regulate students' learning sets and promote students' cognitive and affective learning, and improve classroom teaching quality.

2399,"Curiosity and pathways to well-being and meaning in life: Traits, states, and everyday behaviors","This study examined curiosity as a mechanism for achieving and maintaining high levels of well-being and meaning in life. Of primary interest was whether people high in trait curiosity derive greater well-being on days when they are more curious. We also tested whether trait and daily curiosity led to greater, sustainable well-being. Predictions were tested using trait measures and 21 daily diary reports from 97 college students. We found that on days when they are more curious, people high in trait curiosity reported more frequent growth-oriented behaviors, and greater presence of meaning, search for meaning, and life satisfaction. Greater trait curiosity and greater curiosity on a given day also predicted greater persistence of meaning in life from one day into the next. People with greater trait curiosity reported more frequent hedonistic events but they were associated with less pleasure compared to the experiences of people with less trait curiosity. The benefits of hedonistic events did not last beyond the day of their occurrence. As evidence of construct specificity, curiosity effects were not attributable to Big Five personality traits or daily positive or negative mood. Our results provide support for curiosity as an ingredient in the development of well-being and meaning in life. The pattern of findings casts doubt on some distinctions drawn between eudaimonia and hedonic well-being traditions.","Kashdan, Todd B and Steger, Michael F",0,10.1007/s11031-007-9068-7,1705

2401,The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia: The third Wang Tieya lecture,"International criminal justice is a relatively new field of international law. For this reason alone, it excites curiosity. Minute traces of the new development are to be found in the years preceding the Treaty of Versailles. The provisions of that treaty relating to the subject were less than credibly performed. The International Military Tribunal caught the attention of jurists for a while, but thereafter the matter went in practice into a 50-year somnolence until re-awakened in 1993 by the establishment of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The reason why an interest has to be taken in the subject exceeds the novelty of the field: it has to do with substance. The traditional immunity of presidents or heads of government, prime ministers and other functionaries acting in an official capacity no longer prevails; the doctrine of superior orders is inapplicable except, where appropriate, as in mitigation; and the gap between international armed conflict and internal armed conflict has closed. More generally, the bridge has been crossed between the responsibility of the State and the criminal liability of the individual. As a result, the traditional impunity of actors for the State has practically gone. Judge Wang Tieya helped in this process and merits grateful thanks. <c2><a9> The Author 2012.

2408,The effectiveness of a popular science promotion program on nanotechnology for elementary school students in I-Lan City,"Background:Nanotechnology education has become an urgent priority to nurture skilled human resources for the rapidly developing nanotechnology-related industries. The promotion of popular science education focusing on nanotechnology is an ideal approach to bridge the gaps in formal curricula, and to stimulate curiosity about and interest in nanotechnology among schoolchildren.Purpose:The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Nanotechnology-based Popular Science Education Promotion and Teaching (NPSEPT) program through camp activity that was implemented in elementary schools in I-Lan City, Taiwan.Program description:To create a competitive advantage, a human resources development program was implemented as one of the nanotechnology incubation projects in Taiwan and focused on developing an appropriately-skilled professional workforce as well as promoting popular science education.Sample:The volunteer research participants were 323 sixth grade students in four elementary schools in I-Lan City, Taiwan, who were evaluated at the beginning and the end of the nanotechnology-based popular science promotion camp activity.Design and methods:A research tool called the NPSEPT test' was designed specifically for this study and was approved by experts who evaluated its content and face validity. The questionnaire was divided into three aspects: Nanophenomena in the natural world'; Nanomaterials and their scaling effects'; and Definition, characteristics, and applications of nanotechnology.' The effectiveness of learning among the students was analyzed using descriptive statistics, a paired sample t-test, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a post hoc comparison.Results:The results of the three-part NPSEPT test' revealed that NPSEPT significantly advanced nanotechnology learning performance and outcomes among students in the four participating elementary schools. Of the 15 questions included in the NPSEPT test, positive change for more than 30% of students was achieved for eight questions related to nanotechnology concepts.Conclusions:Significant effectiveness of the NPSEPT program and nanotechnology learning outcomes of the elementary school students were observed. The NPSEPT program should therefore be considered an appropriate program to promote popular science with a focus on nanotechnology in elementary schools.","Lin, Show-Yu and Wu, Ming-Ta and Cho, Ya-I and Chen, Hui-Huang",0,10.1080/02635143.2014.971733,1711

Playtesting with 45 children ages 8 to 12 has revealed how TuneTrain arouses curiosity and inspires through rewarding moments of self-directed creation.","Lee, Jiyoung and Gea, Albert and Levin, Nathan and Yang, Cheng and Deciron, Romain and Lee, Michael and Lu, Pei-Lin and Xie, Meng",0,,1712
2411,The life and career of Paul MacLean: A journey toward neurobiological and social harmony,"Working as a physician, Paul MacLean's interests moved in the direction of the brain when he realized that most of his patients suffered from symptoms (e.g. anxiety, sleeping problems) that could not be traced to a known physiological cause. His curiosity about the neurological origins of these psychological symptoms led him to the laboratories of Stanley Cobb and James Papez, both of whom were influential in guiding MacLean's interests toward the temporal lobe. His neurobiological interest was not contained, however, to the temporal lobe. As his own family grew to include a wife and five children, his scholarly pursuits extended to social and familial relations and their accompanying underlying neuroanatomical circuits (i.e. the thalamocingulate system). Viewing the brain and behavior from an evolutionary perspective, MacLean introduced the concept of the ``triune brain'' to describe the evolutionarily distinct components of the mammalian brain and reintroduced Broca's term ``limbic'' to describe a neuroanatomical system involved in emotional functions. MacLean wrote that the development of social behaviors, such as mother-infant audiovocal communication and the separation cry of the offspring, served as the driving force in the evolution of the neocortex. MacLean's neuroevolutionary perspective and appreciation of the complexity and evolutionary significance of social systems offer valuable insights into the contemporary fields of behavioral neuroscience and biological psychiatry.

This includes breaking open all letters that are brought to us in front of any company. The vice opposite curiosity is negligence, or indifference; and the reading of letters ought not to be deferred, as this may lead to the loss of vital information. Saying ""tomorrow is another day,"" may lead to death and destruction. A wise man may, for the sake of another person, either for fear of indecently disturbing the company, or of breaking off another affair of importance, put off the reading or hearing any new thing that is brought to him; but if a man, for his own particular interest or pleasure, even though he holds a public office, will not interrupt his dinner, or be awaked out of his nap, he is inexcusable.

The principles of the constant comparative method of data analysis were used to analyze the individual interviews. Results indicated that in addition to their Spanish language proficiency, the participants shared an interest in traveling and learning about other cultures. These factors coupled with the need for Spanish-speaking providers and the support received from colleagues and employers fostered their development as bilingual therapists. Having received little or no training to provide services to Spanish-speaking clients, they acquired their therapeutic skills by receiving feedback from their clients and by practicing. Speaking Spanish as their second language presented some unique linguistic challenges. Clients expressed surprise and asked questions when they discovered their therapists spoke Spanish. Showing respect, humbleness, curiosity, and interest in their life experiences and background helped the participants build strong working relationships with their clients. The participants discovered that revealing more about themselves relieved their clients' early doubts. Moreover, having a strong interest in working with this population and sharing Latina/o cultural values strengthened the connections with Latina/o clients.","Verdinelli, Susana and Biever, Joan L",0,10.1037/lat0000004,1716

The increasing scale of water contamination owing to the presence of nitrate and nitrite in the environment has converted it into one of the most serious public health problems in modern society. Here an easy colorimetric method for determining nitrite in water is reported. The method is based on the reaction of nitrite with minoxidil in acidic media, which gives nitrosominoxidil as a product that shows an absorption band in the <ce><bb> = 315-330 nm range. Minoxidil was the first drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a treatment against alopecia (hair loss), thus leading minoxidil to be one of the most popular and commonly used drugs that can be purchased freely at low cost on the market in the form of topical solutions. The experiment can be completed over 3.5 h, and it can be extended to include a kinetic mechanistic study of the nitrosation reaction. The nitrite detection range makes the method suitable for environmental, food, and physiological analytical applications.

2421,Examining the Relationship between Epistemic Curiosity and Achievement Goals,"Problem statement: Although the prominent role of epistemic curiosity in students' achievement goals has long been emphasized in educational research, there is only one study in which the relationship between epistemic curiosity and achievement goals were empirically investigated. However, given the well-evidenced educational importance of both achievement goals and epistemic curiosity, it can be said that it is important to examine the relationship between them in order to explore the epistemic roots of students' achievement goals in settings, such as universities, which are achievement based. Thus, the present study has examined the relationship between epistemic curiosity and achievement goals. Purpose of study: The aim of this study is twofold. First, it is to examine the relationship between students' achievement goals and epistemic curiosity; and second, it is to examine the role of epistemic curiosity as the predictor of students' achievement goals. Method: Based on the survey method, a total of 309 undergraduate students voluntarily participated in the study. The Epistemic Curiosity Scale was used to assess students' curiosity as feeling of interest whereas the Curiosity as Feeling of Deprivation Scale was used to assess students' feelings of uncertainty and tension that motivated students' information-seeking and problem-solving behavior. Students' achievement goals, however, were assessed by the Achievement Goal Questionnaire. One-sample t tests, correlation, and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to answer the research questions. Findings and Results: The descriptive results of the study showed that both students' curiosity as a feeling of deprivation and as a feeling of interest were at relatively high levels. Students also tended to adopt both a performance-approach and a mastery goal over performance-avoidance goals. Contrary to the expectations, the results of the hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that not curiosity as a feeling of interest, but curiosity as a feeling of deprivation significantly predicted students' achievement goal orientations. Conclusions and Recommendations: The present study revealed that students' epistemic curiosity, especially in the curiosity as a feeling of deprivation form, significantly correlated with students' mastery goals and performance-approach goals. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the epistemic nature of students' curiosity, especially in the curiosity as a feeling of deprivation form, should be considered both in educational settings and future research.","Eren, Altay",0,,1719

2424,A Culture of its own: Taking Latin America seriously,"A Culture of Its Own: Taking Latin America Seriously presents Mark Falcoff's essays on the region. Many of them are contentious; none of them are dull. He ranges from bilingualism to the cult of Garcia Lorca, from U.S.-Cuban relations to Chile's curious love affair with Germany. On more than one occasion, Falcoff takes aim at American journalism and scholarship, both of which, he argues, have all too often produced a fantasy version of Latin America which reflects our own national narcissism rather than genuine curiosity about the other. Latin America, Falcoff argues, is not merely a geographical extension of the United States, or a kind of downmarket version of the American Southwest. It is a culture all its own, with its own historical memory, sensibility, and worldview.

2425,Interest and Interests: The Psychology of Constructive Capriciousness,"This article develops a perspective on interest and interests as aspects of motivation, emotion, and personality. Interest is viewed as a capricious emotion with few, if any, immediate adaptational functions; it serves long-term adaptational goals by cultivating knowledge and diversifying skills and experience. Interests are viewed as idiosyncratic intrinsic motives that promote expertise. Theories of how interests arise are reviewed and organized. A model of how the emotion of interest participates in the development of enduring interests is proposed. The author concludes that apparently frivolous aspects of motivation and personality such as ""idle curiosity"" and avocations seem to play complex roles in human experience and development.","Silvia, P J",0,10.1037/1089-2680.5.3.270,1723

2431,Training to think culturally: A multidimensional comparative framework,"Describes a multidimensional comparative framework (MCF) for the inclusion of cultural concerns in family therapy (FT) training. Implied conceptual approaches are social constructionist and multicultural or cultural diversity. Family therapists are said to have taken universalist, particularist, ethnic-focused, or multidimensional positions. The rationale for a MCF is based on the assumption that in a multicultural society, each person is raised in several cultural subgroups and draws selectively from the groups' relative influences. Concepts addressed include cultural borderlands and ecological niches. Training objectives include taking culture in the mainstream of FT and generating an attitude of interest, sociological imagination, and respectful curiosity about culture. Key comparative parameters are the ecological context, migration and acculturation, family organization, and family life cycle.

This question is too broad: there are many kinds of money, interest, and people.

Curiosity and the quest for power, however, qualify too. As L&W rightly admit, other approaches supplement their biological one.","Ainslie, G",0,10.1017/S0140525X06239049,1726
2433,The five-dimensional curiosity scale: Capturing the bandwidth of curiosity and identifying four unique subgroups of curious people,"Since the origins of psychology, curiosity has occupied a pivotal position in the study of motivation, emotion, and cognition; and disciplines as far-ranging as biology, economics, robotics, and leadership. Theorists have disagreed about the basic tenets of curiosity; some researchers contend that the rewards arise when resolving ambiguity and uncertainty whereas others argue that being curious is an intrinsically pleasurable experience. Three studies were conducted to consolidate competing theories and isolated bodies of research. Using data from a community survey of 508 adults (Study 1), 403 adults on MTurk (Study 2), and a nationally representative household survey of 3,000 adults (Study 3), we found evidence for five distinct factors: Joyous Exploration, Deprivation Sensitivity, Stress Tolerance, Social Curiosity, and Thrill Seeking - forming The Five-Dimensional Curiosity Scale (5DC). Each factor had substantive relations with a battery of personality, emotion, and well-being measures. Taking advantage of this multidimensional model, we found evidence for four distinct types of curious people in Study 3 referred to as The Fascinated (28% of sample), Problem Solvers (28%), Empathizers (25%), and Avoiders (19%). Subgroups differed in their passionate interests, areas of expertise, consumer behavior, and social media use; challenging an assumption that there is a homogenous population to be discriminated on a single dimension from incurious to very curious. With greater bandwidth and predictive power, the 5DC offers new opportunities for research on origins, consequences, life outcomes, and intervention strategies to enhance curiosity.","Kashdan, Todd B. and Stiksma, Melissa C. and Disabato, David J. and McKnight, Patrick E. and Bekier, John and Kaji, Joel and Lazarus, Rachel",0,10.1016/j.jrp.2017.11.011,1727

2437,"William beckford: Travel writer, travel reader","William Beckford (1760-1844) is known chiefly as a collector, bibliophile, Orientalist, and author of the Gothic novel Vathek. In his early life, he was also an inveterate traveller, and the published and unpublished writing he produced on the basis of his travels vastly outweighed his fictional output, but has received surprisingly little critical attention by comparison. Travel books were a prominent part of Beckford's nationally celebrated library, and, as was his habit with books of all kinds, he made careful notes on his reading, extracting interesting passages and occasionally inserting framing remarks or observations of his own. This article briefly reviews Beckford's career as a traveller and travel writer as context for a study of his practices and preferences as a travel reader, using as its raw material, compilations of his reading notes, and books formerly owned by Beckford (with manuscript notes intact), held by the Bodleian Library. Whereas Beckford's travel writing displays in abundance those qualities of interiority and imaginative freedom long synonymous with the idea of romantic travel, as a travel reader he shows a keen interest in the empirical content of books, with a particular eye for landscape descriptions, natural history, and anthropological curiosities. At the same time, he is capable of talking directly and animatedly to books or their authors, and is occasionally provoked into commenting on social or political matters. The article is a case study on the history of reading, with a rare focus on the popular romantic genre of travel literature. <c2><a9> The Author 2013.","Jarvis, R",0,10.1093/res/hgt039,1730
2438,"I Know What I'm Doing, I Just Don't Know What to Call It","Three concepts critically important in developing curricula for young children are play, thinking/creativity, and sustained interest. Through play, children explore the world; practice discovered relationships; and establish meanings for concepts, words, ideas, and actions. Teachers should actively focus on the learning potential of play. Teachers' concepts of children's cognitive and creative development should also be broad enough to include a range of thinking activity levels and at least four basic dimensions of creativity. Specifically with respect to thinking, children are capable of knowledge acquisition/processing, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. Ideational fluency, originality, flexibility, and elaborate thinking are dimensions of creativity that teachers can also increase, while they remain sensitive to differences in children's learning styles. A good curriculum is responsive to children's curiosity, develops and furthers their interest commitments, and introduces new areas of interest. These three important aspects of curricula for young children can be integrated in practice through the use of ""webbing"" and a project approach. Webbing, a process designed to organize children's brainstorming efforts, results in an integrated written record of the knowledge, processes, resources, and learning experiences/products associated with a given topic and provides a detailed basis for project development.

Data were collected through surveys, observations, interviews, and cumulative academic files. The most frequently reported reasons for enrolling in algebra were for acceleration of course-taking and preparation for high school. Males demonstrated a higher level of self-efficacy to perform in algebra and secondary mathematics. Students showed a high level of perseverance in terms of sacrifices made to take the course, but classroom performances indicated negative dispositions toward mathematics. Students were driven by a desire to please the teacher and earn grades rather than out of natural curiosity and interest. Neither students nor their parents recognized the real-world applications of algebra. Certain teaching methodologies appeared to evoke positive dispositions. Contains 17 references.

The baby is nursed whenever it cries, weaning occurs late, and toilet training is not begun until the infant can understand verbal commands. The child is subjected to very few prohibitions; he is not punished for manipulative curiosity; he eats and sleeps when he wishes; and he has ample time for free play.

2442,Does an Open-Ended Design Project increase Creativity in Engineering Students?,"Many schools are incorporating project-based interdisciplinary exercises into their engineering curriculum in order to develop the qualitative and quantitative skills simultaneously. It has been shown that introducing design in a freshman engineering course has a positive impact on retention, stimulates interest in engineering and enhances communication, teaming and time management skills. But can design also improve creativity? Or, to be more specific, would an open-ended design project improve creativity in engineering students? In the fall of 2015, an innovative design project was used in a first-year engineering course at Michigan Technological University. Students were given the task to develop a prototype of a new product or an improvement on an existing product. While some of the tasks were defined throughout the semester, the product they created was completely up to the team. It was thought that the open-ended nature of the project and the product itself being new or innovative would help improve their creativity. Students completing this project were given a 55 question pre- and post-assessment. This assessment included several measures of general creativity and entrepreneurial intentions: Oreg's Resistance to Change Scale (RTC), the Curiosity and Exploration Inventory (CEI), and the Zampetakis & Moustakis Scale (Z & M Scale). This paper focuses on the development and evaluation of this open-ended design project for first-year engineering students and the results of the various measures of creativity.","Kemppainen, Amber and Hein, Gretchen and Manser, Nathan",0,,1734

2445,THE WIN-WIN INTERACTION BETWEEN THE 1ST GRADE TEACHER AND THE JUNIOR,"Scientific thinking can be characterized in terms of two principal features: i) contents and ii) processes, including formulation of hypotheses, design of experiments, observation, and evaluation of evidence [1]. Swartz [2] argues that, to be successful, the process of learning has to take into account, not only the development of critical thinking, but also the development of other competencies. More recently it was stated that innovative methods contribute to develop interest and motivation to learn about science and scientific procedures [3, 4]. In this work we would like to write about an educational research named Junior Science Project [5, 6] we are designing, developing and implementing with 6 years old children aiming to work and extend key competencies such as attention and concentration in order to prepare students for the scientific thinking requirements. In all western cultures nowadays children participate in a numerous changing situations and have a multitude of different stimulus, a big part of those challenges are virtual. These children are the first generation born and raised in the virtual era. These kids grow up without the explicit notion of privacy and having added difficulties in concentrating on challenges located on the real world. On the other hand they can focus intensely and for long periods of times in the virtual world.

2446,Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges: Do they represent an ictal pattern requiring treatment?,"The goal of this report is to review periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs), particularly their associated symptoms, the possibility that the pattern represents a focal status epilepticus, and finally the usefulness of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The associated symptoms often include an ``altered state of consciousness'' or ``confusional state,'' but also more specific symptoms have been noted, such as nystagmus retractorius, cortical blindness, depression, apraxia, amnesia, hemianopsia, hemiparesis, gaze preference or deviation, dysphasia, and speech impediment. PLEDs have often been referred to as an ictal pattern, and many investigators have viewed the condition an example of subclinical status epilepticus. The intense hypermetabolism and increased blood flow revealed by PET and SPECT scans have been considered to support the ictal nature of this waveform. Although the pattern is difficult to treat, the AEDs that have been reported as successful include carbamazepine, midazolam, pentobarbital, sodium valproate, and felbamate.

2447,Creativity Through the Life Span From an Evolutionary Systems Perspective,"The authors define and illustrate the manifestations of creativity. They show that both genes and memes inform development. They link creativity with play but dispel the notion that creative play and fresh views are confined to the early years of life. Finding examples in older creators, they show that creativity need not decay until life's very end. Linking learning with creativity in later life, the authors distinguish between seniors' difficulties in learning new tools and the ease with which many elders continue to engage in creative ideas and ongoing learning. Personal satisfaction and one's use of resources are integral to the process. The authors distinguish between physical and social aging and, pointing to the ways new ideas emerge and are adopted, invoke Kuhn's (1962) thought on how conventional thinking opposes groundbreaking ideas. Vignettes of elders who continue to create and learn fill the chapter, inspiring a view of later life as that which is not necessarily conservative, passive, and passionless. They show us how creative persons preserve and make use of their curiosity, their interest in ongoing learning, their ""maverick"" tendencies, and their aesthetic experiences. They conclude the chapter with practical suggestions regarding the ways adult creativity can be developed, supported, and enriched.

2448,Examining Millie and Christine McKoy: Where enslavement and enfreakment meet: Winner of the 2011 catharine stimpson prize for outstanding feminist scholarship,"Millie and Christine McKoy were African American conjoined twins born into slavery in North Carolina in 1851. Physically joined at the pelvis, they were objects of curiosity, inspection, and invasion from the moment of their birth. Medical and lay interest in their unique pelvic anatomy can be understood within the larger contexts of the nineteenth-century freak show, the pathologization of black female sexuality, and the complex dynamics of American enslavement and emancipation. This article calls for a revisionary understanding of the McKoys that reveals imperatives of agency and triumphs of subjectivity largely overlooked or misunderstood by historians to date. By examining two key representations of the McKoy sisters in light of newly discovered historical evidence, I seek not only to enrich our understanding of their remarkable lives but also to signally expand current conversations within disability, feminist, and African American studies regarding individuals who possess what Rosemarie Garland Thomson has termed ""extraordinary bodies.""

At Cambridge where I was studying pre-clinical medicine in 1943 a friend gave me a book, Woodworth's Schools of Psychotherapy. After reading about psychoanalysis my interest and curiosity was highly stimulated. I began analysis with Dr Adrian Stephen, the younger brother of Virginia Woolf in Upper Harley Street and as I was then a student at University College Hospital which was within walking or running distance I began my analysis there. When I started psychiatry it was before the era of modern psychopharmacology. When I qualified as a psychoanalyst towards the end of the 1950s the ""scientific life"" of the Institute consisted of meetings on Wednesday evenings when psychoanalytic cases and theories were presented. I presided over that section for several years and was able to bring in distinguished biologists and intellectuals including George Steiner and ethologists. The second that I take pride in is when I was appointed Chair of the Publications Committee, a prestigious post which oversaw the publication of the International Journal of Psychoanalysis and the International Library of Psychoanalysis, I pushed for the critical examination of the Strachey translation of Freud's collected papers. I ran seminars for several years on American contributions to psychoanalysis. I have been asked to speak about my own life within Group Analysis and I hope that in doing so I have cast some light on its history.

Consistent with expectations, the results of confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the C/IW, CEL PC, EC scales defined an Interest (I) curiosity factor, whereas the CFD scales formed a Deprivation (D) curiosity factor. However, as compared to the other interest-based curiosity measures, one of the EC subscales was found to be less differentiated from the CFD scales, presumably because these instruments assess overlapping aspects of Berlyne's (1954) concept of epistemic curiosity. The results of this study indicated that I and D curiosity are related but differentiated curiosity dimensions, providing evidence for the validity of the I/D model.","Litman, Jordan A and Silvia, Paul J",0,10.1207/s15327752jpa8603_07,1746

Effective classroom teachers possess a deep understanding of the developmental characteristics of their students and are adept at translating this understanding into opportunities for individual students to demonstrate their understanding. An effective teacher creates a student-centered learning experience that explicitly links essential concepts and skills to student's current understanding and natural curiosity about the topic. High-quality teachers provide opportunities for students to make choices, to be creative, and to practice and enhance critical-thinking skills, all while holding student interest. Another critical component of high-energy learning environments are creative assessments that stretch student thinking. This article illustrates how the careful structuring of learning experiences within a unit can lead to authentic, student-centered assessment. While the examples provided in this article are from a fifth-grade science lesson, the ideas are applicable to all disciplines and grade levels. Techniques for rich, authentic asssessment are revealed through a polymer gel spheres project. The process followed in developing and carrying out the authentic assessment task featured in this article is not restricted to the chemistry unit described here. This process can be used at other grade levels and within other disciplines.","Stone, Jody H and Lockhart, Amy",0,,1748
2462,The psychology of interest (II),"Establishes the relation between interest and feeling, and between interest and attention, and the nature of interest (see PA Vol 13:51399). Interest is distinct from, but closely connected to feelings of pleasure and pain, as well as attention. The meaning or felt worth of an object is the consciousness of the attitude aroused by such an object. There is a tendency serially to realize reactions which will arise when a future condition is reached and to which the present situation is a means. This tendency is felt as interest. However, unless some cognitive element is present no future reference is possible and no interest can exist. Interest is, therefore, a body attitude pointing to the future. The relation of interest to expectation, desire, curiosity, and the like are discussed. Interest has also been related to apperception. Interest is not merely a physiological sensation, it is a manner of interpretation and reaction.

The volume is separated into 11 parts beginning with the ""Major developments in positive psychology"" which highlights inventions and discussions that reveal the potency of human strengths and positive emotions and highlights the new role of positive psychology practice. In ""Positive psychology perspectives on human behavior,"" the chapters highlight the need for shifting our sole focus from weakness to an understanding of human behavior that includes a deep knowledge of strengths. ""Positive psychology across the life span,"" the third part, expands what was previously known about positive human development. The next five parts of the book summarize the research on positive psychology constructs and processes, ranging from subjective well-being to the biologically based toughness. A new section of the volume, ""Positive institutions,"" discusses the role of good environments on positive behavior. ""Specific coping approaches"" and ""Toward better lives"" highlight the pathways and strategies that can turn a good life into a great one. We purposefully end the volume with a discussion of happiness and meaning, two of the most desirable outcomes associated with positive psychology work.

2467,INFINITY OF NUMBERS: HOW STUDENTS UNDERSTAND IT,"Some results of the research project `Development of Understanding and Self-confidence in Mathematics', implemented at the University of Turku (Finland) during the academic years 2001-03, are reported. The project was funded by the Academy of Finland (project #51019). It was a two-year study for grades 5-6 and 7-8. The study included a quantitative survey for approximately 150 Finnish mathematics classes out of which 10 classes were selected to a longitudinal part of the study. This paper is based on the survey results, and will focus on students' understanding of infinity and the development of that understanding. The results show that most of the students did not have a proper view of infinity but that the share of able students grew, as the students got older. Most primary children are very interested in infinity, and they enjoy discussing the concept, if the teacher is only ready for it. On one hand they have a concrete view on the world around and mathematics, and on the other hand they are ready to play with numbers. Thus, questions on infinity may also come into light. Infinity awakes curiosity in children already before they enter school: ``preschool and young elementary school children show intuitions of infinity'' (Wheeler, 1987). However, this early interest is not often met by school mathematics curriculum, and infinity remains mysterious for most students throughout school years.","Pehkonen, Erkki and Hannula, Markku S and Maijala, Hanna and Soro, Riitta",0,,1751
2468,The First Years Out. Occasional Paper Series 13,"The essays presented in this ""Occasional Paper"" reflect the voices of those in the midst of becoming the teachers they hope to be. In these essays, teachers find courage, resourcefulness, insight, and inspiration. They are reminded not to give up on themselves. Three vital aspects explored in these essays include: (1) teaching is about being present to what or who is before oneself--This requires the development of curiosity, an interest in the students' experience; (2) teaching is about bringing one's whole self--one's heart, mind, and ethics--to the classroom--Teaching happens both through who one is and what one does; and (3) teaching is about generosity--Teachers demonstrate this in their willingness to share whatever they have learned from their own journeys, to tell their stories as a way of keeping everyone else afloat. Following an introduction by Judith Leipzig, essays in this ""Occasional Paper"" include: (1) When September Comes Again (Elizabeth Huffman); (2) Starting Over Again: Comparing the First and Second Years of Teaching (Scott Moran); (3) Wrong Place, Right Time (Rachel Mazor); (4) Learning to Keep My Heart Open (Marika Paez); and (5) Normalizing the Need for Help (Nancy Gropper).","Leipzig, Judith and Silin, Jonathan G and Bank Street Coll. of Education  NY., New York",0,,1752

2470,Gaze Transition Entropy,"This article details a two-step method of quantifying eye movement transitions between areas of interest (AOIs). First, individuals' gaze switching patterns, represented by fixated AOI sequences, are modeled as Markov chains. Second, Shannon's entropy coefficient of the fit Markov model is computed to quantify the complexity of individual switching patterns. To determine the overall distribution of attention over AOIs, the entropy coefficient of individuals' stationary distribution of fixations is calculated. The novelty of the method is that it captures the variability of individual differences in eye movement characteristics, which are then summarized statistically. The method is demonstrated on gaze data collected from two studies, during free viewing of classical art paintings. Normalized Shannon's entropy, derived from individual transition matrices, is related to participants' individual differences as well as to either their aesthetic impression or recognition of artwork. Low transition and high stationary entropies suggest greater curiosity mixed with a higher subjective aesthetic affinity toward artwork, possibly indicative of visual scanning of the artwork in a more deliberate way. Meanwhile, both high transition and stationary entropies may be indicative of recognition of familiar artwork.","Krejtz, Krzysztof and Duchowski, Andrew and Szmidt, Tomasz and Krejtz, Izabela and Perillj, Fernando Gonzalez and Fires, Ana and Vilaro Anna and and Villalobos, Natalia",0,10.1145/2834121,1754
2472,AC 2012-5341: IMPROVING STUDENT ENGAGEMENT: AN APPROACH USED IN,"Instructors frequently ask themselves ``What are the best ways for an instructor to support student learning? How can we assist students in engaging in deep learning? How can we help them bridge the divide between theory and practice? This paper discusses efforts to address these issues in a course on Kinematics and Dynamics of Machinery. Kinematics and Dynamics of Machinery is a core course in the mechanical engineering curriculum. One of the challenges in this course is to make students fully appreciate mechanism design by integrating the principles of kinematics and dynamics in real world design practice. To assist with this goal, students were encouraged, early in the term, to discover real life examples of mechanisms with an aim to promote curiosity and foster interest in learning. Throughout the term, a design project was introduced which required students not only to apply fundamentals of kinematics and dynamics, but also to exercise skills in teamwork, collaborative learning and communication. A student survey was conducted at the end of the course and the efficacy of the approach was assessed.","Yan, Claire Yu and Labun, Carolyn",0,,1755
2473,Applying the Flipped Classroom with Game-Based Learning in Elementary School Students' English Learning,"Game-based learning can not only lead to learning through the virtual game world but also trigger learner motives via planned gaming processes. Supplemented game-based learning activities not only allow learners to practice repeatedly but also entail them to reach learning objectives. This study aimed to utilize flipped classroom with digital game-based learning activities in elementary school students' English learning. The study investigated the effects of English learning, and the motivation of the experimental group in attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. Results indicate that there were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups. However, the experimental group did show large improvement in learning achievements after game-based flipped learning activities. By looking at the conscious reaction of experimental group toward the flipped classroom with game-based learning, in addition, the research found that participants believed the method could trigger their interest and curiosity in learning, and that the games prepared them for successive learning materials. Moreover, results also show that the game-based learning process could promote their sense of accomplishment in learning, thus encouraging them to continue learning. <c2><a9> 2016 IEEE.","Tao, S.-Y. and Huang, Y.-H. and Tsai, M.-J.",1,10.1109/EITT.2016.19,1756
2474,Trends and future directions,"As artificial neural networks (ANNs) become more widely accepted in organizational research, they have the potential to influence how research questions are framed, how theory is developed, and how research findings are interpreted and applied. At present, interest in neural networks is comparatively low among social scientists, but there is a noticeable curiosity about ANNs among a small but growing group of scientists conducting both theoretical and applied organizational research. This chapter is intended to provide some notion of how ANNs might influence theoretical and applied behavioral research in organizations. We begin with a discussion of how neural networks are likely to affect the research process. Then we identify several areas in which more research is needed on neural networks applied to behavioral data in organizations. Finally, we suggest potential applications of neural modeling beyond those described in this book.

2475,Where Self-Awareness Isn't,"Reviews the book, Self-Awareness Deficits in Psychiatric Patients: Neurobiology, Assessment, and Treatment edited by Bernard D. Beitman and Jyotsna Nair (see record 2005-01876-000). Mental health professionals and laypeople alike have long been fascinated by distortions of self-awareness, such as people who believe they are God or Napoleon, think they have extraordinary powers, have the sensation that their amputated arm is still present, are not aware that they cannot move their left side or recognize their own left arm, fail to recognize that alcohol has devastated their life, or become paralyzed for no medical reason. Aside from morbid or prurient curiosity, however, these varied conditions are interesting because they hold the promise of insight into the human condition and, in particular, into the nature of self-awareness and the function of the brain. The editors of Self-Awareness Deficits in Psychiatric Patients: Neurobiology, Assessment, and Treatment, Bernard D. Beitman and Jyotsna Nair, are to be commended for their efforts to draw together between two covers work on the common theme of disorders of self-awareness. Part 1, Toward a Neurobiology of Self-Awareness, provides the overview and rationale for the volume. Part 2, Self-Awareness in Psychiatric Patients, addresses the populations of schizophrenia, autism, alcoholism, borderline personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, stroke, and conversion disorder. Overall, this review of psychiatric disorders provides an opportunity for the authors to recast common disorders in the light of self-awareness deficits and the difficulties these present for assessment and treatment. Overall, this book targets psychiatrists rather than the general reader. A predominantly psychiatric worldview is evident in the presuppositions of medical knowledge; the priorities for evaluation and treatment; the omniscient perspective; the choice of populations to feature; and the preferred, largely clinical methods of investigation. The book will be of interest to clinicians, and psychiatrists in particular, with advanced knowledge of neurobiology who would like to gain further understanding about the neurobiological etiology of disordered self-awareness or who would like to gain a greater appreciation for the psychological and social implications for such a disorder. Other informed readers may glean material of interest but may also feel like unexpected guests in this house. The current book represents an additional step toward understanding the neurobiological and developmental etiology of self-awareness disorders, although a truly integrative volume on this topic remains to be written.

2476,Physician's curiosity: Myriad benefits in the clinical encounter and beyond,"Curiosity, that quintessential characteristic of childhood and learning, shows attrition with time and adults often demonstrate considerably less curiosity than before. This attrition may be particularly deleterious when health care providers are affected. The clinical encounter between patient and physician in today's test-saturated and technology-driven medical practice has been often criticized for common superficial history-taking; cursory physical examination; inattention to the patient as a person and to the patient's emotional cues and contextual factors; and lack of an all-important patient-centered attitude. In addition to patients' disappointment with the 'experience of care' and quantifiable problems with the quality of care provided, physicians are frequently found to suffer from fatigue, burnout and depression strongly affecting their quality of life as well as compromising the quality of care they are able to provide. All of these deficiencies could be avoided and corrected by adopting Curiosity as an overriding physician attribute in each encounter. Curiosity is an attitude that can be utilized in a time-frugal manner and its adoption infuses every encounter with freshness and enthusiasm. Thus, physician's adoption of curiosity in the encounter will yield significant advantages in both the cognitive and the emotive domains of the encounter to the mutual benefit of the physician and the patient. On the cognitive side, Curiosity will translate into better quality of communication and elicitation of the patient's history, concerns and signs, and frequent search for patient-tailored evidence. Improved decision-making is likely, in addition to the benefits of seeing each encounter as a learning (and possibly research) opportunity. On the emotive side, the physician's interest will soon translate to knowing and acknowledging the patient and correctly identifying common emotional and contextual problems that need attention. Increasing empathy and commitment naturally follow. Thus, curiosity begets emotional engagement and greater therapeutic efficacy. Considering the myriad advantages of Curiosity in Medicine, its meager place in medical education is highly surprising. Curiosity should be evaluated and incorporated in the selection of candidates to our medical schools, as well as nurtured throughout graduate and postgraduate medical education programs. Concurrently, research on methods to quantitate curiosity and enhance it should be strongly encouraged (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)","Schattner, Ami",0,,1759

2478,Attraction theory,"Purpose To explain how the components of attraction theory work in unison to prompt students to take an initial stimulus and progress through critical thinking processes and into knowledge acquisition, organization, and synthesis. Design/methodology/approach Although schema theory has an important role in understanding knowledge acquisition, it does not pro-vide directives for how to plan instruction so students can build their understandings and comprehension of subject matter. This chapter out-lines a pedagogical approach to the implementation of a new theory of learning that builds on cognitive science, affect, and interest. Findings Students can become re-attracted to learning through effective teaching inclusive of a jolt, curiosity, retrieving explanations, counterexamples, clarifications, and embedding that information within schemata. Practical implications Proactive investigations and continued research on attraction theory can enrich our understanding of teaching and learning, provide answers for what works in the classroom, and equip us with tools from which to select for unique classroom circumstances. <c2><a9> 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.",,0,,1761
2479,Foreword,"The idea of this book originated in a conversation I had several years ago at a Bilderberg meeting in Scotland with Margaret MacMillan, Professor of History at the University of Toronto. Margaret, a great scholar of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, was keenly aware of the role played by Eleftherios Venizelos in the meetings that redrew the political map of Europe and expressed an interest in reading more about him and his policies. I promised to send her books in English to satisfy her curiosity, which I understood had also to do with the close personal friendship between Venizelos and her great grandfather David Lloyd George. When I returned to Greece I called a close friend, Paschalis Kitromilides, Professor of Political Science at the University of Athens and asked him to suggest some works on Venizelos in English. He chuckled on the phone and told me that the latest book in English on Venizelos had been published by our Cypriot compatriot Doros Alastos as far back as 1942. I was both slightly shocked and amused by the revelation. This gave me the idea that under the aegis of the A. G. Leventis Foundation a new book presenting a profile of Venizelos as leader, statesman and reformer of Greek society could be published. For this undertaking I thought there was no one better than Professor Kitromilides himself, a well-established and respected authority on modern Greek history and politics. I therefore asked him to organise the project in his capacity as Director of the Institute for Neohellenic Research at the National Hellenic Research Foundation. The present book is the result of his strenuous effort to co-ordinate a group of distinguished authorities on Venizelos in the community of scholars on Greece. <c2><a9> editorial matter and organisation Paschalis M.

2480,Beyond cold technology: A systematic review and meta-analysis on emotions in technology-based learning environments,"Understanding emotions in technology-based learning environments (TBLEs) has become a paramount goal across different research communities, but to date, these have operated in relative isolation. Based on control-value theory (Pekrun, 2006), we reviewed 186 studies examining emotions in TBLEs that were published between 1965 and 2018. We extracted effect sizes quantifying relations between emotions (enjoyment, curiosity/interest, anxiety, anger/frustration, confusion, boredom) and their antecedents (control-value appraisals, prior knowledge, gender, TBLE characteristics) and outcomes (engagement, learning strategies, achievement). Mean effects largely supported hypotheses (e.g., positive relations between enjoyment and appraisals, achievement, and cognitive support) and remained relatively stable across moderators. These findings imply that levels of emotions differ across TBLEs, but that their functional relations with appraisals and learning are equivalent across environments. Implications for research and designing emotionally sound TBLEs are discussed. <c2><a9> 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Loderer, K and Pekrun, R and Lester, J C",0,10.1016/j.learninstruc.2018.08.002,1763
2483,What makes something interesting?,"Reviews the book, Exploring the Psychology of Interest by Paul J. Silvia (see record 2006-03939-000). There has been a lack of a modern text that reviews research on interest. Now Paul J. Silvia has written a fascinating book about the concept. He covers the development from Berlyne's (1960) work on curiosity in the 1950s and 1960s and Tomkins's (1962) introduction of the idea that interest is an emotion through the most recent research in several fields of basic and applied psychology. He attempts to achieve an integration of the diverse traditions and describes an interesting new theory of interest, and his book takes the field a large step forward. Much of the work discussed by Silvia refers to curiosity rather than interest. The two concepts may refer to different psychological processes that are reflected in their semantics, but so far there has been no convincing empirical research supporting the distinction. Silvia treats them as synonyms, and so did Berlyne. Silvia has done a superb job in reviewing several diverse research traditions and pointing out how they may be related. Clearly, psychological research on interest promises to be very interesting in the near future.

2484,School Health Curriculum Project for Southeastern Michigan. Evaluation Report: School Implementation of Program,"This fourth grade project was piloted in seven Detroit area schools to ascertain whether the School Health Curriculum could be implemented on a broader scale. It was anticipated that the majority of the schools would be unable to finish all units of the curriculum, so student achievement was not assessed. The evaluation focused instead on observation of the school setting to determine the degree of curricular implementation, and on assessing the attitudes of students, teachers, principals, and non-participating teachers toward the project. Included in this evaluation report are summary results of the site visitations and interviews, and of the student, teacher, principal, and non-participating teacher surveys. The on-site observer confirmed that although three schools reported completing all seven units of the curriculum, only one did in fact complete all. Student attitudes toward health instruction were quite positive compared to their attitudes toward reading, math, social studies and science. Principals thought highly of the project, but some expressed concern about financing and training teachers for its broad scale implementation. Teachers were also positive about the project and exceedingly positive about students' reaction to it. Non-participating teachers indicated they were interested in participating, but their interest was attributed more to curiosity than to knowledge of the program and its benefits. Apparently the project can be implemented full-scale, given sufficient training, space, and supportive services. Future studies should focus upon differences in achievement and in student attitudes toward health instruction.

2488,Enhancing German language learners' intercultural communicative competence through the on-line exchange project ICE,"LA: English The acquisition of intercultural communicative competence (ICC) has become a primary goal in foreign language education (Byram, 1997; Kramsch, 1993) and is based on the underlying assumption that language and culture are strongly intertwined. It has been suggested that telecollaborative exchanges with native speakers in the target culture can enhance the development of ICC (Furstenberg et al., 2001). However, studies have shown that on-line exchanges alone might reinforce existing stereotypes or cause erroneous generalizations to be made (Itakura, 2004; Chun & Wade, 2004). At present, not enough is known about how on-line exchanges can effectively be integrated into the foreign language classroom in order to maximize the educational outcomes of intercultural projects (O'Dowd & Eberbach, 2004). This study sought to fill this gap by examining the oral classroom interactions that took place as a follow-up to the learners' on-line interactions with native speakers in the target country. Twenty-three intermediate German students at a university in the U.S. and 45 students at a university in Germany participated in an on-line exchange over the course of an academic year. Each U.S. student was required to lead a classroom discussion on those aspects of the on-line exchange that were of particular interest to him/her. Seven discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and examined for evidence of the different components of intercultural communicative competence. The analysis of the data revealed that the learners displayed attitudes of curiosity about the target culture as they constructed cultural knowledge based on the on-line forum entries. However, when comparing their findings about the target culture with their own culture, they often expressed preference for their own culture and were not always able to establish a 'sphere of interculturality,' i.e., looking at both cultures from an insider's and an outsider's perspective. Rather, they interpreted their findings from the point of view of their own culture. This reinforces the notion that on-line exchanges in and of themselves are not sufficient to help learners develop ICC. Follow-up discussions and critical reflections in the classroom are of crucial importance to ensure that ICC is enhanced.","Wade, Evelyn Reder",0,,1768

As we worked on the project, we were self-reflexively aware of working from a particular theory (the coordinated management of meaning, or CMM) and developing that theory in the process. Our reflections led to 3 criteria for evaluating our work and practical theory in general: engaging in continuing conversations with participants, practitioners, and theorists; celebrating and working with the interests of the participants; and developing principles and models that increase the abilities of all involved in the project to describe what is happening perspicaciously and to act into unfinished situations prudently. These criteria are consonant with a particular theoretical temperament: taking a participant's perspective on social worlds understood as pluralistic in which the theorist's goal is the continued exercise of curiosity. The 5-phase, 10-step SHEDD model was developed in successive iterations of the dialogue process and is presented as an example of the work of practical theorists.","Pearce, K A and Pearce, W B",0,10.1111/j.1468-2885.2001.tb00235.x,1769

2493,"Education, empire and social change in nineteenth century England","This article discusses the effects of imperialism on British (or chiefly English) social life and education in the nineteenth century rather than examining the effects on the colonised as is usually done. It is shown that the nineteenth century was infused with different visual and written images which helped develop attitudes and ideas which influenced social change in Britain. The oimperial gazeo demonstrated a fascination with the unknown and exotic; a scientific curiosity to discover, collect, classify and explain; an economic desire to find and exploit; and mixed motivations from religious, humanitarian and nationalistic impulses to convert, ociviliseo and dominate. In different ways and at different levels this entailed a wish to oknowo and an urge to pass on presumed otruthso that interlocked imperial influences into educational enterprise, although not necessarily within formal schooling. As the century progressed, events within the expanding empire, combining with scientific theories, helped to develop cultural arrogance, dominated by ideas of white, Western superiority. Yet there was no homogenous, uncontested discourse. As post-imperial debates suggest, chronological shifts, differing gender and class responses are significant. Effects could be paradoxical as those of imperial opportunities and rhetoric were on women's lives. Examples from other imperial nations, especially France and the Netherlands, indicate parallel imperial, sometimes imperialistic, concerns and interests and varying consequences, but in different contexts. The paper ends with some suggestions on how the difficulties of analysing the effects of empire on social change and education could be addressed within history of education.","Watts, Ruth",0,10.1080/00309230903407519,1771

2497,Speculative Practices: Utilizing InfoVis to Explore Untapped Literary Collections,"In this paper we exemplify how information visualization supports speculative thinking, hypotheses testing, and preliminary interpretation processes as part of literary research. While InfoVis has become a buzz topic in the digital humanities, skepticism remains about how effectively it integrates into and expands on traditional humanities research approaches. From an InfoVis perspective, we lack case studies that show the specific design challenges that make literary studies and humanities research at large a unique application area for information visualization. We examine these questions through our case study of the Speculative W@nderverse, a visualization tool that was designed to enable the analysis and exploration of an untapped literary collection consisting of thousands of science fiction short stories. We present the results of two empirical studies that involved general-interest readers and literary scholars who used the evolving visualization prototype as part of their research for over a year. Our findings suggest a design space for visualizing literary collections that is defined by (1) their academic and public relevance, (2) the tension between qualitative vs. quantitative methods of interpretation, (3) result- vs. process-driven approaches to InfoVis, and (4) the unique material and visual qualities of cultural collections. Through the Speculative W@nderverse we demonstrate how visualization can bridge these sometimes contradictory perspectives by cultivating curiosity and providing entry points into literary collections while, at the same time, supporting multiple aspects of humanities research processes.","Hinrichs, Uta and Forlini, Stefania and Moynihan, Bridget",0,10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467452,1773

2499,THE ROLE OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ON EDUCATIONAL SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES,"Scientific divulgation is an important way of keeping society up to date on scientific issues to promote interactions between society and science that are not common in other situations. It is intended to arouse curiosity in order to understand the nature of everyday processes from a scientific point of view. In the last years the universities are promoting educational activities in order to get science to the society. The Faculty of Sciences of the University of Granada has developed different proposals both involving in an international and national frame, such as ``La Noche de los Investigadores'', ``Semana de la Ciencia'', ``Aula Cientifica Permanente'', ``Cafe con Ciencia'', ``Ciencia y Sociedad'', etc. These activities are proposed and guided by University professors from different research areas. In these activities, the possibility of voluntary participation is offered to undergraduate and postgraduate university students. Interested students have to be formed by professors before developing these activities being this training complementary to their specific academic schedule. Student implication would be an effective tool to get scientific and communicative skills as well as other abilities. Among them could be highlighted the design of short scientific protocols to learn how to organize laboratory tasks in a set time. Also, the students would get the ability to synthesize main ideas to communicate essential scientific concepts in an accessible language for non-experts. Furthermore, the public speaking would be improved, fact that nowadays should be upgraded in the University students for their formation for improving social skills. In addition, students would acquire other abilities such the capacity to face doubts raised regarding to a scientific aspects, enhance their self-confidence, promote student-professor relations, take the teacher's role, enhance their curriculum vitae for the future, etc. These activities would enable the student to improve their formation for their professional future.","Rufino-Palomares, E E and Perez-Jimenez, A and Trenzado-Romero, C E",0,,1775
2500,The First 20 Years of the Australian Behaviour Modification Association,"Plans are underway to commemorate the 20th birthday of the ABMA at the 17th National Conference to be held in Perth in 1994. Attaining such milestones usually prompts, in addition to ceremony and celebration, interest in history, roots, trends and resolutions for the future. There may be curiosity about what is being celebrated. It is easy enough to count back to the first National Conference in 1978 to arrive at the number 17, but the 20th birthday is not so obvious. My purpose here is to assuage that curiosity and give my version of the events that have followed. <c2><a9> 1994, The Author(s).

2501,Just curious: Children's use of digital reference for unimposed queries and its importance in informal education,"This research investigated the informal use of two children's digital reference services that were used for purposes unintended by the designers. The motivation for this research was to explore the ways that children bend to their own informal uses the formal tools designed to support their education. Research questions included, How and with what frequency do children use digital reference services to answer their own questions? Do digital reference services support self-initiated learning? Could digital reference services support the transfer of student motivation and curiosity from formal education to informal education? What do instructional and software designers need to consider in creating tools that support a notion of transformed education and learning? Results answered these questions and uncovered several unanticipated findings. Digital reference services were shown to support efforts to interest children in science-related careers as early as fourth or fifth grade and to support self-initiated learning in science. Unanticipated findings showed that students ask different kinds of questions as they progress through school, and they should receive training in the use of digital reference services in elementary school. Further conclusions provide insights for digital reference software and service design and suggestions for more strategic pedagogical use of digital references services. <c2><a9> 2005 The Board of Trustees, University of Illinois.","Silverstein, J",0,10.1353/lib.2006.0020,1777
2502,A brief history of psychoanalysis in Argentina,"The peculiar development--in both extension and depth--of psychoanalysis and its practice in Argentina, has been the object of interest and curiosity in diverse spheres. Inquiry into the determining factors of the phenomenal expansion, in this corner of the planet, of an avant-garde discipline requiring such sophisticated practice is an ongoing project. This article is an informal chronicle that may contribute to answering questions better addressed by historians and social scientists. The history of psychoanalysis in Argentina may be divided, perhaps a bit arbitrarily, into five periods: a preinstitutional period, a pioneering period, a period of consolidation, a period that comprises the crisis of the 1970s, and the present. Lopez Ballesteros's Spanish translation of the complete works of Sigmund Freud began circulating in Buenos Aires in 1922. Intellectuals, professionals, and eager dilettantes found a fascinating subject to discuss in social gatherings. Moving away from the well-established psychiatrists of the previous period, of great renown in traditional intellectual circles, a group of eager young professionals, thirsty for innovation and led by Arnaldo Rascovsky and Enrique Pichon Riviere, emerged in the late 1930s. The period of consolidation corresponds approximately to the 1960s. In contrast with earlier periods, in recent years psychoanalysis has had to struggle resolutely to differentiate itself and avoid losing its identity in a complex and intricate ""psy-world.""

2503,Regulating for environmental improvement in the New Zealand forestry sector,"Interest in the role of regulation in support of environmental imperatives and sustainability more generally has corresponded with a broader academic curiosity about evolving regulatory contexts. In this respect, there is a discernible trend towards a rebalancing of the regulatory mix towards an increasing emphasis on private regulation, corresponding with a withdrawal of the state and market liberalism. In the re-regulation of the environment, the issue arises as to what balance should be struck between public and private influences. In determining this mix, firms are concerned with issues of economic efficiency and competitiveness, while governments are focussed on institutional effectiveness. The overriding concern, though, should be with environmental quality. The paper addresses issues of re-regulation and particularly the shift towards an increasing emphasis on private regulation. The context for the work is the regulation of the New Zealand (NZ) forest industry and specifically preferences within the industry for a greater reliance on self-regulation in respect of the environment.

2504,Seeking knowledge: An exploratory study of the role of social networks in the adoption of Ebooks by historians,"Despite their initial slow diffusion in society, Ebooks have recently garnered renewed interest from academics as part of a move toward the digital humanities. To examine how humanists are adopting Ebooks, we focus on the first stage, the Knowledge Phase, of Rogers' model of the diffusion of innovations. Central to this stage is the study of adopter attitudes toward the innovation and the role played by social networks in the adoption process. Historians were selected as the population of study because of their close relationship to the printed book, both as a research tool and as an academic goal. Six semi-structured interviews were conducted with historians and then analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Our preliminary results show that historians had both positive and negative attitudes towards the Ebook. Often the same person showed eagerness and curiosity to adopt certain features of Ebooks whilst showing some degree of reluctance and skepticism. We identified the Role of the Social Network (RSN) as an important factor in the decision-making process of historians. Respondents frequently mentioned the subject specialist librarian for history as a key source of information. In addition, historians went not only to peers inside of the department, but also to friends and colleagues elsewhere when seeking advice on working with Ebooks. As Ebooks gain ground within academia, studies such as this, that focus on a single discipline, will be necessary to understand why scholars make the decision to adopt or reject. The study results found that subject librarians can act as change agents on the university campus. For this reason, the impact they have on the use of new technologies by academics needs further attention.","Quan-Haase, A and Martin, K",0,10.1002/meet.2011.14504801128,1780
2505,Is less actually more? The usefulness of educational mini-games,"Interest in educational gaming is on the rise once again, and particular interest has started to peak in the area of lightweight educational mini-games. But are these games really as useful as people suggest, or are they simply too shallow to convey sufficient pedagogical meaning? And how do we assess how well these games measure up as educational resources? This paper first generates a ``conclusive'' list Of educational requirements from a structured review of other researchers proposed requirements. It then presents details of the three most interesting educational mini-games taken from an investigation of around 30. Whilst some games were able to offer immersive, curiosity-provoking experiences full of relevant information, many of the games were shallow, formulaic, and lacking in information. Finally, conclusions and future work are proposed, including the packaging of mini-games into compendia to add depth, the use of mini-games in blended learning scenarios, and mechanisms to harvest the relatively simple player interactions to assist learner assessment. These findings aim to help educators make a more informed decision as to whether these games are right for their educational aims.","Frazer, Alex and Argles, David and Wills, Gary",0,10.1109/ICALT.2007.173,1781
2506,Bagpipes and Artichokes: Surprise as a Stimulus to Learning in the Elementary Music Classroom,"Incorporating surprise into music instruction can stimulate student attention, curiosity, and interest. Novelty focuses attention in the reticular activating system, increasing the potential for brain memory storage. Elementary ages are ideal for introducing novel instruments, pieces, composers, or styles of music. Young children have fewer experiences to draw from and less information stored in the memory. Like music, surprise is time-related. Opportunities to incorporate surprise in music instruction are plentiful. Mystery involves uncertainty and can engage a child's imagination, fostering an environment ripe for discovery of new or unexpected information. When expectation is strong, surprise has its greatest effect and opportunities for learning are optimal. Music students can be primed for surprise through rehearsal and routine. In instruction, surprise should be relevant to content, age-appropriate, memorable, creative, and positive. Children can benefit from a debriefing following the surprise and from help in transferring new information to familiar content or experiences.","Jacobi, Bonnie Schaffhauser",0,,1782
2507,"Review of A Handbook on Drug and Alcohol Abuse: The Biomedical Aspects, 4th ed","Reviews the book, A Handbook on Drug and Alcohol Abuse: The Biomedical Aspects, 4th ed by Gail Winger, James H. Woods, and Frederick G. Hofmann (see record 2004-15180-000). Drs. Winger, Woods, and Hofmann, instead, have produced a scientific, concise, and comprehensive primer on virtually all drugs of abuse. As with previous editions, the authors have crafted this book for a wide target audience--from undergraduate pharmacology students to medical students, to substance abuse specialists, and to laypeople with a curiosity about drugs of abuse. The book opens with a short description of how to define drug abuse and then turns to recent trends of drug use in the United States, providing a general description of the neurological aspects of drug use. The heart of the book is divided into specific chapters that discuss all of the major drugs of . abuse: tobacco/nicotine, opioids, CNS depressants (alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, solvents, inhalants), marijuana, and CNS stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines). Of interest, there is an entire chapter dedicated to ""club drugs,"" namely, gamma hydroxybutyrate, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (Ecstasy), and ketamine. Each chapter concisely and concretely describes the epidemiology, trends of use, and pharmacology of the drug of abuse. Two new features of this edition are a chapter devoted entirely to the medical issues associated with drug abuse and an expansion of the chapter on drug abuse and the law. Overall, this handbook is clearly written and presents the information in a well-organized and scientific fashion. Its brevity is appropriate, especially for the reader who is not a specialist in addictions. However, very little space is given over to how to treat substance-dependent individuals; this is not the book's purpose. Also, the book could use a concluding chapter and perhaps the addition of more illustrations, especially a visual depiction of the drug of abuse, to aid the reader.

2508,Characteristics of convergence learning experience using an educational documentary film,"The purpose of the study was to investigate the characteristics of convergence learning experience when learners study integrated learning contents from various academic subjects. Specifically, cognitive and emotional experiences and their changes over time were investigated. Eight undergraduate and graduate students participated in the study. They watched an educational documentary entitled Mathematics and Civilization, which included content from various subjects such as mathematics, history, economy, and politics. They were interviewed in-depth about their learning experiences from watching the documentary. Participants reported that convergence learning experience included a personalization process in which they incorporated learning contents based on their own personal experience, interest, and knowledge; especially, personal background and curiosity were factors facilitating personalized meaning making on learning contents. We also found that cognitive change was accompanied by an emotional change when participants transformed their own knowledge structure from fear to pleasure for learning. These results suggest that in convergence education, a learner's prior knowledge and experience would play a key role in constructing the learner's own meanings and knowledge structure more so than in traditional subject-based education. Also, social interaction could facilitate convergence learning experience by allowing learners to share in others' learning experiences and perspectives.","Shin, Jongho and Cho, Eunbyul",0,10.1007/s12564-015-9375-8,1784

2510,Introduction-Substance abuse issues around the world,"For quite some time, I have had an interest in using the creative therapies-art, play, dance, music, drama, and poetry-for the treatment of a variety of issues including sexual abuse, eating disorders, and domestic violence. This work is dedicated to the use of these creative approaches to the treatment of alcohol and substance abuse. Given that most of the chapters in this book cover substance abuse issues within the United States and Canada, I wanted to provide the reader with a snapshot of chemical dependency issues around the globe. This chapter is by no means comprehensive but does cover the most recent research with respect to this issue. My hope is that the reader will share in my curiosity about how this pervasive problem affects other countries. Substance abuse creates a host of other issues affecting individuals, families, and society: Chemical dependency is associated with increases in violence, lower worker productivity, increased mental health problems, and sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV infection (Probst, Gold, & Caybom, 2008). Substance use and abuse is on the rise, particularly with the use of methamphetamines. Just to give an example, worldwide production of illegal methamphetamine and amphetamine is estimated to be as high as 332 metric tons per year with 27 million recent users of which 2.7 million live in Europe, 4.3 million in the Americas, 16.7 million in Asia, 1.8 million in Africa, and 600 thousand in Oceania (Zabransky, 2007).

2512,Examining the Use of Online Storytelling as a Motivation for Young Learners to Practice Narrative Skills,"The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the use of online storytelling as a motivation for young learners to practice narrative skills, measured through active choice, persistence and mental effort (Pintrich & Schunk, 2002). Web analytics was used to track 24 home schooled participants of an online application to teach a 21st century skill driven curriculum consisting of character driven plot story construction in a social learning environment. Additional quantitative data was collected by assignment submissions, a survey, and email exchanges with the participants. The results showed that 79.2 percent choose to engage with the application as an indicator of active choice. However, only 20.8 percent of users completed the full curriculum as an indicator of persistence by submitting a final story video. Indicator Mental Effort revealed that one fifth of the total study participants completed the scaffolded curriculum by submitting a final assignment video. Additional data suggested that curiosity may have an influence on active choice. Indicator Persistence infers that technology problems may have hampered persistence, though one outlier exhibited flow by completing the curriculum twice. As suggested by the literature, the results of this study revealed that interest was related to intrinsic motivation and engagement with the media. Additionally, instructor led feedback videos may play a role in helping learners to develop self-efficacy. This exploratory study demonstrates how meaningful measures of motivation may be used in online learning environments.

2514,The experience of being a psychotherapist,"A recently appointed high-up official in a Mental Health Trust had courteously set up a meeting with me in pursuit of his conscientious wish to understand more of the services provided within his new responsibilities. He naturally wanted to know of what psychotherapy consisted. He displayed a genuine curiosity, a wish to learn and to place the psychotherapy business alongside his previous experience of other businesses. He had worked in industry and he wanted to make a parallel between the activity of the psychotherapist and his own experience of giving career advice to junior staff in his previous executive positions. At the same time, he displayed a characteristic fear: people could get an excess of advice and support and might grow to rely too much upon it. He feared that receiving psychotherapy might become an indulgence; it might create a risky dependence. He also displayed a belief that there could be something unhealthy about talking a lot about feelings. In saying such things he revealed all that characterises a very English attitude towards the subject. In many ways it is surprising that someone accepting a position in a Mental Health Trust in the United Kingdom at the present time would be comfortable with his own attitude. The field of psychodynamic psychotherapy owes a great deal to the British school of psychoanalytic thinking. It is also true that the subject, as a professional practice, is now undergoing a veritable explosion in the numbers of psychotherapists within Britain. The recently established register of psychotherapists demonstrates how many organisations are currently developing standards of practice and are training psychotherapists. At one time such trainings were almost exclusive to London (with one training each in Aberdeen and Edinburgh). Now psychotherapy courses are available in many centres throughout Britain, with, for the first time, an evolution of university-based diplomas and masters degrees in the subject. There is an even more marked development in the more <e2><80><98>sanitised<e2><80><99>, apparently cheaper form of talking treatments which are encompassed by the concepts and practices of counselling. In my discussion with this senior executive, I chose not to confront the inconsistency in his attitude and side-stepped the issues. I talked of the particular psychiatric conditions that interest me and for which <e2><80><98>psychological treatments<e2><80><99> alone are the only ones that have been shown to work. (These are, specifically, the so-called eating disorders, especially those associated with self-starvation, which have been shown to be singularly unresponsive to pharmacological therapies, and for which effective residential treatments are expensive and scarce; see Dare et al. 1995). My response was tactical and I failed to talk with him about the origins of his beliefs about what is for me my life<e2><80><99>s work. Of course, his views are indeed common and representative and have an important place in any understanding of the phenomenon of psychotherapy. The common attitude to psychotherapy includes two persistent myths. <c2><a9> 1997 Ved P.Varma, selection and editorial matter.","Dare, C",0,10.4324/9780203360163-7,1788
2517,"Developmental robotics, optimal artificial curiosity, creativity, music, and the fine arts","Even in the absence of external reward, babies and scientists and others explore their world. Using some sort of adaptive predictive world model, they improve their ability to answer questions such as what happens if I do this or that? They lose interest in both the predictable things and those predicted to remain unpredictable despite some effort. One can design curious robots that do the same. The author's basic idea (1990, 1991) for doing so is a reinforcement learning (RL) controller is rewarded for action sequences that improve the predictor. Here, this idea is revisited in the context of recent results on optimal predictors and optimal RL machines. Several new variants of the basic principle are proposed. Finally, it is pointed out how the fine arts can be formally understood as a consequence of the principle: given some subjective observer, great works of art and music yield observation histories exhibiting more novel, previously unknown compressibility/regularity/predictability (with respect to the observer's particular learning algorithm) than lesser works, thus deepening the observer's understanding of the world and what is possible in it.","Schmidhuber, Juergen",0,10.1080/09540090600768658,1789

This is an opportune time to reevaluate and renew the teaching of this cataclysmic event. Most people have been affected by the political, economic, and social consequences of the War. But perhaps the most important reason to rededicate ourselves to teaching about World War II is that the experience is still near enough in time to provide retrospective interest for those who lived through it and to spark intellectual curiosity among those unborn at the time.

2519,The Self-Regulation of Curiosity and Interest During the Information Search Process of Adolescent Students,"In a world of increasing information and communications possibilities, the difficulty for users of information systems and services may not lie in finding information but in filtering and integrating it into a cohesive whole. To do this, information seekers must know when and how to effectively use cognitive strategies to regulate their own thinking, motivation, and actions. Sometimes this is difficult when the topic is interesting and one is driven to explore it in great depth. This article reports on a qualitative study that, in the course of exploring the thinking and emotions of 10 adolescents during the information search process, uncovered patterns of behavior that are related to curiosity and interest. The larger purpose of the study was to investigate the metacognitive knowledge of adolescents, ages 16-18, as they searched for, selected, and used information to complete a school-based information task. The study found that the curiosity experienced by adolescents during the search process was accompanied by feelings of both pleasure and pain and that both feelings needed to be managed in order to navigate a pathway through the search process. The self-regulation of curiosity and interest was a clear and distinct metacognitive strategy fueled by metacognitive knowledge related to understanding one's own curiosity and the emotions attached to it.","Bowler, Leanne",0,10.1002/asi.21334,1791
2520,Interest Development and Its Relation to Curiosity: Needed Neuroscientific Research,"In order to consider the relation between interest and curiosity, we first review various points of view on this issue, and discuss the scientific importance of making a distinction between the two concepts. Next, we explain that interest defined as a psychological state and as a cognitive and motivational variable can be supported to develop. Furthermore, the content-specific development of interest provides a different type of information search than curiosity, defined as the motivation to close a knowledge gap driven by uncertainty. We also discuss how earlier and later phases of developing interest are related to curiosity. More specifically, we suggest that (a) once curiosity is resolved, it may not result in any further engagement, or it may trigger a situational interest that could develop, and (b) when an existing, more developed interest initiates, supports or is related to a particular instance of triggered curiosity, continued engagement (and information search) is likely. In concluding, we point to needed neuroscientific research that could contribute to further clarifying the relation between interest and curiosity. This information is as important to research, as it is to practice.","Hidi, Suzanne and Renninger, K Ann",0,10.1007/s10648-019-09491-3,1792
2521,Developing the legal environment for business in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia: Comments and suggestions,"Closing the door of ijtihad or independent reasoning in the 10th century resulted in a legal system that was often at odds with the modern world, especially in the area of contracts. Although it is considered to be a big breakthrough at the present time that some of the religious figures or ulama in Saudi Arabia have finally expressed their interest in the codifi-cation of laws, the issue has to be dealt with from a different, not only religious, perspective. The importance of comparative law must be expressed when dealing with all commercial matters. Promoting and encouraging intellectual curiosity in different legal areas through academic institutions and research centres will drive the scholars to study the commercial law subjects from a number of different perspectives. In that process, they will develop a better understanding of their own system and know the way of developing it. <c2><a9> 2013 Torki A. Alshubaiki.","Alshubaiki, T A",0,10.1163/15730255-12341268,1793

It discusses how goals might change in light of perceived time horizons, particularly shifting toward social and emotional goals with age. It also explores the notion that curiosity and interest can be strong motivations to learn new information, in both formal and informal learning environments. The chapter highlights in particular how younger and older people remember information that is made important to them either by the experimenter through the assignment of higher point values to certain items or as a more practical feature of the stimuli. It then explores decision-making and aging in a variety of contexts that reflect how goals and priorities may (or may not) change across the lifespan and how intrinsic versus extrinsic motivational factors may differentially affect cognitive processes during the aging process.

2523,When Iâ€™m 64: Effects of an interdisciplinary gerontology course on first-year undergraduatesâ€™ perceptions of aging,"One challenge for gerontology is getting more students interested in aging at an earlier point in their academic career. This study evaluated the impact of an interdisciplinary course on aging designed for first-year undergraduate students. The course aimed to expand students<e2><80><99> appreciation of the personal and professional relevance of aging issues, with the goal of expanding their aging-related curricular and career interests. Main outcome variables of the study included knowledge of older adults and aging, attitudes toward older adults, and anxiety about personal aging. Participants included an intervention group enrolled in the course and a control group not enrolled in the course. Compared to baseline, at the end of the semester students in the class had more knowledge about aging and more positive explicit attitudes toward older adults, but their implicit attitudes toward older adults and anxiety about aging did not change. Control students showed no changes. These findings suggest that objective knowledge of aging and explicit attitudes improve with curricular intervention, but implicit attitudes and anxiety might be more difficult to change. Gerontology education is a complex undertaking whose diverse goals must be clearly articulated in order to guide curricular interventions and incite curiosity among young undergraduate students. <c2><a9> 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Merz, C C and Stark, S L and Morrow-Howell, N L and Carpenter, B D",0,10.1080/02701960.2016.1144600,1795

2527,Survival methods: Anthropological approaches for successful museums,"From the time of the first mouseion in the third century Before the Common Era (BCE), the prominence and importance of museums in society has steadily risen. Through the centuries, as societies and public interests changed, so too did the very purpose and nature of museums evolve from houses of curiosities to finely organized depositories of historical and archaeological explorations and, finally, to cultural institutions promoting education and learning. Significant political, societal, economic, and cultural changes in the United States in recent decades have once again caused a major shift in the structure and role of American museums. My study takes an anthropological approach to analyzing the changes in the public<e2><80><99>s interests and motivations surrounding museums, as well as the challenging economic environment faced by these institutions. Based on this information, my study identifies innovative cultural and economic survival methods that museums can implement as part of museum best practices in order to thrive.

The author's writing style evokes in the reader a sense of curiosity, interest, and anticipation that makes it difficult to put the book down, as if the suspense is always in crescendo. I found it difficult to predict the next move. The author not only demonstrates great conviction about his theoretical point of reference, but also carefully balances it with his tolerance of doubt and self-questioning, compounded by his acute awareness of the parallel with his own development, using that as a helpful resonance chamber while fully aware of the countertransference dangers. It was very refreshing to follow how the intersubjective approach that he strategically follows to create/deliver Daniel's new full self was sorted out from his very impressive familiarity with many other theoretical points of view, which I believe allow him to have a genuine freedom to choose the one he experienced as the most effective and useful for his patient. He confirms what has been said with clearer tones lately in our discipline, that the analysis has to be fitting to the patient rather than to the theoretical preference of the analyst.

Today, the term ""school readiness"" is used to refer to the bundle of knowledge, skills and motivational behaviors that are associated with children's successful entry into school.

2531,The expatriate experience: Teaching nursing across Eastern and Western cultures,"Comments on the article in this issue by Melby et al. (see record 2008-06928-007), who described the lived experience of English-speaking Western nurse educators teaching in East Asian countries. Using an existential phenomenologic approach, Melby et al. identified several themes, including differing job expectations, pedagogical disconnections, cost of expatriate experiences, and adapting and finding purposes. The current author suggests that the findings generated from this study are significant, because they suggest that cultural immersion is insufficient for developing cultural competency. Gaining cultural competence is an ongoing, conscious effort for expatriate nursing educators. Mutual interest, curiosity, and desire are keys to further advancing nursing education, research, and practice on a global scale. Together, native and expatriate nursing educators can improve the quality and effectiveness of teaching across cultures.

2532,Martin Joosâ€™s readings in linguistics: A publication history,"The book Readings in Linguistics edited by Martin Joos is one of the best known collections of papers ever published in the field of linguistics. In this article I trace its publication history, from Bernard Bloch<e2><80><99>s idea in 1946 for an anthology of important work in descriptive linguists, to the several editions of Joos<e2><80><99>s reader between 1957 and 1995, to the present day, where citations to the book are still quite frequent. Making extensive use of unpublished material in various archives in the United States, I outline in detail the exchanges between Joos and other linguists around its publication, as well as the critical reviews that were published of the book. I attempt to explain why a collection of papers, the majority of which were published in the 1940s, is still of great interest. I offer two reasons. The first derives from the material in Joos<e2><80><99>s prefaces to the various editions and from Joos<e2><80><99>s editorial comments on the included articles. Practitioners of every current approach to linguistics have cited some of this material either as an opening wedge against opposing approaches or to express smug satisfaction that we know more about how science works now than we did more than a half-century ago. The second is that it provides a fascinating historical record of how linguistics used to be done <e2><80><94> not so long ago that the approach documented is a mere historiographical curiosity, but also not so recently as to be no more than a quaint version of current theory <c2><a9> John Benjamins Publishing Company","Newmeyer, F J",0,10.1075/hl.00052.new,1802
2533,Sexuality in Childhood,"When conducting research on childhood sexual behavior, cultural bias may contribute to difficulty in gathering sound data in that survey respondents may balk at the use of the term ""sexual"" to describe behaviors engaged in by infants and children, particularly within societies that are less open regarding sexuality (e.g., the United States). While some researchers and theorists have noted that it is possible to describe aspects of children's sexual behavior using categories with a corresponding adult behavior or presentation (including self-stimulation, sexual interest, exhibitionism, sexual knowledge, and voyeuristic behaviors), there are some key points that differentiate the presentation of such behaviors in children versus adults. It is possible that emphasizing these differences may make the larger discussion of normative childhood sexuality more palatable and, thus, more possible within a greater variety of cultures. Toward this end, Heiman et al. have suggested that discussion and investigation of child sexuality might be freed if researchers modify the description of the behaviors under study from ""sexual"" to ""self-exploratory."" We would further suggest that there is a meaningful difference between behaviors motivated by curiosity or ""scientific"" interest and those driven by sexual interest and, importantly, between behaviors that are pleasurable and those that are sexual. Put another way, although some of the behaviors in which young children engage involve their genitalia, they are not necessarily sexual in nature. A second useful distinction between adult and child sexuality relates to the fact that an individual's intentions and cognitions serve an important function in determining whether a behavior is sexual per se. For instance, while numerous parental and professional reports describe infants, toddlers, and preschoolers touching their own genitals, this self-stimulation is qualitatively different in meaning, intention, and experience than similar behaviors would be later in the developmental span. For this reason, and as mentioned at the opening of this chapter, we believe that childhood sexuality is more usefully described as the foundation for, rather than an early sign of, adult sexuality. With appreciation for the still evolving state of the field's current knowledge base regarding child sexuality, this chapter seeks to (a) provide an overview of theoretical frameworks that may prove useful in considering the processes and experiences that underlie the development of child sexuality, (b) summarize current knowledge regarding childhood sexuality from birth to 12 years of age, (c) consider briefly cross-cultural findings to clarify cultural differences in youngsters' sexual behavior, (d) describe selected nonnormative child sexual experiences and outcomes, and (e) discuss recommendations for future research in this area.

2535,Physician empathy and compassion for inmate-patients in the correctional health care setting,"The authors investigated empathy and compassion among physicians who work in correctional settings. A questionnaire was sent to two groups: correctional and noncorrectional physicians. Correctional physicians reported gratification in helping patients and responded similarly to noncorrectional physicians on empathy items. They also showed greater interest in their patients' conditions. But physicians who worked exclusively in corrections reported lower scores on items that assessed specific components of empathy, particularly emotional resonance and intrinsic curiosity about the patient as an individual. Thus, correctional physicians display empathy and compassion just as noncorrectional physicians do; yet differences may exist. Correctional physicians may not be as emotionally attuned to their patients and may display less curiosity about their feelings. Therefore, their work satisfaction may not be derived from the interpersonal component of medical care.

2536,Revisiting ``what is a document?'',"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a reconsideration of Michael Buckland's important question, ``What is a document?'', analysing the point and purpose of definitions of ``document'' and ``documentation''. Design/methodology/approach - Two philosophical notions of the point of definitions are contrasted: John Stuart Mill's concept of a ``real'' definition, purporting to specify the nature of the definiendum; and a concept of definition based upon a foundationalist philosophy of language. Both conceptions assume that a general, philosophical justification for using words as we do is always in order. This assumption is criticized by deploying Hilary Putnam's arguments against the orthodox Wittgensteinian interpretation of criteria governing the use of language. The example of the cabinets of curiosities of the sixteenth-century English and European virtuosi is developed to show how one might productively think about what documents might be, but without a definition of a document. Findings - Other than for specific, instrumentalist purposes (often appropriate for specific case studies), there is no general philosophical reason for asking, what is a document? There are good reasons for pursuing studies of documentation without the impediments of definitions of ``document'' or ``documentation''. Originality/value - The paper makes an original contribution to the new interest in documentation studies by providing conceptual resources for multiplying, rather than restricting, the areas of application of the concepts of documents and documentation.","Frohmann, Bernd",0,10.1108/00220410910937624,1805

Curiosity and interest are used as interchangeable terms by some scholars, while assumed by others to be separable. In an effort to reconcile research on these constructs, this special issue bridges disciplinary boundaries to address three main questions: How do curiosity and interest develop? How can they be supported in classrooms? To what extent do curiosity and interest uniquely predict educational outcomes? Included in this special issue are five articles presenting perspectives on curiosity and interest from educational, developmental, and neuroscientific approaches. The special issue concludes with two commentaries summarizing these perspectives and providing an ambitious agenda for future research and practice.","Peterson, Emily Grossnickle and Hidi, Suzanne",0,10.1007/s10648-019-09513-0,1806

Results show the presence of a widespread moderate religious sensibility, generally based on moral Christian values, but also with spiritualistic and animistic and sometimes almost spiritistic connotations; while a real participation in Church activities and cults is pretty low. There are three Religious Types: A) ""Catholics"" (45.0%), who believe strongly in God, praying and attending functions with some regularity; very attached to family and children, have an attitude of solidarity towards neighbor; they are related to traditional culture and distrustful towards immigrants; they tend to be conformists and relatively superstitious; they are conscientious, concerned about the risks that life presents, and a little 'suffering'; they ate mote often women, married with children, older and culturally low. B) ""Conformists"" (31.6%), which generally adhere to the values of Christianity, but without activism; they are intent mainly to their daily chores, sociable but a little suspicious towards others; they tend to give greatest importance to effective concreteness and success; they are relatively young and educated, but also married and with children; C) ""Lays"" (23.4%), almost without interest for the topic of divinity, since relatively more independent, individualistic and introverted of all; they are also those who sympathize mote with immigrants, with a special curiosity about culture and news; they ate not fearful of life; they travel more and are the only ones to express some interest in politics; they are relatively younger and educated, mote often unmarried and without children.

2545,"Making Your Environment ""The Third Teacher""","The Italian Schools of Reggio Emilia are acclaimed for the stunning environments their educators have created, provoking us to recognize the instructive power of an environment. Their schools vibrantly exemplify learning environments that dazzle the senses, invite curiosity and discovery, and foster strong, respectful relationships. Unlike American early childhood classrooms, their walls are not covered with alphabet letters, calendars, and job charts. American programs have been developing a ""culture of compliance"" aimed at regulations, not dreams for children, and homogenization and institutionalization are spreading widely across the United States. The author of this article argues that it's time that we do some careful reexamination to see how our standards and rating scales have begun to limit our thinking, and how commercial and political interests are shaping more of what we do. She suggests that teachers can create flexible environments that are responsive to the need for children and teachers to construct knowledge together. Her recommendations go beyond merely thinking of a classroom environment as ""home decorating"" with a ""superficial window dressing mindset,"" and instead emphasizes that the environment is itself a powerful teacher. Thinking about the environment as a communicator and shaper of values can stir up anew the significance of early care and education work.

2546,An analysis of scientific epistemological beliefs and learning orientations of Taiwanese eighth graders,"The purpose of this study was to acquire a better understanding of the interaction between scientific epistemological beliefs and learning orientations in a group of Taiwanese eighth graders. After analyzing questionnaire responses of an initial sample of 202 students, 20 information-rich students were selected as the final subjects for this study; A qualitative analysis through interviewing of the subjects revealed that students holding constructivist epistemological beliefs about science (knowledge constructivists) tended to learn through constructivist-oriented instructional activities, and employ a more active manner as well as more meaningful strategies when learning science, whereas students having epistemological beliefs, more aligned with empiricism (knowledge empiricists), tended to use more rote-like strategies to enhance their understanding. Knowledge constructivist subjects tended to have more pragmatic views about the value of science and they were mainly motivated by their interest and curiosity about science, whereas knowledge empiricist subjects were mainly motivated by performance on examinations. This article suggests the importance of presenting the constructivist philosophy of science for students. It follows that students are expected to have more meaningful orientations, as well as more appropriate attitudes, toward learning science.

2548,Positioning strategies for animal-friendly products: A social dilemma approach,"Many consumers express concerns about the welfare of animals in agriculture, but often refrain from purchasing animal-friendly alternatives that address their concerns. To support consumers in making choices in line with their values and attitudes, this study approaches consumer animal-friendly product choice as a dilemma between maximizing the buyer's self-interest and maximizing societal interest. To address this social dilemma, we developed and tested positioning strategies that reinforce the animal welfare label with complementary consumption values (functional, emotional, social, and epistemic). The results from a choice experiment with Dutch chicken meat shoppers showed that two strategies-emotional and epistemic-effectively increase consumer value perceptions. These insights imply that animal-friendly products positioned to invoke emotion or curiosity drive consumers towards animal-friendly product choices, and that these strategies are most effective for consumers who base their choice solely on maximizing either self-interest or societal interest.

2550,William T. Stearn Prize 2014: The perfect pest: Natural history and the red squirrel in nineteenth-century Scotland,"Following the extirpation of the red squirrel from much of Scotland by the end of the eighteenth century, nineteenth-century naturalists strived to find evidence of its native Scottish status. As medieval accounts and Gaelic place names proved ambiguous, the true extent of the squirrel's former habitat was a matter of some debate. While numerous reintroductions of the species were made from the late eighteenth century, general enthusiasm for the return of the squirrel quickly turned to dismay, ultimately followed by persecution. If the squirrel originally represented a symbolic mission to rediscover a lost species, the physical animal itself fell below expectations. It became publically perceived as both economically and ecologically destructive. The squirrel was despised by foresters and landowners for damaging trees, while naturalists condemned the species for the destruction of bird's eggs and nests. This article will investigate naturalists' quests to rediscover the red squirrel, before examining changing attitudes to the species upon its reintroduction and gradual proliferation. The narrative will emerge through the works and correspondence of Scottish naturalist John Alexander Harvie-Brown (1844-1916) and The new statistical account of Scotland (1834-1845). The argument will be made that the red squirrel as an object of antiquarian curiosity initially made the species endearing to natural historians, as part of a wider fascination with extinct British fauna. However, the clash between naturalists' established ornithological interests did little to endear the species to that community, leaving the red squirrel open to a policy of general persecution on economic grounds. <c2><a9> The Society for the History of Natural History.","Holmes, M",0,10.3366/anh.2015.0284,1815
2551,Transforming neuroscience education in psychiatry,"The article discusses about transforming neuroscience education in psychiatry. In considering the articles assembled in this special issue of Academic Psychiatry and the motivations for creating it, one must reflect on the current state of the relationship between neuroscience and psychiatry. Psychiatric disorders are inherently brain disorders, and neuroscience is the basic science of psychiatry. Although most psychiatrists entered this profession because of their curiosity about the mind and a fascination with its workings, as well as a desire to alleviate suffering, they did not do so because of an interest in neuroscience per se. Therefore, the interest of psychiatrists in neuroscience is likely to be driven primarily by practical clinical implications. As illustrated in this issue, a number of creative and talented educators in academic psychiatry departments are currently teaching neuroscience and coordinating courses or curricula using a variety of organizing principles and pedagogical approaches. The authors hope that these represent only the beginning of experimentation and innovation in this domain and that by our assembling these examples in this issue, their efforts can be modeled or disseminated more widely.

2554,VALUES THAT PROMOTES THE PEDAGOGICAL ROBOTICS MODEL,"The pedagogical robotics model is a project that seeks to provide answers and alternatives to the educational model in Mexico. Stepping out of the traditional model of memorization and proposing a model that promotes the following key features. Learn by Doing, working in a teamwork framework, with creativity and doing it in a fun way. An important ingredient in the model is maintaining the student interest for improving himself, this is achieved through competitions or tournaments in which the student must demonstrate his acquired knowledge and skills competing against other student teams. The pedagogical robotics model seeks to impact on technology development in Mexico by promoting and encouraging children and youth of Mexico to find the taste and like applied mathematics and physics. The model creates an impact on the development of Mexico, in the first instance allows the opportunity for children and young people to have an interest in applied mathematics and physics. This will result in a greater number of students being involved in learning spaces in these areas, which would facilitate them to create mental models and structures to identify, analyze, combine, understand and develop skills of critical thinking. In addition the project will allow a greater number of students entering the engineering and technology areas, where the skills developed through pedagogical robotics would help them create their own knowledge. This knowledge generated in their practice of constructivism gives them the confidence to create new objects and technological breakthrough that can be patented. Eventually achieving an impact on Mexico's technological development. The pedagogical robotics model promotes a set of values associated with each of the main features that make the model. In the part of constructivism where students learn by doing they do so working with enthusiasm and efficiency, listening actively to their surroundings and teammates, working with perseverance to achieve their goals. The proposed Learning space requires teamwork where each and every one of the members must demonstrate commitment, tolerance and responsibility in doing their work, recognizing that the world in which we have to live, it is very important to do their work and arrive to work on time and always express gratitude and respect for their teammates, because we can improve and we are what we are, thanks to the people with whom we interact. Creativity is a skill and also a very important value in the model, which promotes the values of curiosity and imagination in a context of simplicity and ongoing critique of the world around them and the models they construct to represent the different mechanisms and robots. Besides all that, work is presented in a fun way, in a context of friendship, joy and play, where the study done with all these features makes that students achieved levels of learning, comprehension and retention greater than 75% in the Learning Pyramid. Finally the model promotes students to prepare for tournaments or competitions and compete with patience, honesty, courteous and recognizing the result of their acts with humility.","Lamadrid Alvarez, A and Pastrana Palma, A and Valencia Perez L.

2560,What motivates the online news browser? News item selection in a social information seeking scenario,"Introduction. We investigated how online news consumers select content in an explicitly social scenario using uses and gratification theory (UGT). Method. Participants (n=30) browsed an online news Website and selected three items. In a post-task interview, participants rated articles on interest, intellectual curiosity, and likelihood to share, and articulated their motivations for choosing each item. Analysis. The article (n=90) was the unit of analysis. Structured content analysis of the interview data involved classifying motivations according to UGT's categories of surveillance, social utility, personal identity, entertainment, and habit. We quantitatively examined interest, intellectual curiosity and willingness to share ratings. Results. Participants employed different strategies in selecting content. The prospect of making conversation influenced many participants to select content with broad appeal, and some made use of social features of the news Website to accomplish this. Surveillance and social utility motivations dominated selections; entertainment was a minor consideration. However, more personal considerations such as interest, a desire to keep up to date with world events, and alignment with point of view played an important role in selecting content.Conclusions. When seeking information to share with others, personal interest and curiosity play an important role in selection, but a wide range of situational factors and goals also come into play. Participants articulated nuanced considerations of how information could be used to forge connections with others, construct social interactions, and make an impression on others. Information seeking as a means of satisfying social needs is an area ripe for exploration in information behaviour research. <c2><a9> The author, 2014.","O'Brien, H and Freund, L and Westman, S",0,,1822

2562,EMOTIONS OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE USE OF DIGITAL PORTFOLIOS AS A,"The work that is presented here is a part of an innovation project carried out for a teaching team from University of Granada. The main objective of this project was the integration of new strategies of learning and assessment in Higher Education as the e-portfolio in a blended-learning environment. The project was developed for two academic years (from 2012 to 2014), and it was funded by the Vicerectorate for quality assurance of the University of Granada. This paper is focused on one of the issues that has revealed lately as an important key in the learning and teaching processes: the emotional dimension. In order to do this, the emotions that students feel in the production of a digital portfolio in a virtual learning environment, are studied. The objectives are focused in analyzing the emotions that university students show with a didactic strategy based on the use of digital portfolios. The methodological approach used to reach these objectives has been the quantitative perspective. The instrument used for the data collection was a questionnaire elaborated by the team and tested by means of proofs of construct and content validity. The selected sample in this study is formed by 358 students participating in ten different courses of different degrees from the University of Granada. Regarding the main results obtained from the descriptive statistics analysis, we have to highlight more and most varied positives emotions than negative emotions related to online learning. Among the positive emotions, relief and joy are the most experienced by students during the learning activities in virtual environments. On the other hand, the most experienced negative emotions are worry-stress and confusion-disorientation. In this regard, we consider that emotions affect intrinsic motivation for learning, based on interest and curiosity. Emotions also affect extrinsic motivation related to the achievement of positive results (for example, good grades) or the prevention of negative results.","Gamiz-Sanchez, Vanesa-Maria and Crisol-Moya, Emilio and Romero-Lopez, Maria-Asuncion",0,,1824
2563,The influence of treatment team cohesion in the success of in-home mental health treatment for children and adolescents with emotional and behavioral disorders,"Background. The author pursued this area of interest due to having had a positive experience working as a therapist within a high cohesion treatment team in an in-home setting. This experience with a high cohesion team seemed to lead to more successful results than other teams that were deemed low cohesion, in the same format. This experience led to a general curiosity about why the team this author was on was more effective. Additional research allowed this author to determine the possible link between cohesion, success of treatment and reduced risk for burnout, defined as a response to chronic job related stressors (Maslach, 2003). This possible link paved the way for this research to be accomplished. The purpose of this study was to determine if treatment team cohesion is a factor in determining the success of in-home treatment for children and adolescents with emotional and behavioral diagnoses. The link between cohesion and treatment team success has not been specifically researched; however, cohesion has been related to the success of teams in various sports. It was hypothesized that a high cohesion treatment team would result in more successful in-home treatment than a low cohesion treatment team. Methods. A closed record review was completed on 26 participants, with 13 participants in each treatment team. The participants were assigned to a specific team by the Clinical Director of the family preservation services provider based upon the caseload of the clinicians at the time of assignment. The same licensed therapist completed the Work Environment Scale (WES) to determine which team had the higher level of cohesion. Demographic variables of gender, ethnicity, duration of treatment, and medication status were used, along with the CAFAS and GAF scores in two hierarchical linear regression analyses. Two hierarchical linear regressions were performed using SPSS. The first regression utilized the cohesion measure, demographic variables (gender, ethnicity, duration of treatment and medication status), and the initial Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score as independent variables (IVs) to determine the likelihood of prediction of the final GAF score, both individually and combined as a group. The second regression provided the cohesion measure, demographic variables (as listed above) and the initial Child and Adolescent Functional Assessment Scale (CAFAS) score as IVs to determine the likelihood of prediction of the final CAFAS score, both individually and combined as a group. Results. Hierarchical regression analyses did not support the hypothesis; however, the statistical power of the sample size was too low to determine if significant results actually existed. Due to the restraints of managed care, inclusionary and exclusionary restrictions for this particular research and the significant decrease of funding for in-home treatment programs the participants that were appropriate for the purposes of this research unexpectedly resulted in a limited sample size. Conclusions. Results implicated a relationship between the CAFAS scores and the racial background of the participants. While this relationship is unclear the majority of the participants were African American and the clinician completing the CAFAS was Caucasian. Limitations of the study indicate additional research with a larger sample size would be beneficial to determine if there is a relationship between the cohesion of the treatment team and the success of in-home therapy.

Towards the trivialisation of learning and the death of scholarship,"Developments within education, psychology and the neurosciences have shed a great deal of light on how we learn while, at the same time, confirming for us all that learning is a profoundly complex process and far from understood. Against this background, and in this position article, we consider the recent rise in interest in the concept of learning styles as VAK (visual, auditory, kinaesthetic) in primary schools in England and Wales and begin to identify and interrogate some of the more unorthodox claims frequently used to legitimise and lend support to its validity.

2565,Age-related changes in non-cognitive behaviours in a canine model of aging and dementia and therapeutic evaluation of adrafinil and modafinil,"The canine model of human aging and dementia has focused on cognitive aging with limited work on non-cognitive behaviours. The present investigation examined changes in non-cognitive behaviours in dogs as a function of age and cognitive ability. The therapeutic potential of two stimulants, adrafinil and modafinil, were also assessed. Locomotor activity was assessed using the open field test, the home cage test and the Actiwatchreg; system. Age-dependent declines were observed in a familiar situation using both the home cage test and Actiwatch reg; system. Cognitively impaired aged dogs, however, showed increased activity compared to unimpaired dogs. Dogs raised in a laboratory setting were hyperactive compared to dogs raised on a farm. The Actiwatchreg; demonstrated circadian patterns of activity in dogs that varied as a function of age, cognitive status and housing environment. Aged dogs housed in an indoor facility showed a delayed onset of activity and shorter, more fragmented bouts of activity compared to young dogs. Age-related differences were less prominent in dogs housed in an outdoor facility. The human interaction, model dog and silhouette tests assessed social responses. Young dogs displayed more active social responses including climbing and licking. The aged dogs preferred more passive responses such as sitting quietly beside the person. Cognitively impaired dogs exhibited very little interest in the social stimuli. Exploratory behaviour was assessed with the curiosity test. Interest in the toys declined with age with older dogs spending less time playing. Impaired dogs expressed little interest in the toys. Environmentally impoverished dogs showed high levels of interest in the toys independent of cognitive ability. The mirror test most reliably distinguished between cognitively impaired and unimpaired aged dogs. Impaired dogs spent the most time reacting to the reflection compared to other dogs. Adrafinil and modafinil are behavioural stimulants that we studied in aged dogs. Adrafinil most effectively increased locomotion in the novel open field test. Modafinil produced small increases in the open field test. No effect of modafinil was observed in the human interaction, curiosity or mirror tests. The canine model of human aging and dementia can therefore be extended to include non-cognitive behaviours and used to evaluate the therapeutic potential of pharmaceuticals and dietary interventions.

2567,Interactional Practices in Prenatal Care: Balancing a Medical Agenda with Patient Concerns,"Studies examining US prenatal care have identified problem screening and information giving as the doctor<e2><80><99>s main agenda, and receiving information as patients<e2><80><99> main goal, however few studies have examined the interactional practices of prenatal care to determine how physician and patient goals and orientations become manifest in the visit and how they are implemented in practice. This study applies the methods of conversation analysis to 30 prenatal consultations to uncover how patients<e2><80><99> desires, views, and concerns manifest in discussion, and how the doctor navigates the balance between patient concerns and a medical agenda. An analysis of ultrasound introductions shows how the doctor and her patients index a secondary orientation to the ultrasound as a valid means to satisfy patient curiosity, while simultaneously maintaining a primary orientation to the ultrasound as a medical tool. In addition, both parties may exploit patient curiosity as a cover for medical concerns. Examining different points of future decision making reveals that the doctor implicates varying levels of patient agency in determining the course of care. These differing levels of agency appear to vary systematically with the type of decision under discussion, apparently owing to patient experience, professional recommendations, and larger cultural attitudes. Finally, the doctor and patients<e2><80><99> regular use of particular interactional strategies creates an environment in which worry is obscured or circumvented. This allows for the doctor to monitor the patient and share information with her without triggering alarm. Taken together, these chapters help to elucidate how important prenatal care objectives are pursued with due sensitivity to patient interests and concerns.","Kietzer, Lisa Ann",0,,1828

By listening to the concerns and interests of the students and using their input to help fashion a responsive science curriculum, the book shows us how to reconnect students to science. Furthermore, if topics of particular interest to female students are stressed, the book makes the case that it is not only possible to inspire girls to love science, but also to eradicate traditional gender divisions that may keep female students from pursuing careers in science.

2570,"Hope, Hostility, and Interest: What Motivated Teachers to Teach about the Soviet Union after World War II","Historically, the cold war was a watershed that separated two epochs: the time of abnormal, although compelled, partnership of two political systems and the period of peaceful coexistence with barely hidden hostility. The peacefulness of the latter, however elusive and vulnerable it was from time to time, has to be credited to the cold war, a relatively short period of time in world history, when humankind, and most importantly its leaders, realized how close our world was to self-destruction. The purpose of this article is to trace educators' rationale or motivation for teaching about the Soviet Union in the second half of the 1940s through the1950s, and how their motivation changed during that period. It is argued that although there existed a general tendency and interest among social studies teachers to teach about the Soviet Union these motivations and interests were conditioned by different circumstances and, consequently, pursued different goals. People who are in political power in the United States and Russia now belong to the post-World War II generation. They learned about the Soviet Union/Russia and the United States from their parents, from the media, and in school. The analysis of teachers' motivations in this controversial period of the cold war points out a general attitude toward the Soviet Union among many educators. This attitude can be expressed by the following triad: hopeful curiosity; confrontational hostility; and confrontation and interest.","Rapoport, Anatoli",0,,1831

Observations show that elephants, like humans, are concerned with distressed or deceased individuals, and render assistance to the ailing and show a special interest in dead bodies, of their own kind. This paper reports helping and investigative behaviour of different elephants and their families towards a dying and deceased matriarch. We make use of long-term association records, GPS tracking data and direct observations. Records made around the time of death, shows that the helping behaviour and special interest exhibited was not restricted to closely related kin. The case is made that elephants, like human beings, can show compassionate behaviour to others in distress. They have a general awareness and curiosity about death, as these behaviours are directed both towards kin and non-related individuals. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

2577,"DNA Computation: Theory, Practice, and Prospects","L. M. Adleman launched the field of DNA computing with a demonstration in 1994 that strands of DNA could be used to solve the Hamiltonian path problem for a simple graph. He also identified three broad categories of open questions for the field. First, is DNA capable of universal computation? Second, what kinds of algorithms can DNA implement? Third, can the error rates in the manipulations of the DNA be controlled enough to allow for useful computation? In the two years that have followed, theoretical work has shown that DNA is in fact capable of universal computation. Furthermore, algorithms for solving interesting questions, like breaking the Data Encryption Standard, have been described using currently available technology and methods. Finally, a few algorithms have been proposed to handle some of the apparently crippling error rates in a few of the common processes used to manipulate DNA. It is thus unlikely that DNA computation is doomed to be only a passing curiosity. However, much work remains to be done on the containment and correction of errors. It is far from clear if the problems in the error rates can be solved sufficiently to ever allow for general-purpose computation that will challenge the more popular substrates for computation. Unfortunately, biological demonstrations of the theoretical results have been sadly lacking. To date, only the simplest of computations have been carried out in DNA. To make significant progress, the field will require both the assessment of the practicality of the different manipulations of DNA and the implementation of algorithms for realistic problems. Theoreticians, in collaboration with experimentalists, can contribute to this research program by settling on a small set of practical and efficient models for DNA computation.","Maley, Carlo C",0,10.1162/evco.1998.6.3.201,1834

Although Wilson promotes the teaching of science as useful knowledge in its own right, he also recognizes that the way science is taught can encourage audiences to take the subject up and read further on their own. Form, according to Wilson, should not be divorced from scientific content and lecturers should ensure that not only is their science accurate, but that it is presented in a way that will provoke curiosity and stimulate interest. This paper discusses the influence of narrative in structuring scientific objects and phenomena, and considers the consequences of such presentations for historical research.

A list of inventions and technologies can suggest topics for student research. Books about inventions and technologies are plentiful and a good source of information for students. A field trip might be helpful, or students can interview people who are in a position to know so something about a device or process. Teachers can encourage students to make value judgments about the past, present, and future usefulness or importance of an invention or technology. In another activity, teachers can ask students to think of a current need or problem. Having identified the problem, students can brainstorm for a possible invention or technological advancement to solve the problem or meet the need. Inventions and technologies can be grouped and listed three different ways: (1) according to the name of the inventor or scientist; (2) according to the type of invention or technology such as transportation, communication, energy, materials, clothing, building or tools; or (3) chronologically. The document includes a chronological list of some 94 inventions and areas of innovation from 1730 to 1973. The items listed range from the long rifle and Franklin stove to Sputnik and Skylab. Because inventions and technologies are the devices and processes that students see around them every day, the relevancy is obvious. Students have a natural curiosity for how a device or process worked, the life story of the inventor or scientist, or the relationship of one innovation to another. Inventions and technologies are a predictably interesting way to motivate students to study history. (DK)","Beardsley, Donna A",0,,1838
2583,"School, cultural diversity, multiculturalism, and contact","The basic assumption of this paper is that school's potential to improve cross-cultural relations, as well as interpersonal relations in general, is enormous. This assumption is supported by a number of theoretical considerations and by the analysis of data we obtained from a study we conducted on the attitudes toward diversity and multiculturalism of pupils attending Italian schools. Our research findings indicate that both teachers and pupils seldom perceive school as a place that can provide this positive and significant opportunity. Many of the difficulties in pupils' relationships with culturally diverse peers at school coincide with, or are very similar to, the difficulties in their relationships with peers in general, thus supporting the assumption that there are some common basic motivations underlying the acceptance or the rejection of 'the other,' be 'the other' culturally diverse or not. Depending on the cases, cross-cultural relations among pupils at school can be characterized by empathy, curiosity, failed attempts or a dearth of attempts to get to know each other, indifference, resentment, envy, and rejection. Our results are analyzed within a theoretical framework which includes the concept of diversity, contact theory, multicultural ideology, and competitive lifestyles. Teachers' roles in fostering pupils' cross-cultural relations are discussed and several educational interventions aiming to develop acceptance of and interest in diversity, as well as empathy toward outgroup members, are suggested. <c2><a9> 2011 Taylor & Francis.","Pagani, C and Robustelli, F and Martinelli, C",0,10.1080/14675986.2011.617427,1839
2584,Adolescent depression as an antecedent to substance abuse,"This study investigated factors that are linked to the onset of substance abuse in adolescents residing in a low socioeconomic community. Traditionally, several variables have been associated with the onset of illicit substance taking behaviors. Current propositions conclude peer pressure, curiosity, drug availability, sociability, boredom, frustration and low socioeconomic status are culprits in substance abuse. However, this study was conducted to gain insight into whether the stressors faced by adolescents can lead to depression and subsequently to substance abuse. Assessment of depressive and substance abuse symptoms was completed through such qualitative research methods as participant observation, the clinical interview, the structured in-depth interview and the focus group methodology. The participants in this study were nineteen (19) African American male and female adolescents, 12 to 18 years of age (mean age of 14.79), chosen from a disproportionate number of adolescents residing in a public housing community. The researcher concluded that approximately five percent (5%) of the sample population is experiencing a host of depressive symptoms that precipitated the onset of substance use. Approximately twenty-six (26%) of the study participants were manifesting, consistently, such depressive traits as feelings of discouragement, worry, a lack of interest in things, anger, and a fear of hurting others. Other depressive traits diagnosed in respondents consisted of feelings of depression, insomnia, nightmares, fear of hurting themselves, and worthlessness. It was found that these adolescents use illicit substances in an attempt to self medicate their symptoms. Approximately five percent (5%) of the sample openly admitted to using drugs because they are sad, feel like a failure, to have more energy and because they have family problems; while thirty-two (32%) admitted to using illicit substances to feel better about their problems. Data collected on the substance abuse and depression variables indicates that such life stressors as an absent parent from the home, childhood illnesses, family discord, kinship home environments and single parent household adversely impact the lives of adolescents residing in public housing.

Schmid-huber posits that such a drive can explain ``essential aspects of ... curiosity, creativity, art, science, music, [and] jokes'', implying that such phenomena might be replicated in an artificial general intelligence programmed with such a drive. I pose two caveats: 1) as pointed out by Rayhawk, not everything that can be considered ``interesting'' according to this definition is interesting to humans; 2) because of (irrational) hyperbolic discounting of future rewards, humans have an additional preference for rewards that are structured to prevent premature satiation, often superseding intrinsic preferences for compression progress.","Looks, Moshe",0,,1843

Interactive haptic tasks combined with immersive visual display provide a potential solution for attention modulation and training. In this paper, we introduced a visuo-haptic game consisting of stimulus-response tasks using fingertip pressure control with immersive visual display using the Oculus Rift. Users were required to press a force sensor using either the index or middle finger from either hand. In each trial, users needed to maintain a constant force with an expected tolerance within an allowable response time. An adaptive strategy was proposed to tune the difficulty level of the task to match the force control skill of the user, which may produce an optimal success rate in each trial to maintain users' interest and keep them motivated. Furthermore, a randomized algorithm was adopted to vary the target fingertip, target force magnitude and target tolerance between adjacent trials, which was designed to avoid the boring repetition and thus to keep the users' curiosity on the task. Experimental results on six participants show that the proposed strategy was able to obtain different expected success rates, i.e. either 79.4 % or 50 %.","Yang, Xiaoxiao and Wang, Dangxiao and Zhang, Yuru",0,10.1007/978-3-319-42321-0_41,1848

2600,Moving on: Use of Computer Games During Transitional Care for Young People with Long Term Medical Conditions,"Young people with long-term medical conditions eventually have to `transfer' from child to adult care. Transition involves careful planning and preparation for this event. Predictors for successful transition include increasing independence, active involvement in self-care and the ability to independently discuss care with the doctor. However, many young people and their families feel that they are not adequately prepared for transition. They can find it difficult to get information in an appropriate, age-related format. Therefore there is interest in how information can be presented in a youth-friendly way and how technology might support this. We have reviewed the literature for issues that are common to young people with long-term conditions and their needs as they move into adult care. The impact of computer games on healthcare education was also reviewed with findings extrapolated to scenarios where they might be of benefit during transition. Several computer games have been developed and evaluated in young people. Improvements in knowledge, self-efficacy, adherence to treatment and improved communication were reported. However the games were often disease specific meaning that their information cannot be generalised to other long term conditions. Some of the important skills required for transition include self-advocacy, teaching of age appropriate self-management, improved communication skills, understanding the importance of compliance to drug therapies and awareness of potential side effects as well as understanding of and being able to distinguish between similar conditions. Some of the inherent characteristics of games which could promote acquisition of these skills include goals, feedback, rewards, challenges and the ability to invoke curiosity and hence encourage involvement in the care process. We have made recommendations for design features that would allow the creation of games for transitional care which would reinforce appropriate skills and provide a format for delivering important health care information. Caveats are the acceptance of games by the young person, different ages and genders as well as by the clinical team. Therefore it will be very important to include these stakeholders when designing and developing health education games.","Wilson, Andrew and McDonagh, Janet",0,,1850

Using multilevel mixture models to explore individual differences in appraisal structures,"How does personality influence the relationship between appraisals and emotions? Recent research suggests individual differences in appraisal structures: people may differ in an emotion's appraisal pattern. We explored individual differences in interest's appraisal structure, assessed as the within-person covariance of appraisals with interest. People viewed images of abstract visual art and provided ratings of interest and of interest's appraisals (novelty-complexity and coping potential) for each picture. A multilevel mixture model found two between-person classes that reflected distinct within-person appraisal styles. For people in the larger class (68%), the novelty-complexity appraisal had a stronger effect on interest; for people in the smaller class (32%), the coping potential appraisal had a stronger effect. People in the larger class were significantly higher in appetitive traits related to novelty seeking (e.g., sensation seeking, openness to experience, and trait curiosity), suggesting that the appraisal classes have substantive meaning. We conclude by discussing the value of within-person mixture models for the study of personality and appraisal.","Silvia, Paul J and Henson, Robert A and Templin, Jonathan L",0,10.1080/02699930902850528,1851

Children's emotionality and social status: a meta-analytic review. Social Development, 15, 394-417.]. In the present study we extended these findings by examining the emotion of interest and child characteristics (positive emotionality, attention control, and sex) that might moderate relations between negative emotionality and social status. Based on a sample of 154 middle-class, rural, predominantly Caucasian 1st- and 2nd-grade children, individual differences in interest and happiness correlated with children's social status. High levels of negative emotionality (i.e., anger and/or sadness), however, attenuated the otherwise beneficial social effects of interest, happiness, and attention control. Overall, emotionality and attention control accounted for 24% of the variance in peer nominations for being liked. We discuss implications for the promotion of young children's social development.

2603,"Dreams, their mechanism and meaning","Although sleep has not aroused popular interest, and drowsiness has been too little studied, the curiosity concerning dreams has amply compensated for this indifference. Dreams, in the life of primitive men, seem to have been invested with profound significance and to have played a conspicuous part in determining their theories of life, death, religion, medicine, and their crude science of mind and conduct. Naive accounts of the mechanism of dreams were accepted--thus the soul was said to leave the body during sleep and wander about in strange places. Dreams were supposed to represent the fragmentary memory of the adventures of the wandering soul. The main interest, however, was not in the mechanism but rather in the meaning of dreams. The naive mind is always looking for signs, and especially for signs that point forward, into the future. Only the sophisticated man realizes that all signs point backward. So far as signs reveal anything at all, they indicate what has already happened. Only in so far as the future grows out of the past and is determined by the past, can the signs of the present be said to point forward and to be prophetic. We need not dwell on the naive accounts given by the soothsayers and prophets, the oracles and the dream books. There is no known justification for seeking In dreams any occult revelation of hidden mysteries nor of the destinies of men. We must look for the meanings of dreams in their origins and sources. We believe these to be best revealed in the phenomena of drowsiness. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Hollingworth, H L",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/13420-007,1853

Part 2, ""Teaching within Academic Disciplines"" discusses: the role of the disciplines; redefining characteristics of the disciplines; teaching within the disciplines; and learning through transdisciplinary teaching. ""Bridging the Disciplines in College Teaching"" in part 3 examines the adaptation of courses and programs to a transdisciplinary context and reexamines the role of teachers. Several conclusions are offered for debate: (1) the primary role of education is humanizing rather than disciplinary mastery; (2) disciplines are not so distinctive, yet cannot be dealt with in a unitary fashion; (3) effective teaching can be reached only when the characteristics of the disciplines and the complex interrelations among them are recognized; and (4) no one method of teaching is effective for all teachers or all students. Several desirable teacher characteristics are suggested: interest in and respect for individuals, their aspirations, and their potentials; pervasive yet directed curiosity; continuing self-appraisal; able communications and demonstration of ideas; honesty; a sense of humility; and ethics.

2605,Pathological curiosity and absence of ennui in encephalitis epidemica,"Normal psychology has concerned itself almost not at all with the mental bases of curiosity and ennui. Ennui is the unpleasant feeling of the dragging of time, combined with a lack of interest in the immediately present inner and outer situation. In typical cases with pathological curiosity a diagnosis of encephalitic Parkinsonism can be made at an early stage, solely from the disappearance of typical attitudes; and particularly from the uncontrollable propensity of these patients to get themselves into active relationships with their surroundings. Most of these occurrences usually reduce to cases of seizing objects in the environment; an exaggerated wakefulness also appears. As for ennui, the attention of the patient is very much elevated above the level necessary for ordinary positions and actions, and there remains little surplus energy for other activities. The patients seem to external observation inactive and uninterested in the environment, but by reason of their exaggerated attention to position and movement they have a lack of ennui.

2606,Can there be a Catholic approach to the teaching of physics to students in Catholic universities? Some ideas for teachers and students to consider,"We currently live in a high-tech society where portable supercomputers, artificial intelligence, genetic enhancement, etc., are becoming part of our daily life. It can be argued that this steady flow of complex technology is vigorously pushing aside religion and faith in God. Nowadays if a student decides to study physics he/she cannot possibly think of, nor have an interest in philosophy, let alone theology. This limited attitude towards physics is stripping it of its real meaning and purpose. This paper argues that physics is a study that God has put in the hands of humanity to be used in conjunction with philosophy and theology, in order not only to be able to ask big questions about nature and the universe, but also to actively contribute to finding some answers to them. Ideas about a scientific-philosophical-theological approach to teaching physics at the undergraduate level within a Catholic institution are presented and discussed. <c2><a9> 2019, <c2><a9> 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Canetta, E",0,10.1080/19422539.2019.1641050,1856
2607,Planning and navigation as active inference,"This paper introduces an active inference formulation of planning and navigation. It illustrates how the exploitation-exploration dilemma is dissolved by acting to minimise uncertainty (i.e. expected surprise or free energy). We use simulations of a maze problem to illustrate how agents can solve quite complicated problems using context sensitive prior preferences to form subgoals. Our focus is on how epistemic behaviour-driven by novelty and the imperative to reduce uncertainty about the world-contextualises pragmatic or goal-directed behaviour. Using simulations, we illustrate the underlying process theory with synthetic behavioural and electrophysiological responses during exploration of a maze and subsequent navigation to a target location. An interesting phenomenon that emerged from the simulations was a putative distinction between `place cells'-that fire when a subgoal is reached-and `path cells'-that fire until a subgoal is reached.","Kaplan, Raphael and Friston, Karl J",0,10.1007/s00422-018-0753-2,1857

The otis quick scoring mental abilities test, beta test form a and the raven standard progressive matrices were also included to determine if the curiosity measures were distinct from iq. The data for 195 6th grade boys and girls were intercorrelated and subjected to maximum likelihood factor analysis. 2 weak curiosity factors emerged, breadth of interest and depth of interest curiosity. On the whole, the curiosity measures were distinct from intelligence but were also distinct from one another. Differences among the curiosity measures and problems with the concept of unitary constructs are discussed. (french summary) (36 ref.)

McClung Lee's book reviewed here is, with one exception, the least satisfactory product of professional social science concerning Northern Ireland which this reviewer can remember reading. In this book, the author's intention is to, 'clarify the social roles of violence in both its current and historical social contexts'. I can think of no grounds - except, perhaps, curiosity value - to recommend this book to either the serious student of Northern Ireland or those with simply a passing interest. It is to be hoped that it will not command the attention in North America which it clearly seeks. It is neither representative of the quality of social science scholarship on Northern Ireland, nor useful in seeking to understand political violence more generally.

We investigated who enrolled in a class about sexual diversity and what they most wanted to learn. Enrolled students reported increased exposure to issues of homosexuality since entering college, and many had sexual minority friends. At preclass, students were most interested in knowing why people are homosexual, whereas at postclass they were interested in supporting someone coming out. Students left the class with significantly decreased homophobia. We discuss the most effective teaching strategies and additional recommendations for discussing sexual diversity in the classroom.","Waterman, A D and Reid, J D and Garfield, L D and Hoy, S J",0,10.1207/S15328023TOP2801_05,1860
2611,Sex differences in intrinsic reading motivation and emotional reading experience,"This article deals with possible differences in reading involvement between boys and girls. Reading involvement emanates from an intrinsic reading motivation: a need to read for affective gratification. Children may, during reading and in connection with text contact, come in close proximity to emotions of a divergent kind and possibly undergo an emotional experience thereby. In exploratory research into intrinsic reading motivation and emotional reading experience, 3,006 pupils (aged 9-17 yrs) completed a questionnaire. It appeared that girls more frequently referred to motives which led to intentional use of books for affective gratification. Girls used books to find relief from boredom and loneliness, to reduce disagreeable tension and to achieve distraction. During reading, boys as well as girls experienced a variety of emotions such as fun, anger, and sadness. Both groups were equally caught up by euphoric (pleasant) emotions such as amusement. However, girls were more open to the experience of dysphoric (unpleasant) emotions while reading so that they experienced these emotions more frequently than boys. Also ""neutral"" emotions such as interest and curiosity scored higher with girls than boys.

2614,Consciousness as a scientific concept: A philosophy of science perspective,"The source of endless speculation and public curiosity, our scientific quest for the origins of human consciousness has expanded along with the technical capabilities of science itself and remains one of the key topics able to fire public as much as academic interest. Yet many problematic issues, identified in this important new book, remain unresolved. Focusing on a series of methodological difficulties swirling around consciousness research, the contributors to this volume suggest that 'consciousness' is, in tact, not a wholly viable scientific concept. Supporting this 'eliminativist' stance are assessments of the current theories and methods of consciousness science in their own terms, as well as applications of good scientific practice criteria from the philosophy of science. For example, the work identifies the central problem of the misuse of qualitative difference and dissociation paradigms, often deployed to identify measures of consciousness. It also examines the difficulties that attend the wide range of experimental protocols used to operational consciousness-and the implications this has on the findings of integrative approaches across behavioural and neurophysiological research. The work also explores the significant mismatch between the common intuitions about the content of consciousness, that motivate much of the current science, and the actual properties of the neural processes underlying sensory and cognitive phenomena. Even as it makes the negative eliminativist case, the strong empirical grounding in this volume also allows positive characterisations to be made about the products of the current science of consciousness, facilitating a re-identification of target phenomena and valid research questions for the mind sciences.

2618,Propensity to engage in interracial dialogue on race: A descriptive study of participants and contributing factors,"This hermeneutic inquiry examines factors that contribute to the self-selection of participants in interracial dialogue on race and the implications of the findings. This study was conducted within the socio-cultural context of race relations in the United States where the problem of racism has defined the national character, has arguably been the most divisive force in the country's consciousness, and remains its central social problem. Throughout U.S. history, a great deal of national energy has been generated and invested in racially influenced movements followed by efforts to make amends for such movements (e.g., slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, the Civil Rights movement). This study has described American race relations as being characterized by a race obsession-avoidance paradox. This construct captures the dichotomy between the United States' cultural preoccupation with race and the simultaneous reluctance to discuss, frankly and openly, race and racism interracially. The paradox is manifested and perpetuated in the fields of education and professional counseling. Addressing racial issues is critical to educational and therapeutic processes, however, race is typically not addressed by teachers, counselor educators, and therapists due to their discomfort with racial issues. Other factors that compose the socio-cultural context for this inquiry are the changing demographics in the United States, the global economy, and the 'multiculturalization' of the country. All of these factors make interracial dialogue a critical workplace competence and economic necessity. Scholars on race agree that discussion of race is the key to racial healing and is critical to reducing racial prejudice. The intention of this study, then, was to investigate factors that encourage interracial dialogue on race by interviewing twenty purposefully selected individuals who participated in interracial dialogue on race, despite the cultural tendency toward avoidance. Themes that emerged from the data included early curiosity and experience with racism, interracial contact, focus on education, self-reflection, approximating experiences, high levels of empathy, moral and racial identity development and social interest. Implications extrapolated from the findings suggest the potential for intentional educational experiences to have significant impact on attitudes regarding race relations. Recommendations for further study include investigation of the relationship between the themes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Willow, Rebecca A",0,,1864
2619,Making Students More Curious,"A connection between creativity and curiosity may seem self evident, and, indeed, psychologists and philosophers have long held that creativity and curiosity are related. It seems logical enough. One can imagine that the typical individual is satisfied by the usual solution to a problem or the usual way to conceptualize a situation, but the intensely curious individual keeps thinking about it and so might come to a new, creative solution or conceptualization of an old problem. Recent work also shows that curiosity is related to academic performance. In fact, the combination of curiosity and conscientiousness--a feeling of responsibility to get things done--has as big an impact on grades as intelligence (Von Stumm, Hell, and Chamorro-Premuzic 2011). So, there are good reasons to encourage curiosity in students, but what, exactly, are we encouraging? Researchers have had a hard time pinning down a definition of curiosity (Renninger and Hidi 2011) or even a way to think about it that's consistently useful. Is it mostly a matter of thought? Is it an emotional state? Or maybe it should be characterized by what people do when they feel curious. Oftentimes a successful definition is the result of scientific inquiry, not a prerequisite. Therefore, there is a need to start with something provisional. This article offers a characterization that has both cognitive and emotional elements (Silvia 2008). The starting point is the idea that humans enjoy solving problems.","Willingham, Daniel",0,,1865
2624,Changes in the attitudes of Israeli students at the Hebrew University Medical School toward residency in psychiatry: A cohort study,"Introduction: Recruitment of medical students to the field of psychiatry has been on the decline in the western world over the last decades. Trends in students' interest in psychiatry is a topic of research studied by medical educators in many countries. Our aim was to examine changes in the attitudes of Israeli medical students toward different specialties, including psychiatry, over the course of their training. We attempted to identify trends and patterns in these perceptions. Method: A standard validated 26-item questionnaire was administered to 307 medical students during their clinical years at the Hebrew University Medical School in 2003-2004. The response rate of the current survey was 69%. The questionnaire evaluated medical students' opinions and perceptions towards psychiatry, compared with other medical specialties. The results were compared with those found by Abramowitz and Gofrit in 2005 dealing with the same student population during their preclinical studies in 2000-2002. Results: Psychiatry was ranked as the least attractive specialty by the whole population of students in their clinical years (4th-6th year) with an average of 14.9% of students regarding psychiatry as a possible career option; 32.8% of the same cohort considered psychiatry as a specialty during the preclinical years in medical school. Significantly, psychiatry's attractiveness was rated the lowest in many aspects, and most attractive in lifestyle. These opinions showed a marked deterioration from those expressed by the same cohort during the preclinical years. Discussion: Attitudes toward psychiatry at the start of medical school are positive. Thus the potential for recruitment of future psychiatrists among the students is good. However, the present study showed a marked negative change in medical students' perceptions towards psychiatry as a possible career choice during their training. The problematic image of psychiatry as a profession has been documented in several countries. Our findings are similar. In addition, we identify the decline in interest in selecting psychiatry as a possible residency as occurring during the clinical training years. Programs should be targeted to those who show initial curiosity and interest in the workings of the mind and spirit.

2625,"Ready, Set, Read...and Understand!","When reading science texts, students often do not know what they know. Prereading activities can help students build bridges from the known to the unknown. Brainstorming will help students recognize their own prior knowledge on the subject and learn from hearing each other's responses. An anticipation guide is a teacher-generated list of questions that are asked of students before reading the text to elicit thinking, arouse curiosity, and focus attention. Science teachers can use graphic organizers to introduce new technical vocabulary from the unit under investigation and to illustrate the interrelationships that exist among the various concepts and terms. Capitalizing on students' curiosity increases students' motivation to read, which leads to an increase in comprehension. Providing students with a list of terms and having them classify them and identify their reasons for doing so will not only stimulate student interest but will also help the teacher find out what students do and do not know about the topic. Active comprehension on the part of the students can be promoted by asking them to make predictions as to the content of the selection. (MG)","Gray, MaryAnn",0,,1867
2627,Scientists Reflect on Why They Chose to Study Science,"A concern commonly raised in literature and in media relates to the declining proportions of students who enter and remain in the `science pipeline', and whether many countries, including Australia and New Zealand, have enough budding scientists to fill research and industry positions in the coming years. In addition, there is concern that insufficient numbers of students continue in science to ensure an informed, scientifically literate citizenry. The aim of the research presented in this paper was to survey current Australian and New Zealand scientists to explore their reasons for choosing to study science. An online survey was conducted via a link to SurveyGizmo. The data presented are from 726 respondents who answered 22 forced-choice items and an open-ended question about the reasons they chose to study science. The quantitative data were analysed using t tests and analyses of variance followed by Duncan's multiple range tests, and the qualitative data were analysed thematically. The quantitative data showed that the main reasons scientists reported choosing to study science were because they were interested in science and because they were good at science. Secondary school science classes and one particular science teacher also were found to be important factors. Of much less importance were the prestige of science and financial considerations. The qualitative data expanded on these findings and showed that passion for science and/or curiosity about the world were important factors and also highlighted the importance of recreational pursuits, such as camping when a child. In the words of one respondent, `People don't go into science for the money and glory. It's passion for knowledge and science that always attracted me to the field'.","Venville, Grady and Rennie, Leonie and Hanbury, Colin and Longnecker, Nancy",0,10.1007/s11165-013-9352-3,1868

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the interest of young men and women in playing with fire in childhood and as adolescents. Methods. Two interview studies were performed with fifty 18-year-old men and forty-five 18-19-year-old women. Results. The two studies showed that playing with fire is a common phenomenon among children. In the male group, 70% reported playing with fire in childhood, and in the female group, the proportion was 44%. None of the young men played with fire at the age of 18, while 44% of the young women did. In the draftee's study, playing with fire resulted in uncontrollable fires destroying three buildings, one car and a grass wall. There was one uncontrollable fire in the girls' study. The reasons for not playing with fire in childhood were said to be parental exhortation, prohibition, supervision, fear, and respect for fire. The motives for playing with fire in childhood were curiosity and distraction in the male group, and excitement-seeking and amusement in the female group.","Perrin-Wallqvist, R and Norlander, T",0,10.1348/135532503322362933,1869

The model of the research is the exploratory sequential design from mixed research patterns. The appropriate sampling method was used in the research. The qualitative data of the research were collected from 26 students through a semi-structured interview form. Content analysis was used in the analysis of qualitative data. The quantitative data of the research were obtained by a questionnaire developed as an analysis of the qualitative data of the research. 95 students participated in the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used in the analysis of quantitative data In the research, it was understood that the positive attitudes towards the civilization history lesson of the students in the primary school teaching department were caused by curiosity and interest and their negative attitudes were caused by making the students passive and lesson subjects. The civilization history study methods of students are source books, lesson teacher, note-taking, and to work by typing. Reasons of topics which are students easily learn are interest and curiosity, national history and previous information. The reason for the difficulty in learning on some subjects is that there are too many subjects. Interest and curiosity with teaching method and technique are common causes of the success and failure of the students in the civilization history lesson. In addition, students attach great importance to the use of interactive teaching methods and techniques and visual teaching materials in civilization history lesson.","Elban, Mehmet",0,,1870

Isolated Ss were more active in a cross maze, but not in an open field. Several factors which may influence an S's approach to a goal animal include curiosity, playfulness, aggressiveness, and sexual interest. No group of Ss preferred a goal guinea pig in a 4-choice test. Males isolated at weaning meeting another such male were more aggressive than males in isolated-grouped or grouped-grouped encounters but did not make more nonaggressive contacts. Males isolated in adulthood meeting other such males exhibited more nonaggressive behavior but not more fighting. Use of gregariousness as a unitary concept is questioned.

2633,Seeking common ground: Surveying the theoretical and empirical landscapes for curiosity and interest,"AbstractMy purpose in this commentary was to seek out any common ground that might be found for theory and research on curiosity and interest as detailed by the contributors to this special issue. Despite the numerous differences that these authors demarcated, several areas of concurrence were readily identified. Those seven areas are, thus, specified and summarized. This commentary then concludes with the forwarding of three questions intended to provoke curiosity or fuel the interest of those engaged in research on these two complex and challenging constructs and their various manifestations.In framing my commentary to this thought-provoking special issue, Curiosity and Interest: Conceptual Distinctions, Relations, and Implications for Educational Practice, I set out to map the common ground that those investigating curiosity or interest occupied. This is what Wilson (1998) described as a search for consilience or unity of knowledge. Thus, with the mapping of common ground as my goal, I looked for points of agreement in the conceptions, components, procedures, antecedents, and consequences of curiosity and interest as described by the contributing authors. This exploration, indeed, proved fruitful. In what follows, I summarize the emergent principles that form this common ground for curiosity and interest. Then, in keeping with my role as commentator, I conclude with several provocations for contributing authors and others invested in the study of curiosity or interest to weigh. In so doing, I hope to engender their curiosity and fuel their interest.

2635,The Integration of the Arduino Platform in the Physics Lessons,"The results of the research that we performed in Physics education demonstrated that the integration of the Arduino platform in the Physics lessons was an important step in the improvement of the teaching and learning process. The variety of the sensors which can be used with this platform (acceleration, temperature, light, sound, magnetic field sensors etc.) enabled us to perform numerous and interesting experiments in the field of Mechanics, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetism and Optics. In this study we describe the way we performed a series of Arduino-based didactic experiments, such as: the determination of the gravitational acceleration, the measurement of the oscillation period of a pendulum, the study of the charging and discharging of an electric capacitor, the temperature monitoring using a thermistor, the drawing of the characteristic of a photoresistor etc. In order to perform experiments for determining the gravitational acceleration and for measuring the oscillation period of a pendulum, we built up an infrared (IR) barrier using an IR LED as emitter and a IR photoresistor as receiver. The IR barrier was periodically intersected by the suspension wire of the pendulum, its oscillation period being calculated with a high degree of accuracy. Moreover, the free fall of a small rectangular ladder having transparent and opaque areas at equally spaced distances enabled the fairly accurate measurement of the time intervals when the IR beam was obstructed. This way the determination of the gravitational acceleration could be performed with a good level of precision. For the qualitative and quantitative study of the physical processes associated with the charging and discharging of an electrolytic capacitor, we used a simple electric circuit which enabled us to acquire the necessary data for a graphical representation of the charging-discharging cycle of the device. In order to monitor the values of the temperature with a thermistor, we used a voltage divider which could read the variation of the values in the electrical voltage generated at the connecting terminals of the thermistor, according to the variation of the temperature of the physical environment. A similar electric circuit was used for the study of the electrical resistance variation of a photoresistor with the light intensity. These experiments are perfectly in line with the modern and efficient approach to Physics education. This aspect was demonstrated by the rapid processes of data acquisition and processing, coupled with the interpretation of the obtained results. The students involved in the experiments constantly proved to have enthusiasm and curiosity, thereby improving their cognitive capacities and skills in the interdisciplinary area of STEM.","Oprea, Marin",0,10.12753/2066-026X-18-084,1874
2636,"PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS, EXPERIENCES WITH INTERCULTURALISM THROUGH THE","Teachers must always bear in mind that the aim of the school is to enable children to develop language learning (knowledge, attitudes and social representations related to languages and cultures) that will help them to play their role both in society as well as in the academic field, so that they can overcome the difficulties of the environment to be able to communicate with other people, and share cultural references. In order to accomplish it, it is convenient that pre-service teachers know how to do an analysis of the social situation that occurs in schools. In the Faculty of Education and Sport of Vitoria-Gasteiz, it is advocated that university students develop tools for conflict resolution and thus acquire skills that allow them to know how to act in a real classroom with children. For that reason, it is proposed to the students of the 2nd year to work in groups of 4 students. That work consists of the presentation of a case that addresses aspects related to interculturalism and plurilingualism in an elementary classroom. During the reflective and analytical process several doubts and dilemmas will arise (what is coexistence? Could this be defined as the absence of conflict? And what is a conflict? Is it always negative? Is it necessary to intervene in all kinds of conflicts? What kinds of conflicts can be managed from school? Which agents should be involved in the solution of such conflicts?; Can conflicts be prevented? Should the school have a plan of action? What internal, external agents can facilitate coexistence, conflict resolution?) and the students will have: 1 To be able to identify variables, factors and elements involved in the case elaborated, both in the classroom and in the school, through the construction of different hypotheses. 2 To collect information, and, as a result, the possible answers to the hypotheses elaborated to understand the situation raised in the case. 3 To create a digital group portfolio, where information about the individual and group process is presented. This methodology of cooperative learning promotes the autonomy, the curiosity and the active participation of the student since he has to decide what, how and when to study, that is, to set, propose and resolve the case. All this results in the motivation and commitment of the prospective teachers and they also emphasize the functionality of the work and the interest in carrying out the teaching intervention.","Rodriguez-Minambres, Paloma",0,,1875

2638,Perspective of the northern ireland guardian ad litem agency: - making a difference for children,"On 4th November 1996 a new figure was introduced to the child care arena in Northern Ireland. The Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 introduced, along with an overhaul of the legal system affecting children, a Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) with a duty to ascertain the wishes and feelings of the child, to advise the Court of these and to advise what is in the best interests in proceedings affecting that child. In England and Wales a Guardian Ad Litem had existed in Public Law since 1975. The Children Act enhanced and strengthened the role of the GAL but Courts and Social Services were already familiar to the opportunity and challenge presented by the presence of a GAL. While the facility to appoint a GAL existed for many years in England and Wales there has continued to be unease about the administration and funding of the service provided by local authorities and therefore potentially compromising the independence of the GAL from all parties to proceedings (Timms 1997). The Guardian Ad Litem service in England and Wales is currently under review and may in the future be under the same umbrella as the Court Welfare Service and the Official Solicitor. The importance of the decision by the DHSS to set up an independent agency to manage and administer the GAL service in Northern Ireland should not be underestimated. That point has been made time and time again to the Agency by Panel managers from England. It is an unusual but welcome position to be in as the new kid on the block. But there is a willingness among many interested in the GAL role to monitor and learn from our experiences as we have learned from the experiences of others over the years. It is still very early days in the life of a new agency to provide any definitive comment about the legal process and the niche occupied by the GAL. The challenges in this first year have been many and varied. From the planning and managing of a demand-led service to the specific case demands that require GALs to have an amalgamation of expertise in alcohol/ drug/solvent abuse/ physical/ sexual/ emotional abuse and neglect/ mental health/physical and learning disability. No worker could possibly be expert in all of these areas. The challenge for GALs is to draw on and capture the expertise of others not to attempt to usurp the expertise of others with their own. There continues to be excitement and curiosity about the role of the GAL and whether or not it is living up to the promise of being the voice of the child in specified public law proceedings. From an overview of the service it is clear that there are key attributes and processes inherent in the role that provide the opportunity for the GAL to make a difference for children. I will now go on to describe these under the headings of 1) independence 2) representing the child 3) mediation and negotiation and 4) critical appraisal. <c2><a9> 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Donaldson, T",0,10.1080/13575279708413102,1877
2639,Parents as Teachers: Beginning at the Beginning,"Missouri's Parents as Teachers (PAT) program is a state-funded nontargeted early prevention service that is provided by all 543 school districts in the state. Professional educators involved in the program provide parents with the tools they need to effectively teach and nurture their young children. The PAT curriculum was designed to strengthen the foundations of later learning, language and intellectual development, curiosity, and social skills. In 1985, when pilot project participants who were 3 years old were compared with a matched comparison group, results confirmed the benefits of the program to children and their parents. Based on the success of the pilot project, the PAT program has grown significantly with support of state and local funding. Since 1985, professional staff from the pilot project have trained and credentialed 1,500 parent educators to provide PAT services. Statewide expansion has challenged the program to demonstrate its effectiveness in the inner cities, in migrant communities, and with the rural poor throughout the state. Mounting national and international interest in the program suggests that others agree that the best way to improve elementary education is to strengthen parents' role as their children's first teachers.

2641,"Young people's world-mindedness and the global dimension in their geography education: A comparative study of upper secondary school students ideas in Finland, Germany and the Netherlands","Geography is one of the most important school subjects for the development of global awareness and international understanding. Curricular concepts and pedagogical strategies for developing global awareness through geography abound. What is largely unknown, however, is howyoung peoplemake sense of theworld inwhich they are growing up and if this has any relationship with their geography education. In this cross-national research project, we compare students' worldviews and ideas about the global dimension in their geography education in Finland, Germany and the Netherlands. To analyze the students' worldviews, we use a world-mindedness scale as a methodological tool. Despite differences in national contexts, the students from each of the three countries show very similar outcomes. Specifically, the students are open to the world and possess a sense of curiosity, seeking cultural experiences and the opportunity to meet other people and see other places. At the same time, they prioritize their own and national interests over wider global interests, such as sharing welfare and giving up specific rights. These answers do not show much regard for responsibility or solidarity with the world. In regards to their opinions about their own geography education, the students recognize the attention for global issues and themes but have problems identifying the teaching and learning approaches associated with global education. We wonder if their dual position toward theworld should be a perspective that is incorporated into geography education when developing global awareness. <c2><a9> 2013 Taylor & Francis.","B<c3><a9>neker, T and Tani, S and Uphues, R and Van Der Vaart, R",0,10.1080/10382046.2013.826544,1879

However, little is known about the impact of different technology-supported learning activities on student intrinsic motivation or whether such learning activities significantly enhance student intrinsic motivation compared to traditional classroom environments without technological support. In order to investigate the phenomenon of intrinsic motivation in technology-supported learning environments, this paper examines factors that support individual student intrinsic motivation in online discussions. A research model is presented based on research into motivation, and the specific areas of self-determination and curiosity provide a framework for the model. A qualitative research methodology is used to validate the model. Results from the study indicate that five factors; perceived competence, perceived challenge, feedback, perceived interest and perceived curiosity, were strongly supported, with partial support for the construct of perceived choice.

2649,Science and Engineering for Grades 6-12: Investigation and Design at the Center. Consensus Study Report,"It is essential for today's students to learn about science and engineering in order to make sense of the world around them and participate as informed members of a democratic society. The skills and ways of thinking that are developed and honed through engaging in scientific and engineering endeavors can be used to engage with evidence in making personal decisions, to participate responsibly in civic life, and to improve and maintain the health of the environment, as well as to prepare for careers that use science and technology. The majority of Americans learn most of what they know about science and engineering as middle and high school students. During these years of rapid change for students' knowledge, attitudes, and interests, they can be engaged in learning science and engineering through schoolwork that piques their curiosity about the phenomena around them in ways that are relevant to their local surroundings and to their culture. Many decades of education research provide strong evidence for effective practices in teaching and learning of science and engineering. One of the effective practices that helps students learn is to engage in science investigation and engineering design. Broad implementation of science investigation and engineering design and other evidence-based practices in middle and high schools can help address present-day and future national challenges, including broadening access to science and engineering for communities who have traditionally been underrepresented and improving students' educational and life experiences. ""Science and Engineering for Grades 6-12: Investigation and Design at the Center"" revisits ""America's Lab Report: Investigations in High School Science"" in order to consider its discussion of laboratory experiences and teacher and school readiness in an updated context. It considers how to engage today's middle and high school students in doing science and engineering through an analysis of evidence and examples. This report provides guidance for teachers, administrators, creators of instructional resources, and leaders in teacher professional learning on how to support students as they make sense of phenomena, gather and analyze data/information, construct explanations and design solutions, and communicate reasoning to self and others during science investigation and engineering design. It also provides guidance to help educators get started with designing, implementing, and assessing investigation and design.

2650,The Hungarian Hexagon,"In this article, the author reports on the League for the Exchange of Commonwealth Teachers (LECT) study visit to Budapest. The main aims for the visit were as follows: (1) to widen their knowledge of the interactive teaching of mathematics; (2) to gain an insight into how colleagues can develop pupils' curiosity, interest and enthusiasm for mathematics through independent activities, investigations and discussions; (3) to gain an insight into the education system of another country and allow comparison with and reflection upon their own, through discussions with other mathematics specialists from different key stages; and (4) to develop their own self-confidence and self-worth and to develop expertise in the teaching of mathematics. One year past, their planning now also reflects what they saw in Budapest. The initials HS (Hungarian Style) on their plans indicates a short session of whole class teaching-from-the-front with all the children working together and discussing an example or two with the teacher. The children now ask more questions and seek clarification more readily and teachers can address misconceptions before they become entrenched. Furthermore, the author recommends a LECT overseas study visit to any teacher since it is an opportunity to compare and contrast cultures that broadens one's awareness of different teaching strategies and provides opportunities to reflect on good practice.","Palmer, Jackie",0,,1883
2651,Social justice transition of privileged persons: A phenomenological study,"This study explored how and why privileged persons come to engage in social justice activism through their lifeworld experiences including their intuition, cognition, embodiment, consciousness, critical consciousness, material conditions, and social spaces. The privileged are those persons with university education and related advantages such as favorable family and social environment, material security and comfort, anticipation and expectation of higher education. Guided by phenomenology, the research explored the subjective lifeworld experiences of privileged persons to determine what motivated their interest and engagement for social justice of others whose human rights are violated in the world. Thirteen research participants representing the Millennium, Echo, and Baby Boomer generations were selected from Amnesty International (Canada) to explore their lifeworld, retrospectively, in order to capture their entry into social justice consciousness and interest. A gender balance of equal number of males and females was desired but not fully achieved. The interviews captured complex and diverse pathways of how and why privileged persons entered into caring and identifying with those whose human rights are violated in a distant world. The study was motivated by the personal curiosity of the researcher, the lack of data on social justice activists in Canada, and the literature informing the research interest. The literature included the theories of phenomenology, negative dialectics, and critical theory indicating that consciousness is predominantly foundational to critical theory and social actions. The research indicates a connection between Husserlian phenomenology, negative dialectics, and critical theory that is manifested in the lifeworld experiences of privileged participants whose perceptions and consciousness of an unjust world motivated their interests and participation in social justice.

2654,An information security knowledge sharing model in organizations,"Knowledge sharing plays an important role in the domain of information security, due to its positive effect on employees' information security awareness. It is acknowledged that security awareness is the most important factor that mitigates the risk of information security breaches in organizations. In this research, a model has been presented that shows how information security knowledge sharing (ISKS) forms and decreases the risk of information security incidents. The Motivation Theory and Theory of Planned Behavior besides Triandis model were applied as the theoretical backbone of the conceptual framework. The results of the data analysis showed that earning a reputation, and gaining promotion as an extrinsic motivation and curiosity satisfaction as an intrinsic motivation have positive effects on employees' attitude toward ISKS. However, self-worth satisfaction does not influence ISKS attitude. In addition, the findings revealed that attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms have positive effects on ISKS intention and ISKS intention affects ISKS behavior. The outcomes also showed that organizational support influences ISKS behavior more than trust. The results of this research should be of interest to academics and practitioners in the domain of information security. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As they begin telling their story, I attempt to listen intentionally to their words, their subjective experiences, observing their body and my own, noticing what emerges in the space that Is playing out between us. I notice the feelings in the silences as much as the emotions that emerge with, and are implied by, the words; being an empathic witness to their stories. For so long I only focused on the physical, feeling the emotions hang in the room like a heavy curtain, unsure of how to acknowledge their presence or recognize their Importance. Now I am comfortable with integrating language, emotions and experiences, exploring the potential connections between the body and mind.

2657,A study of the relationship between conservation education and scuba diver behavior in the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary,"Scuba diver impacts on coral reefs are causing many threats to reefs. One solution is to change divers<e2><80><99> behaviors through on-site environmental education. The Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary developed an education program in an effort to achieve this goal. The purpose of this study was to describe the education program, understand how it affected divers<e2><80><99> knowledge of and value orientation toward coral reefs, and examine two teaching approaches conducted in a recreation/tourism setting. Two theories were tested in this study. Orams<e2><80><99> model was used to develop the <e2><80><9c>Naturalist Onboard<e2><80><9d> program and describe how the model played out in a diver education situation. The work Bransford<e2><80><99>s team did was tested to see how their teaching approach works in a recreation/tourism setting. Evaluating this program was achieved through pre- and post-questionnaires, participant observation and semi-structured interviews. They were used in the first article to provide a description of how Orams<e2><80><99> model played out in the real world. In the second article they were used to determine: (1) the value orientation of the divers, (2) how much knowledge divers gained via participation in this program, (3) the relationship between value orientation and knowledge gained, and (4) the degree their value orientations affect knowledge acquisition. In the final article they were used to see how two teaching approaches affected divers<e2><80><99> knowledge and value orientations about coral reefs, and how the divers responded to the two approaches. The program aroused divers<e2><80><99> curiosity, engaged their emotions, and motivated them to minimize their impacts while visiting the coral reef. However, suggestions for making changes in their behavior at home were not received well. Most divers had a <e2><80><9c>biocentric<e2><80><9d> value orientation and gained a significant amount of knowledge. These divers were also more open to learning and changing their behaviors. There was no significant difference between the two approaches regarding the divers<e2><80><99> knowledge and value orientation. This may be due to validity threats. Due to time constraints and divers<e2><80><99> lack of interest in actively acquiring knowledge, the constructivist teaching approach did not work well in this setting.","Belknap, Julia",0,,1887

This paper makes two contributions towards its practical deployment: 1) We generalize the combinatorial requirement on the schedules and show that the solution is a cover-free family. As a result, a much wider number and variety of constructions for schedules exist to match network conditions. 2) In simulation, we closely match the theoretical bound on expected throughput. The bound was derived assuming acknowledgments are available immediately. We use rateless forward error correction (RFEC) as an acknowledgment scheme with mini mal computational overhead. Since the wireless medium is inherently unreliable, RFEC also offers some measure of automatic adaptation to channel load. These contributions renew interest in topology-transparent scheduling when delay is a principal objective.","Syrotiuk, Violet R and Colbourn, Charles J and Yellamraju, Sruthi",0,10.1109/TNET.2007.899018,1888
2659,"The aesthetic experience with visual art ""at first glance""","The aesthetic experience with visual art has been shown to occur in two stages. Upon initial exposure to a painting, a viewer spontaneously generates a global impression, or gist, of the work. One's first impression of a painting includes a sense of its pictorial content, overall structural organization and style, meaningfulness, and an affective reaction to it. When gist information in a painting is deemed to have sufficient interest lo an observer, the second stage of aesthetic processing ensues. This consists of directed focal exploration of the image to expand knowledge concerning the work's compositional features and organization to satisfy cognitive curiosity and lo develop aesthetic appreciation of a composition. This chapter presents an overview of research findings that have identified the types of visual properties and semantically related information that collectively lead lo the activation of what is labeled a ""painting gist"" by this author In addition, the influence of the painting gist response on the focal exploration of paintings is discussed.

2660,Psychometric Properties of the Parent Attitude toward Children's Expressiveness Scale (PACES),"The Parent Attitude toward Children's Expressiveness Scale (PACES) provides a measure of the degree of acceptance-control the respondent allows toward a child's hypothetical emotional and expressive behavior. PACES is a 20-item scale with a multiple choice format for each item. Emotional and expressive behaviors represented in PACES include anger, distress or sadness, fear, anxiety or nervousness, interest or curiosity, happiness or pleasure, and disgust. Some accepting responses are of a sympathetic or empathic sort, while others are more suggestive of permissiveness. Some of the most controlling reactions border on humiliating or ridiculing the child, while others are more indicative of a scolding response. The instrument appears to be a reliable instrument for assessing the degree of control in a parent's attitude toward children's emotional and expressive behavior. The scale appears to have good construct validity as an attitude measure that evaluates the degree to which parents believe children ought to control their displays of emotional and expressive behavior. Past and ongoing research with the scale is reviewed. It is concluded that PACES provides numerous possibilities for investigating a variety of questions in the area of emotional development, family systems, and socialization.

According to the authors the term 'research' in teacher research should be reserved for forms of systematic and intentional behavior to collect and analyze data on specific practices that results in a better understanding of these practices and, in the writing up of the research, imparts meaning beyond the local context. Criticizing the hegemony of effectiveness studies (what works?) in the educational research agenda, they secondly discuss a broader interpretation of research in terms of understanding and insight, genuine interest and curiosity as legitimate elements in an educational research. Finally, they argue for a sustained collaboration between teachers and trained researchers as the best guarantee for relevant and valuable teacher research.

These days, students rarely ask where did that product come from or how is it are made? Post secondary students have lost their curiosity. However, this does not begin with the students, this begins with the educators - it beings with the teachers, their knowledge, resources and tools. The classroom is only as good as the person standing at the front. Through CAPSULE, we are trying to restore that inquiry and motivation to explore ideas, regardless of the practicality. Engineering is all about try, try and try again. It is about teamwork, hands on learning and understanding the work behind the pair of sneakers kids are wearing or the newest iPod to hit the market. The theory and tools behind product innovation is what CAPSULE is trying to bring to America's high schools - to teach and engage teachers using 3D modeling, the engineering design process and implementing project based learning using these tools and according to specific processes. <c2><a9> 2011 IEEE.","Chin, J and Zeid, A and Duggan, C and Kamarthi, S",0,10.1109/ISECon.2011.6229624,1905

Real learning is not driven by the requirements of the school curriculum but by innate curiosity and often by sheer confusion. Good teaching is driven not by proving answers but by asking questions: Asking students to explore, to investigate, to communicate and to reflect. Technology can be used as a resource to facilitate this process but not in the way it is currently being used. The focus needs to move away from content delivery to exploration and investigation. Children should be allowed to explore their own interests and not be bound by the artificial requirements of schools. Helping students should be our aim in schools and universities, we should help them to learn what they want to learn not what educational authorities think they should learn or need to learn. <c2><a9> 2020 selection and editorial matter, Javier Calvo de Mora and Kerry J.

2686,Fostering Creativity and Curiosity: Developing Safer Elementary STEM Learning Spaces,"Recent education initiatives have created a spotlight for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs within schools with an eye to not only improve students' overall performance in mathematics and science, but also increase the pipeline of students pursuing STEM-focused careers. While current STEM initiatives focus on all levels of education, Dejarnette (2012) identifies elementary grades as a key target to foster curiosity in STEM subject areas, allowing for continued interest and learning among students. Unfortunately, the majority of STEM programs in K-12 schools are designed for--and delivered to--secondary students. This means elementary schools that understand the need for STEM learning are building their STEM programs without guidance or access to proven templates. When considering the development of a new STEM lab or space conducive for project-based learning (PBL), many elementary school leaders throughout the nation seem to be looking for assistance and guidance (Kelso, 2010). Despite the benefits of PBL and integrated STEM, it is common for elementary teachers to feel apprehensive about teaching STEM lessons, often making them reluctant to initiate or lead a STEM initiative within their classroom. This reluctance typically involves concerns about classroom management, control over learning activities, and their perceived inability to answer students' questions. These fears may be mitigated or eliminated should the school develop a designated STEM lab or space for all teachers to use within the school.","Swagerty, Lindsey M and Hodge, Tara",0,,1907

He believed that social work could be greatly enriched by literature and the arts and by what the humanities had to teach, and he constantly reminded us of the need to balance our scientific and humanistic projects. He was and will continue to be a source of great inspiration to many, for through his passion for writing he has left us many wonderful books, scholarly articles and essays. Through his wisdom he enriched the social work landscape. He lifted our minds and our souls and made us appreciate the complexities of the human condition that only artists could truly understand. <e2><80><98>The social worker as a performing artist has the talent and will to move beyond the constraints of method and technique and respond imaginatively and creatively to the impromptu, unrehearsed nature of the special human relationship<e2><80><99> (Goldstein, 1998b: 250).

2692,Demystifying continuous participation in game applications at social networking sites: A social playfulness design perspective,"Purpose Drawn from the social playfulness literature and the elaboration likelihood model, the purpose of this paper is to propose and test a research model to examine users' continuous participation in SNS game applications. Design/methodology/approach A field survey with 133 subjects was conducted to test the research model. Findings Two identified design features, symbolic physicality and inherent sociability, are found to influence users' perceived curiosity and perceived enjoyment toward playing SNS game applications. Perceived enjoyment is significantly associated with perceived curiosity and predicts users' continuous participation of SNS game applications. The authors also observed a gender difference of social playfulness design on perceived curiosity. Research limitations/implications Use intention was used as a proxy for actual use behavior, since objective data on continuance behavior was not available. Additionally, the contributions of this study may be constrained by one single sample. Practical implications The findings of the study suggest practical guidelines for designing game applications in SNS through socialization design and symbolic physicality. Further, based on the findings of gender differences, a personalization game design strategy is provided. Originality/value The study contributes to the post-adoption IS literature and sheds light on the interesting area of social media participation. Additionally, this study enriches the online gaming research by demonstrating gender differences.","Wu, Yi and Cui, Tingru and Liu, Na and Deng, Yimeng and Guo, Junpeng",0,10.1108/IntR-11-2016-0347,1911
2693,Reasons for electronic cigarette experimentation and discontinuation among adolescents and young adults,"Introduction: Understanding why young people try and stop electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is critical to inform e-cigarette regulatory efforts. Methods: We conducted 18 focus groups (N = 127) in 1 middle school (MS), 2 high schools (HSs), and 2 colleges in Connecticut to assess themes related to e-cigarette experimentation and discontinuation. We then conducted surveys to evaluate these identified themes in 2 MSs, 4 HSs, and 1 college (N = 1,175) to explore whether reasons for e-cigarette experimentation and/or discontinuation differed by school level or cigarette smoking status. Results: From the focus groups, we identified experimentation themes (i.e., curiosity, flavors, family/ peer influence, easy access, and perceptions of e-cigarettes as ""cool"" and as a healthier/better alternative to cigarettes) and discontinuation themes (i.e., health concerns, loss of interest, high cost, bad taste, and view of e-cigarettes as less satisfying than cigarettes). The survey data showed that the top reasons for experimentation were curiosity (54.4%), appealing flavors (43.8%), and peer influences (31.6%), and the top reasons for discontinuation were responses related to losing interest (23.6%), perceiving e-cigarettes as ""uncool"" (16.3%), and health concerns (12.1%). Cigarette smokers tried e-cigarettes because of the perceptions that they can be used anywhere and to quit smoking and discontinued because they were not as satisfying as cigarettes. School level differences were detected. Conclusions: E-cigarette prevention efforts toward youth should include limiting e-cigarette flavors, communicating messages emphasizing the health risks of use, and changing social norms surrounding the use of e-cigarettes. The results should be interpreted in light of the limitations of this study.

2695,A PROPOSAL OF A METHODOLOGY IN RESEARCH FOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS:,"The topic developed in this project is the result of an experience in the fourth year of Compulsory Secondary Education. The introduction to the methodology of research for students of compulsory education is vital in education. In order to interest students in this discipline, we have sought out a subject that allows us to study different subject areas and find it close and inviting. The Project about the study of socarrat (a ceramic technology from the Valencian seventeenth century) was proposed by the teacher and quickly accepted by the student team. The reasons that led us to investigate this topic have been: The curiosity to discover what the curious name of the title concealed. Socarrat in Valencian means ``scorched'' The possibility of developing such a broad topic in different academic areas: Chemical, Historical, Artistic, Technological ... The ability to investigate, to schedule tasks and learn how to present written work, learning new vocabulary and expressions. Relate the geographical and historical, physical and chemical properties of materials, and artistic representations of Valencia. Develop a team effort with which we have felt very integrated and we have learnet to work in groups taking responsibility as a group and as individuals. The phases of the methodology followed in this experience have been: Previous introduction about the topic. Bibliographical research in libraries and online. Visiting a museum of Ceramics. Decision-making of the aspects to be developed. Distribution of tasks for each participant. Holading fortnightly meetings. At this stage we decide the points that will be dealt with the project and how. Searching and selecting images of ancient socarrats. Socarrats sketches and redesigns Studying the technique of modelling clay. Mixing the clay. Shaping of ceramic pieces. Drying and decorating with redesigns of socarrats Firing in an electric kiln.

2696,Sports in children's picture books,"From an early age, it is very important to encourage children to enjoy sports and to make sports. The awareness and habits gained in the early years of life affect life in the following years. Illustrated children's books are important for early childhood children to gain interest, curiosity and awareness towards an area. Sports and sports-specific elements are among the habits that should be given to children at a young age. The aim of this study is to determine the sport elements in the children's books. For this purpose, the research was designed with a case study pattern of qualitative research approaches. Criterion sampling technique was used in the study. Thirty books with 3-6 years old child development characteristics and the subject of which are direct sports are included in the study group. Document analysis technique was used in data analysis. In the research, it has been determined that books related to different sports branches, sports materials are depicted, sports-specific concepts are mentioned and technical and tactical information is presented. In the sections where sporting competitions take place, are depicted such as fairness / fair competition, fairness, benevolence and ability to tolerate winning-loss values. The processing of sports in illustrated children's books will be effective in the positive attitudes of children in this age of development towards sports. <c2><a9> 2019 by authors, all rights reserved.","Yilmaz, A and Pala, <c5><9e>",0,10.13189/ujer.2019.070324,1914
2698,Bribes or Rewards,"Small tangible rewards for student progress, such as candy bars, pens, or ribbons, add potency to the verbal and written praise offered by the teacher, thus increasing student motivation. Giving students small prizes enhances the cooperative atmosphere of learning, especially for those who do not normally do well. Research indicates that low student motivation, passivity, and lack of parental interest are key problems in American education. Students often feel discouraged about their abilities to compete academically with their peers, and see little connection between school curricula and future employment. In middle schools, motivation begins to move from an intrinsic desire and curiosity to an extrinsic hope of achieving external reward, inhibiting motivation. Numerous examples illustrate how motivational prizes or ""bribes"" effectively induce student motivation. Undoubtedly, there are also shortcomings in the repeated use of extrinsic rewards. But a sample of 25 anonymous student comments about the practice of rewarding them extrinsically were overwhelmingly positive. Until it can be shown that the practice is immoral or educationally unhealthy, the practice of giving rewards and treats can be recommended among English teachers. (HB)","Megyeri, Kathy A",0,,1915

Robert Collins, a science educator in the Faculty of Education, University of Strathclyde, thinks people are ""secret science superstars"" and reminds one to celebrate the teachers who quietly sustain children's motivation to learn science. Ian Milne talks to children themselves in order to explain why science should still be part of the primary school curriculum. Keira Sewell stresses the part played by science in children's critical thinking and their ability to engage in debates about what will be possible in future. Mick Dunne emphasises the significance of asking ""Why?"", even before children recognise it as science, and that every good question leads to two more. Peter McAlister wonders about the limitations of seeing science as a subject in the primary school, and prefers involving children in a ""venture"" that involves thought-provoking enquiry. Natasha Serret explains how wanting to be an astronaut at the age of 10 led to a passion for science. Sarah Earle stresses that to teach science to young children is about helping them to use their natural curiosity in an increasingly systematic way. Tara Lievesley sees that working in science with children helps her remain a ""37-year-old child"". Richard Watkins stresses the importance for children of an emphasis on the big ideas and big names of science. Liz Lakin wonders about that bumble bee on the ceiling, and how it helps children ask and explore difficult questions for which there are no immediate answers.

2700,Ideal versus school learning: Analyzing Israeli secondary school students' conceptions of learning,"This study explored 130 secondary school students' conceptions of learning using an open-ended task, analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Students' reality of learning comprised two separate spheres, ideal learning and school learning, which rarely interacted. Generally, students commented more about school than ideal learning. Factor analysis of learning conception categories revealed separate ""grand"" categories for each sphere and some shared ones. Strikingly, students held complex, deeper conceptions of ideal learning (as self-interest/curiosity, understanding, and knowledge acquisition), but these were separate from their conceptions of school learning as merely the minimal, surface compliance necessary to survive the system by ""satisficing"" [Simon, H. A. (1955). A behavioral model of rational choice.

2702,The relationship between identity style and self-regulated learning,"This exploratory study examined the relationship between identity and self-regulated learning (SRL) in a college population. Identity was tested in relation to SRL and supporting learning behaviors in a study strategies course. The Identity Style inventory (ISI) measures identity as a process describing differential cognitive strategies individuals use in approaching or avoiding pertinent issues. Self-regulated learning (SRL) describes an independent and systematic approach to learning. SRL was measured by the Dynamic Active Learning Inventory (DALI). Dynamic learning refers to unintentional learning such as curiosity and self-reflection. Active learning describes deliberate and proactive use of cognitive strategies such as organization and elaboration. Self-efficacy and Metacognition were also tested for their association to identity style, measured both by the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). Self-efficacy describes student beliefs about performing learning tasks at a certain level. Metacognition involves decision-making strategies about learning. Other learning variables that were tested for their relationship to identity are Motivation, Test anxiety, student Attitude and Interest and Time Management which were all measured by the Learning & Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI). Results of the findings indicate that distinct identity styles were related to Dynamic and Active learning. The data also revealed that student Attitude and interest, Motivation, and Self-efficacy related to identity style. Educational implications are discussed in terms of this study's findings.

This study aimed to explore the reasons why urban Black men with serious injuries chose to participate in clinical research and their concerns about research participation. Methods This qualitative study was conducted within the context of a larger study focused on psychological effects of serious injury in urban Black men; 83 Black men with serious injuries were recruited while hospitalized in an urban trauma center. Informed consent was obtained. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in participants<e2><80><99> homes three months after discharge from the hospital and were audiotaped, transcribed, and de-identified. Thematic content analysis was used to identify themes about perceptions of participating in clinical research. Results The mean age of our sample was 38.2 years, and the mean injury severity score was 10.7 (SD 9.6). The majority (53.2%) of injuries was due to interpersonal violence, and 47% were due to unintentional mechanisms. Eight reasons for research participation emerged from the data: human connection, altruism/community, self-improvement, compensation, gaining knowledge, curiosity/interest, low risk, and reciprocity. Conclusions A major finding was that injured urban Black men participated in clinical research for the opportunity for human and therapeutic connection. Despite some expressions of mistrust, participants were willing to participate for altruistic reasons rooted in community priorities, and as part of their recovery process post-injury. <c2><a9> W.

Comparisons by country,gender, and age were conducted. Children made many similar responses across countries. Predicted differences suggesting greater academic interests and perceived competence among children from Korea and Japan and social interests among children from japan were only partially supported. In many cases, the responses of American and Korean children were most alike. American children generally had the highest perceived competence. Interest in words and numbers but not ideas declined with age across countries. Gender differences were common and often stronger than differences between countries or ages. Across countries, boys showed more interest and perceived competence for numbers and things, whereas girls showed more interest and perceived competence for words.","Henderson, B B and Marx, M H and Kim, Y C",0,10.1177/0022022199030001002,1920

2710,Why and How Africa Should Invest in African Languages and Multilingual Education: An Evidence- and Practice-Based Policy Advocacy Brief,"In the 21st century, learning is at the heart of the modern world's endeavours to become a knowledge economy. It is the key to empowering individuals to be today's world producers and consumers of knowledge. It is essential in enabling people to become critical citizens and to attain self-fulfilment. It is a driver of economic competitiveness as well as community development. Good quality learning is not only about becoming more competent, polyvalent and productive but also about nurturing diversity and being well rooted in one's culture and traditions, while adapting to the unknown and being able to live with others. This kind of learning entails developing curiosity and responsible risk-taking. This advocacy brief seeks to show the pivotal role of languages in achieving such learning. It aims in particular to dispel prejudice and confusion about African languages, and exposes the often hidden attempt to discredit them as being an obstacle to learning. It draws on research and practice to argue what kind of language policy in education would be most appropriate for Africa. This advocacy brief is a short collection of what we know and what research tells us about the use of African languages in education. It is a collection and review of relevant evidence and arguments to inform African decision-makers in their difficult policy choices when it comes to the use of African languages in education and governance. Their choice is made more complex still by the fact that two key stakeholders--namely parents and teachers--have an ill-informed understanding of the issue and tend to oppose it, arguing the need to preserve and protect the supreme interest of the children. Language policy is a political decision, and political decisions should always serve the best and highest interests of the community or nation. In this regard, the advocacy brief also addresses bilateral and multilateral agencies in order to inform their decision-making when working with African governments and alert them to the consequences of their actions and poor advice. This guide will explore research evidence that will spell out the strong prejudices, confusions and threats surrounding the language question. It hopes to show that there is a real intrinsic value and worth to mother-tongue-based education beyond the emotional attachment and loyalty to identity, culture and values. Appended are: (1) Policy guide for the integration of African languages and cultures into the education system (2010); (2) African policy documents; (3) African institutions; (4) Multilingual/bilingual education programmes in Africa and (5) Glossary of technical terms.

2714,A Qualitative Study of Motivation to Read for Pleasure with Adolescent Struggling Readers Using a Theoretical Model: How to Begin?,"A mixed method study explored a theoretical model that employed, combined, and added to the theories of self-determination, the reading engagement perspective, and the four-phase model of interest to motivate adolescent struggling readers to read for pleasure. The model adds to the existing body of research because it specifies an instructional starting point focusing on the powerful intrinsic motivation to read constructs of curiosity, involvement, and interest. Three teachers at different schools implemented the model with 18 students. The results and implementation varied with each teacher. Initially, students responded with an increased motivation to read for pleasure. From there, success varied with the remaining phases. Teachers had limited success with the second phase of the four-phase model of interest development. One teacher aptly maintained interest, one was unsuccessful, and the last teacher maintained interest with motivated students and led the others to more titles. All encountered difficulties when motivation to read waned. All teachers also encountered obstacles and implemented methods to restart pleasure reading. Two teachers had limited knowledge of young adult literature which affected motivation to read for pleasure. Throughout the study positive social interaction patterns positively affected students' motivations to read.

2716,Adolescent sexual development,"One of the most important phases of the adolescent's major problem of achieving independent status is his ability to work out satisfactory relationships with the opposite sex. The solution of this problem depends on the social direction given the powerful physiological drives welling up within him at this time. The sections of this chapter address the following topics: Hormonal Rebalance; The Female Sex Rhythm; Physiological Processes; Psychomotor Performance; Emotional Reactivity; Sex Desire; Autoeroticism; Incidence; Cultural Determinants; Personality Correlates; Consequences; Bisexuality; Homosexuality; Incidence; The Role of Biology; Social Factors; Motivation; Heterosexuality; Psychosexual Growth; Personality Correlates; Cultural Norms; The Assumption of Social Sex Roles; Feminine Roles; Masculine Roles; Sex Education; Education for Social Sex Role; Casual Sex Impressions; Systematic Sex Instruction. As for the subject matter of sex instruction, the progressive approach would demand that it too be adapted to the individual's changing interests and capacities (M. M. Bolles, 1941). Precocious education in this field as in any other is ineffectual if not harmful. During early childhood curiosity centers around the origin of babies and genital sex differences. A little later the child's interest becomes directed toward his mother's body and the process of pregnancy. It is not until he is nine or ten years old that he becomes concerned with the less obvious role of the father in reproduction (J. H. Conn [1940], K. W. Hattendorf [1932]). In adolescence, the main questions concern problems of marriage and family life, techniques of intercourse, birth control, and ways of handling the sex drive (R. W. Beebe [1936], F. I. Davenport [1923], L. M. Drummond [1942]). If sex education could thus meet the individual at each stage of development, it would be able not only to correct the many fallacies prevalent even among the educated today but to develop wholesome attitudes that would contribute importantly to later adjustment (E. V. Pullias [1937], G. Watson and G. Green [1932]). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Seward, Georgene H",0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/11417-012,1924

2719,Introduction: The enduring relevance of international political realism,"Serious intellectuals in the 1940s and 1950s were compelled by international events to reexamine their understanding of the nature of man and his social institutions. Existing theories of the human condition-especially the dominant, optimistic liberal tradition in America-seemed woefully incapable of explaining World War I (which cost 20 million lives), the rise of German fascism and World War II (which killed roughly 70 million people), and the onset of the Cold War with the totalitarian Soviet Union (a conflict which, in the shadow of nuclear weapons, threatened to annihilate mankind). It is not surprising that political realism, with its tragic view of man's drive for power and the inevitability of conflict among states, would blossom in this environment. Less obvious is why many scholars who were instrumental in developing the realist approach, including European secular Jewish <c3><a9>migr<c3><a9>s such as Hans Morgenthau, would find a hospitable home for some of their seminal work in The Review of Politics, a new, Catholic opinion journal based at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. To be sure, the Review had emerged as a leading journal of politics and political theory soon after its first issue was published in 1939, and the founding editor, Waldemar Gurian, himself an <c3><a9>migr<c3><a9> well known in European circles, had a brilliant mind, intellectual curiosity, and an exceptional personality, qualities that attracted innovative thinkers from extraordinarily diverse backgrounds and disciplines.1 Moreover, the leadership at Notre Dame (notably under Father Theodore Hesburgh) genuinely encouraged free and open inquiry into both political and religious matters, welcoming contributions from Catholic, non-Catholic, and nonreligious authors alike But the main reason why the Review emerged as one of the most influential sources of commentary about the origins of international conflict and war was the shared intellectual orientation of the journal's contributors. Four core tenets united this diverse group of prominent thinkers: (1) an obligation to confront the big and difficult questions about international politics; (2) a recognition of the fundamentally tragic nature of relations among humans and states; (3) a rejection of historical optimism and its persistent belief in the perfectibility of man through religious purification, scientific progress, or any other rationalist project; and (4) a belief in practical morality-that is, a deep commitment to moral political action despite the inherent complexity and constraints of the world and the inevitable limitations of human knowledge and reason. This set of core concerns, beliefs, and values stood in stark contrast to the prevailing approaches of the mid-twentieth century. Despite or because of the horrors of global war, political scientists were focusing on increasingly trivial matters, while American society remained mostly wedded to a liberal progressive vision that called for the eradication of selfishness, ignorance, and evil from domestic and international politics. Through the mechanism of right reasoning and carefully designed institutions, power politics would (once and for all) be replaced with a more benign, democratic, lawful, and pacific order. The Review's writers offered a less comforting-but also more realistic-Alternative, which recognized that the best one could do in navigating international affairs was to balance the morally desirable with the politically possible. Half a century later, the arguments and advice contained in these essays seem just as relevant for current debates on international politics and American foreign policy. The decade of the 1990s-with its plethora of international and intra-state conflicts and general foreign policy confusion-undermined the idea, or at least the hope, that the end of the Cold War would be followed by a liberal millennium of democracy, capitalism, and peace. And, of course, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, seemed to obliterate the universalistic beliefs and aspirations of the latest generation of liberal progressive cosmopolitans. Yet many of the same ideas and policies critiqued in the Review decades before are manifest in foreign policy discourse and behavior today. For example, it is difficult to think of a major contemporary international political issue where conflicting participants (states, leaders, groups) do not make political judgments in the name of absolute right and wrong, do not portray their own actions as wholly righteous and those of the other as utterly misguided, if not altogether evil, and do not hold out the prospect of total victory to attract greater support for their cause. In contrast, the Review authors understood that politics itself was defined by the never-ending struggle for power among self-interested actors-not by some kind of contest between the forces of pure good and evil that is resolved in favor of one or the other, depending on the circumstances. Similarly, the Review authors in this volume would have found much to criticize in the way political leaders have responded to the rise of Islamic terrorism. The Review contributors likely would have recognized this force as a serious threat to Western civilization, and been skeptical of any approach that privileged diplomacy, negotiation, and dialogue as the primary means of directly dealing with such a threat. However, U.S. leaders' calls for total strategic and moral victory in a war on terrorism, as well as the use of religious imagery and the Christian faith to defend this central policy objective, would have been seen by these Review authors as counterproductive and even dangerous. Unlike radical Islamic fundamentalists, and contrary to the hyperbolic claims of some critics, the administration of George W. Bush did not back up its ""you are with us or against us"" rhetoric with a murderous crusade to convert the benighted. But the Review contributors would have rightly counseled the need for greater political humility, moderation, and understanding of the many conflicting interests involved in marshalling an international coalition to deal with this global threat. The essays in this volume are drawn almost exclusively from the first two decades of The Review of Politics. Contributing authors include prominent theorists such as Morgenthau and Herbert Butterfield (each setting forth seminal ideas later found in Politics among Nations and History and Human Relations, respectively), commentators such as Waldemar Gurian and Kenneth Thompson, and policy practitioners such as George Kennan and Paul Nitze, as well as other like-minded and prominent European <c3><a9>migr<c3><a9>s such as Hannah Arendt and Stefan Possony. Together, these works exemplify the core postwar roots of what we now know as the realist tradition and demonstrate the enduring relevance of realist insights for contemporary international relations scholarship and foreign affairs. <c2><a9> 2009 by University of Notre Dame Press.

2720,Reading: The law of satisfaction and individual differences,"Learning to read may be made satisfying by appealing to such impulses as imitativeness, curiosity, mastery, rivalry, the desire for approval, and action. After one has learned to read, there is no impulse, either native or acquired, to which an appeal may not be made by reading. Probably the most effective method of making reading satisfying is to select materials that appeal to the reader's interest.

2721,Our not-so-hidden shame: Lack of ethnic diversity in the field of psychoanalysis,"""Look-I open my 'store' every day. I will serve anyone who comes in. If they don't come in, they don't get served-period. I'm not turning anyone away. It's their choice not to come. I will not go begging."" At a recent psychoanalytic conference, the topic of racial and ethnic diversity was argued and debated. One psychologist participant referred to his practice in the manner quoted above. His words rang m my ears all the way home. The sense of fullfilled responsibility and the rather tepid welcome candidly expressed a position even many liberal-minded members of the profession appear to maintain. Interest in exploring such attitudes and seeking open dialogue about them had motivated me to prepare that conference paper in the first place. I felt some hesitation, not being a person of colour, never having spoken to the issue before, and with nothing particular on my curriculum vitae to back me up. There was and still remains, however, a sense of urgency. While the subject of race and ethnic diversity is politically sensitive and highly charged, the time is long overdue for psychoanalysts to confront the vague uneasiness we feel-perhaps embarrassment-whenever it is raised. Responses like the one above confirm that it behoves us to approach the subject with curiosity and humility, and approach it we must even if we tend to feel more comfortable if it does not come up at at all. Looking back on the conference that prompted this chapter, and the man who said his store is always open, it is clear we have work to do. We must reach out to those who will not set foot in the place even though the store is well stocked and eager for business. Our storekeeper must understand that while the door looks open to him, it may still appear closed and uninviting to many others. We need new storekeepers with greater sensitivity to the demands of a broadened, invigorated clientele. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","O'Leary, John V",0,,1929

2723,Development of an observational quantitative temperament test in three common parrot species,"Although temperament has been studied in a wide range of animal species such as primates, dog or a rodents, it has not yet been well documented in birds and in particular in psittacids. Since parrots possess developed communicative and cognitive skills, the study of personality traits is of particular interest. The aim of our study was to develop a reliable and valid temperament test by measuring quantitative behavioural parameters in two genera of medium-sized parrots: the African Grey Parrot (Psittacus erithacus, n = 15) and the Amazon parrot (Amazona spp., n = 16). We selected a set of 26 behavioural parameters based on a high intra-observer reliability. A principal component analysis was used to establish two reliable and valid temperament traits: anxiety/ vigilance and curiosity/neophilia. Our test meets 5 out of 6 reliability and validity criteria which could be assessed. The two identified traits might be related to those found in other animal species, i.e. neuroticism and extraversion. These traits allowed us to demonstrate differences in the temperament of two species from two different genera: Blue-Fronted Amazon Parrots were significantly more anxious/vigilant and more curious/ neophilic than African Grey Parrots. We found that parrots were more curious/neophilic when the test was repeated after six weeks, suggesting that a brief exposure to the experimental conditions resulted in a process of habituation. However, a further test eighteen months after the initial test revealed a high consistency in the two temperament traits. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an objective observational temperament test applied on two parrot species in order to compare their temperament. We believe that comparison of different avian species' temperament using similar testing procedures opens an interesting avenue of research which could be used to link temperament, phylogenetic and ecological data.","Coutant, Thomas and Bagur, Sophie and Gilbert, Caroline",0,10.1016/j.applanim.2018.01.007,1931
2724,Why We Read Wikipedia,"Wikipedia is one of the most popular sites on the Web, with millions of users relying on it to satisfy a broad range of information needs every day. Although it is crucial to understand what exactly these needs are in order to be able to meet them, little is currently known about why users visit Wikipedia. The goal of this paper is to fill this gap by combining a survey of Wikipedia readers with a log-based analysis of user activity. Based on an initial series of user surveys, we build a taxonomy of Wikipedia use cases along several dimensions, capturing users' motivations to visit Wikipedia, the depth of knowledge they are seeking, and their knowledge of the topic of interest prior to visiting Wikipedia. Then, we quantify the prevalence of these use cases via a large-scale user survey conducted on live Wikipedia with almost 30,000 responses. Our analyses highlight the variety of factors driving users to Wikipedia, such as current events, media coverage of a topic, personal curiosity, work or school assignments, or boredom. Finally, we match survey responses to the respondents' digital traces in Wikipedia's server logs, enabling the discovery of behavioral patterns associated with specific use cases. For instance, we observe long and fast-paced page sequences across topics for users who are bored or exploring randomly, whereas those using Wikipedia for work or school spend more time on individual articles focused on topics such as science. Our findings advance our understanding of reader motivations and behavior on Wikipedia and can have implications for developers aiming to improve Wikipedia's user experience, editors striving to cater to their readers' needs, third-party services (such as search engines) providing access to Wikipedia content, and researchers aiming to build tools such as recommendation engines.","Singer, Philipp and Lemmerich, Florian and West, Robert and Zia Leila and and Wulczyn, Ellery and Strohmaier, Markus and Leskovec, Jure",0,10.1145/3038912.3052716,1932
2726,LEARNING THROUGH GAMES: FINANCIAL LITERACY SIMULATION,"Arousing the learner's curiosity and sustaining the interest in learning is a challenge that the 21st century teacher face when designing instructional programmes enriched with the use of ICT (information and communication technologies). To enhance the effectiveness of learning and to evaluate the learning process, harnessing ICT has its benefits. Concept-based games or serious games offers the opportunity to incorporate and contextualized game play to provide an authentic environment for learning. Real-life experiences provide invaluable experience to reinforce learning but such opportunities are not always available and if so, may be too expensive or painful a lesson in life. An alternative is found in simulation games which offer an exciting solution to mirror such authentic scenarios for learning to take place. In recent years, a wide range of commercial simulation games targeted at children have been launched and some do feature high fidelity interactive simulations based upon real-life business principles and practices. In the wake of the recent events in the financial industry, the need to equip our children with this important life skill has taken out from the back burner. Studies consistently demonstrate that many people lack even the basic financial skills needed to provide security for themselves and their families and thrive in today's fast-paced global financial services environment. This paper investigates the use of simulation games as an evidence-based model of using games as a pedagogical tool.","Koh, N K",0,,1933
2727,Passions: What emotions really are,"In this chapter the author explains: First: the responses that we call emotions are responses by the entire person. That is, the responses engage a large number of processes that occur more or less simultaneously, that interact and sustain each other, together forming the action or reaction. They manifest a synchronization of component processes (Scherer, 2005), in that the components are tuned to each other. In a reaction called ""fear,"" for instance, not only does the body move away, and bend so as to diminish its vulnerability. Respiration change also occurs: it supplies oxygen for flight. Autonomic activity is enhanced in support. Thoughts arise: ""Away!"" Attention is focused: ""Away from there!"" Perception is focused upon the threat and on what it may inflict. Second: the response exerts control precedence. The response as a whole, in its growth as well as in its execution, takes control over acting and attending. While doing so, it overrides other claims for action or attention, which tend to be neglected. The responses we call ""emotions"" often involve changes in control and changes in priorities for acting. That is in fact where the word passion comes from. They feel as states that one is overcome by: one is passive in their regard. In the past, such responses were interpreted as inspired by spirits or demons, or as sicknesses of the soul. Third: There are responses that consist of actions that establish or modify a relationship between the person and some object. The actions are ""about"" something. They are ""towards"" or ""away"" from something, or they are ""between"" the person and that something else. A stance is taken towards the object. That is what all component processes together appear to contribute to. As a whole, one goes towards or away from that object. One is open for, or shuts off from. The actions are to or for or with some object, that may on occasion be oneself, as they are in self-love and self-loathing. The third striking aspect of many behaviors is that they manifest people's engagement with the world. And, fourth, particularly striking is the phenomenon that often engagement seeks in some way or other to enhance or weaken the relationship to or the engagement with its object. It combines with people professing feelings of pleasure or displeasure. Pleasure or displeasure is not an aspect of all engagement. Some engagement merely consists of taking an interest in what happens: watching, knowing, understanding, which can be manifest emotions like interest, surprise, wonder, curiosity, fascination: the non-hedonic emotions. Others are hedonically complex or unspecified: being moved, awe, and nostalgia are examples. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Frijda, Nico H",0,,1934

2729,Assessing the Development of Preschoolers. ERIC Digest,"To help parents address those aspects of their child's development which may need special encouragement, support, or intervention, this digest delineates 11 categories of behavior for assessment. Parents should not be alarmed if their children are having difficulty in only a few categories, and they should not judge their children's permanent behavior based on 1 day's observation. The categories are: (1) sleeping habits; (2) eating habits; (3) toilet habits; (4) range of emotions; (5) friendship; (6) variations in play; (7) responses to authority; (8) curiosity; (9) interest; (10) spontaneous affection; and (11) enjoyment of the ""good things in life."" Concerning these categories, parents should ask whether their child usually falls asleep easily and wakes up rested; eats with appetite; has bowel and bladder control, especially during the day; shows the capacity for a range of emotions over a period of time; initiates and maintains satisfying relationships with peers; varies his or her play and adds different elements to the play; accepts adult authority; exhibits curiosity and adventure; becomes absorbed and interested in something outside him- or herself; expresses spontaneous affection for caregivers; and enjoys the pleasures of childhood. The first 3 of the 11 categories are particularly sensitive indicators of children's well-being because the child has control of them. The other criteria are more culture-bound. When children are having problems with some of these areas of development, they can sometimes be helped when adults simply spend more time with them, or when the children's daily routines are simplified.

2730,The Power of Common Interest for Motivating Writers: A Case Study,"Andrea, a doctoral student in education, has a demanding schedule. She has a young child, a job, a house on the market, and a spouse who travels so much that she can only see him on certain weekends. To cope with these unavoidable distractions to her research, she found the writing center and was paired with a fellow graduate student, Charisse. Meeting with Charisse gave Andrea the opportunity to move ahead when she may have otherwise been at a standstill with her writing. In turn, Charisse supported Andrea and helped her manage her research at a time when it seemed nearly impossible. In order to draw attention to the role of motivation in tutoring, this article shows how Charisse's interest in Andrea and in her research served as a powerful motivating force by helping to move Andrea from a focus on external pressures to a place of intrinsic motivation where she could express excitement for her writing and research. As a case study, this research is limited in scope, but seeks to explain why a tutor's interest--that is, deep curiosity in a writer's work--is so important in writing center tutoring.

2733,Introduction: Art and curiosity in Northern Europe,"The essay in this issue are all concerned with a particular realm of experience that early modem Europeans defined as the <e2><80><98>curious.<e2><80><99> In this setting curiosity was not only an impulse, but it was also a state of mind and a condition of the emotions cultivated by those set on investigating the full scope of natural and human invention. Importantly for our purposes, curiosity also represented a sympathy of interest that brought artists together with natural historians in a quest to understand the world by discovering and recording it. At points, curiosity led to an exploration of the exotic and at points to a rediscovery of the mundane. In both instances the motives of these curious seekers betray a pattern of gradual secularization in art and natural philosophy at a critical stage in the evolution of European thought. The curious frame of mind was an agitated and unstable universe, a place where conventional categories of understanding became blurred in the pursuit of material fact. It was a stage in which the prospect of possessing knowledge, of undertaking discovery for its own sake, propelled the investigations of artists and naturalists alike. <c2><a9> 1995 Taylor and Francis Ltd.","Parshall, P",0,10.1080/02666286.1995.10435924,1940

Program participants completed the Scale of Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Motivation in the Classroom (Harter, 1982) and the Self-Perception Profile for Children (Harter, 1982) during the initial week of the program and again upon completion of the program. Pretest and posttest means from three subscales, Preference for Challenge, Incentive to Satisfy Curiosity, and Scholastic Competence, were analyzed using a t-test for paired samples. In addition, 12 students and 14 teachers were interviewed to identify effective program methods and practices that would contribute to motivation and competence. Teachers were asked what techniques they used to challenge students, stimulate curiosity, and foster competence. In order to determine challenging program practices, students were asked whether or not they worked harder and learned more in the program than in regular school, and, if so, why. To determine practices that stimulated curiosity, students were asked if the program was more interesting than regular school, and in what way it was more interesting. To determine practices that enhance self-perceived competence, students were asked whether or not they learned more, and if so, why. The responses to the interviews were compared with findings from the effective schools literature regarding suggested practices for enhancing intrinsic motivation and fostering self-perceived competence. The comparison of pre- and posttest scores on the Preference for Challenge subscale of the instrument measuring motivation showed students moving slightly in the direction toward intrinsic motivation, although the difference was not statistically significant. For the Incentive to Satisfy Curiosity/Interest subscale of the instrument, there was no significant difference in pre- and posttest means.

2739,Two-mode models of self-regulation and serotonergic functioning: Divergent manifestations of impulse and constraint,"The term <e2><80><9c>self-regulation<e2><80><9d> sometimes is used to refer to the process of carrying out an intended behavior by monitoring its consequences to keep it on track (Carver & Scheier, 1998). Sometimes it is used more narrowly to refer to exerting self-control when under the pressure of competing demands (Vohs & Baumeister, 2011). It will be used in both ways in various parts of this chapter. The three of us have been interested in manifestations of self-regulation for some time. One of us is a personality psychologist (CSC); the others are clinical psychologists, with particular interest in mood disorders. This chapter derives from our developing curiosity about a self-regulatory puzzle in personality psychology, which quite unexpectedly led us to different puzzles in neurobiology and genetics, and eventually turned to issues in clinical psychology. The focus of this chapter is on issues of impulse or reactivity versus constraint or deliberative control of action. This distinction is a key aspect of self-regulation. We begin by describing two psychological views on it. We then turn to evidence that serotonergic function helps to promote constraint. In that context we also give some attention to how this system might operate to constrain rather different forms of impulses. More specifically, we consider the idea that serotonergically innervated areas of the brain help modulate the effects of both over-activity and under-activity of underlying systems for approach and avoidance. This idea helps to explain how serotonergic deficits could be involved in a broad set of problems, ranging from antisocial behavior to depression. <c2><a9> Cambridge University Press 2013.","Carver, C S and Johnson, S L and Joormann, J",0,10.1017/CBO9781139152198.018,1946

2743,Cricket Behavior: Observing Insects to Learn about Science & Scientific Inquiry,"Biology teachers know how important it is for them and for their students to engage first-hand with nature. Ideally, bringing students to fields, woodlands, and wetlands to observe, explore, and wonder is the best way to stimulate curiosity and practice scientific inquiry. However, for many reasons, field excursions are not always practical or possible. When they are not, it is often effective to bring familiar living organisms into the classroom, thereby placing students in a context that makes the familiar strange. Students have probably already informally observed some behavior of the patterns of crickets and they may have wondered about the sounds they make during the night. Although they may have listened to crickets, they probably have never actually watched them ""sing."" In the classroom, where these insects can be conveniently observed, students can take time to carefully notice in new ways how crickets behave. Students learn not only a lot about these particular insects but they also learn about scientific reasoning and habits of mind as they practice original scientific inquiry as described in the National Standards. In this article, the author describes cricket behavior investigations and experiments that he used to introduce his students to biology. They require very little equipment and can be used in any school setting from grades 5-12. Although this study requires no sophisticated equipment, it does take some imagination, ingenuity, and class time.

The collaboration is a response to mandated curriculum that emphasizes instruction in basic skills at the expense of content knowledge acquisition. It is designed to demonstrate ways of embedding instruction in the basic skills of reading and writing into the content of science and social studies curriculum. Participants in the collaboration report that they have gained a deeper understanding of theoretical concepts, learned how to embed skills instruction into meaning-rich curriculum, and come to understand importance of curriculum and instruction that build on children's knowledge and interests, their language strengths, and their curiosity. <c2><a9> 2010, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Freidus, H",0,10.1080/1547688X.2010.10399600,1951

The term itself is problematic, and furthermore, there is no agreement in scientific literature about its categorization, as a result of a historical lack of interest that this type of publication has aroused in the academic world.

Ramachandran and by Eugene d'Aquili and Andrew Newberg have sparked considerable curiosity and debate over the reality and basis of religious experience. This article puts such research into a broader context and examines the extent to which scientific research supports or undermines particular religious and theological claims. I argue that such experiments show that religious experience has some biological basis and is not simply a product of cultural suggestion. At the same time, such experiences are not completely self-interpreting, so that cultural context, including theological claims, are needed to make sense of such experiences. By itself, scientific research does not prove or disprove the reality of religious experiences generally, but it does shape how we think of the possibilities and interpretations of such experiences. <c2><a9> 2002 by the Joint Publication Board of Zygon.","Peterson, G R",0,10.1111/0591-2385.00426,1954
2749,FLIPPED CLASSROOM: AN EXPERIENCE OF INNOVATION IN THE UNIVERSITY,"Nowadays, it is accepted that the knowledge society is plural, global, digital and HIPERTEXTUAL. The appearance of the Internet and the digital world has generated a radical change on how to access and transmit knowledge. Learning has stopped being an internal and individual activity, as Siemens points out (2005), to be a collective activity. Scholars, such as Moraros, Islam, Yu, Banow and Schindelka (2015), have contributed to the field by carrying out specific research on innovation and teaching (Valero 2011). Further, they have provided evidence that indicate that the real innovation in the classroom depends on the methodological design made by the teacher or the teaching team. In this sense, does the university training need a change about the conception of the teaching? Will this change modify the central role of teachers in the formative process? Today, students are to become the main actor of their own learning process. Therefore, it is necessary to implement models that encourage curiosity, creativity, and knowledge outside the classroom, which ultimately results into developing character and autonomy when learning (Abeysekera and Dawson, 2014). From that perspective, the following groups have participated in different training programs: the EDO-UdL group, the subgroup EDO research group of Organizational Development and the students of the Master of Child Psychology and Degree of Physiotherapy of the University of Lleida in Spain. The results from the participation have identified certain elements that helped establishing the basis for the design, implementation and evaluation of the transfer of a training model in university education. The paper explains the application of the experience at the University of Lleida during the academic year 2014-2015. The general aim is to offer evidences about the model, specifically in: to know the opinion of students whether the methodology improves learning and teaching processes; to analyze his satisfaction in the development of the subject; to know the academic performance and to identify the opinion of the lecturer. The method used was an evaluative study and data was collected through three instruments: the official university survey, a questionnaire developed and validated for this research, and a focus group and their academic marks. The results show an enrichment of the teaching-learning process, in aspects of assimilation of concepts, changing role of the teacher and students, improve of processes of participation and communication, integration of ICT and interest by the subject.","Flores, Oscar and Del Arco, Isabel and Camats, Ramon and Silva, Patricia",0,,1955

Interest is defined as ""the voluntary application of a skill."" The model depicts an assumed progression from biological triggering represented by attention to personal selection represented by interest in which humans develop idiosyncratic, consummatory-like involvements with their environment that are independent of survival demands. Attention to an environmental anomaly may trigger curiosity. A sustained and persistent attempt to resolve curiosity leads to the development of skills, and these skills then can be applied to solve problems.

2753,SHIFTING THE LEARNING PARADIGM FROM TEACHER CENTRED TO STUDENT CENTRED:,"This paper considers the educational basis of student centered learning on industrial/educational (I/E) links on Applied Business Projects (ABPs). It connects problem based learning (PBL) with three learning outcomes, cognitive learning outcomes, behavioral learning outcomes, and affective learning outcomes. It also considers some underlying theory on situational interest and cognitively induced experience. Most of the research on problems in PBL revolves around the issue of what makes a good problem in the views of tutors and students. The general message from these studies is that a problem should: (i) be authentic, and realistic; (ii) be adapted to the students' level of prior knowledge; (iii) engage students in discussion; (iv) lead to the identification of appropriate learning issues; (v) stimulate student directed learning, and (vi) be interesting. Of course, a key question concerns how these attributes influence student learning in PBL, such as how problems lead to the identification of appropriate learning issues. It also considers the shift from teacher centred learning. This paper investigates the effectiveness of problems in an MBA course by comparing the learning issues identified by students with those intended by faculty members. The assumption behind this investigation was that an effective problem should lead students to identify the learning issues referred to by the problem designers when they developed the problem. This is further elaborated by the student's interest and desire to find out more about a topic which leads to increased and focused attention to solve the problem. Underlying theory, especially proposed by Loewenstien which identified the psychological process in which humans seem to have a natural tendency to make sense of the world, this can be described as situational interest, this term implies that it is not stable or dispositional interest, but the interest is aroused by the problem at hand. This phenomenon has been referred to as cognitively induced experience of (knowledge) deprivation. This experience of deprivation initiates information-seeking behavior intended to close the knowledge gap (i.e. learning occurs). As the knowledge gap closes, through the assimilation of new information into existing knowledge structures, situational interest decreases until the knowledge equilibrium is re-established.","Juskiw, Peter",0,,1957
2754,Informal Youth Violence,"The authors distinguish between formal and informal violence, while stating that informal violence has not been researched so far. This paper deals with this form of violence. The first issue arising in the process of informal violence research is that there are no adequate or theoretically developed elaborations of this phenomenon. Firstly, the authors define informal violence, and after that they present how they developed the instrument VIF - Violence, informal forms. After factorisation and calibration of the instrument, resulting measurement characteristics of this instrument were very high; for example, internal consistency assessed using the Cronbah's coefficient alpha (alpha = .94) is very high, while the split-half method showed a high correlation (r = .90). The instrument is enclosed in the appendix to this paper. Use of the VIF showed that there are six forms of informal violence: gossip, segregation, media mobbing, humiliation in front of peers, insults via the Internet, and mockery. These are, at the same time, the key components or factors of informal violence, chosen by the authors as a varimex rotation in factor analysis of the principal components of the","Suzic, Nenad and Brankovic, Drago",0,,1958

This computational model that we propose has been integrated into the architecture of a Belief-Desire-Intention artificial agent so that this can autonomously select relevant, interesting information of the (external or internal) environment while ignoring other less relevant information. The advantage is that the agent can communicate only that interesting, selective information to its processing resources (focus of the senses, decision-making, etc.) or to its human owner's processing resources so that these resources can be allocated more effectively. We provide both theoretical and empirical arguments for that computational model.","Macedo, Luis",0,10.1109/ACII.2013.24,1959

2761,Review of Psychology of perception,"Reviews the book, Psychology of Perception by William N. Dember (see record 1961-02984-000). The avowed purpose of the book is to present a representative sample of problems, methods, and findings in perception. The ten chapters deal with topics that range all the way from threshold measurement techniques and visual psychophysics through organization of perception, stimulus context, set, and the role of learning, to problems dear to the heart of the New Look adherent. The final chapter on stimulus change, curiosity, and exploratory behaviour reflects the author's personal interest in this increasingly fashionable area. The book easily earns top marks on two accounts, its organization, and its up-to-date references. The second outstanding strength of the book lies in the fact that approximately one-half of some 200 items referred to in the text date from the last six years or so. Dember's style of writing is clear and his language should not present difficulties to typical undergraduates.

2763,"Moral Distress, Ethical Environment, and the Embedded Ethicist","Interest in understanding the experience of moral distress has steadily gained traction in the 30 years since Jameton first described the phenomenon. This curiosity should be of no surprise, since we now have data documenting the incidence across most caregiver roles and healthcare settings, both in the United States and internationally. The data have also amplified healthcare providers' voices who report that the quality of the ethical environment is pivotal to preventing and containing the adverse effects caused by moral distress. Healthcare providers are asking for a moral space where ethics occurs at the bedside, in real time, applied to real cases. They are asking for ethics expertise to be available as part of the care team during their daily work, when treatment goals must be determined and decisions must be made. They are asking for an embedded ethicist who can help cultivate an ethical environment where formal ethics policy is properly applied to practice. This discussion advocates for an embedded ethics resource model that responds to contemporaneous ethics needs as a strategy to mitigate the effects of moral distress.

2766,Confronting a Paradox: A New Perspective of the Impact of Uncertainty in Suspense,"Suspense is a key narrative issue in terms of emotional gratifications. Reactions in response to this type of entertainment are positively related to enjoyment, having a significant impact on the audience's immersion and suspension of disbelief. Related to computational modeling of this feature, some automatic storytelling systems include limited implementations of suspense management system in their core. In this way, the interest of this subject in the area of creativity has resorted to different definitions from fields as narratology and the film industry, as much as several proposals of its constituent features. Among their characteristics, uncertainty is one of the most discussed in terms of impact and need: while many authors affirm that uncertainty is essential to evoke suspense, others limit or reject its influence. Furthermore, the paradox of suspense reflects the problem of including uncertainty as a component required in suspense creation systems. Due to this need to contrast the effects of the uncertainty in order to compute a general model for automatic storytelling systems, we conducted an experiment measuring suspense experienced by a group of subjects that read a story. While a group of them were told the ending of the story in advance, the members of the other group experimented the same story in chronological order. Both the subjects' reported suspense and their physiological responses are gathered and analyzed. Results provide evidence to conclude that uncertainty affects the emotional response of readers, but independently and in a different form than suspense does. It will help to propose a model in which uncertainty is processed separately as management of the amount of knowledge about the outcome available to the spectator, which acts as a control signal to modulate the input features, but not directly in suspense computing.","Delatorre, Pablo and Leon, Carlos and Salguero, Alberto and Palomo-Duarte, Manuel and Gervas, Pablo",0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01392,1965

Nowadays, there are already teachers who use the History of Mathematics as a strategy to follow in the teaching and learning process. In order to help integrate History of Mathematics in a form of non-formal education, we proposed in ``Ciencia Viva'' project - Science in the Holidays for Young People 2015 - to introduce Fibonacci sequence in part of the Summer School of Mathematics of the University of Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro. We have proposed interlinked tasks among themselves that involved the biography of Fibonacci, the sequence with the same name, their basic properties and its applications. In the experience developed with project participants, it was considered the task as a working set of proposals presented to the students and the whole activity of these proposals. In the activities, tasks were diverse, from tasks using the technology, through tasks involving students in the use of paper and pencil and manipulative didactic materials. Thus, there is provided a different approach to many issues of curriculum areas. First the students researched on the internet about the life and work of Fibonacci, following the various tasks. A large number of interesting curiosities and applications of these numbers to mathematical, physical, biological and engineering sciences are included. It also contains a wide variety of material accessible to college and even high school mathematics students and teachers at all levels. With the proposed tasks to the students of secondary school, we believe had contributed to establish connections between History of Mathematics and different mathematical topics, as well as, other areas of knowledge. This project was carried out in a collaborative environment in which students took an active role and culminated with the construction of a poster illustrating the investigated theme.","Catarino, Paula and Vasco, Paulo and Campos, Helena",0,,1966
2771,Inventing a solution and studying a worked solution prepare differently for learning from direct instruction,"Solving an open problem as proposed by inventing and productive failure approaches has been shown to prepare learners effectively for subsequent direct instruction. Inventing can raise awareness of knowledge gaps (cognitive) as well as increase curiosity about and interest in the learning contents (motivational effects). However, studying the problem with a worked solution can have different cognitive and motivational advantages. In two experiments in quite different domains and settings (N-1 = 42; N-2 = 40), we tested to what extent working on an open problem (inventing) as opposed to studying a worked solution of the same problem better prepares (1) student teachers for learning-strategy evaluation, and (2) 8th-graders for learning about ratios in physics. Transfer was better supported by a worked solution. Mediators were the (self-regulated) learning time on most relevant learning contents (Experiment 1) and self-efficacy (Experiment 2). Inventing, however, increased knowledge-gap experience as well as (in Experiment 1) interest and curiosity. The stable transfer effect in two different domains and settings raises interesting questions for further research that had not been systematically investigated so far. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2772,Is simplicity the key to engagement for children on the autism spectrum?,"This article presents a conceptualisation of technologies as simple, ambient forms. By avoiding the tendency to solve problems and by being open to interaction that emerges through repetition and flow, we argue that technology can offer more for people than functionality. When the user is given freedom to discover control without burdensome cognitive demands and the fear of failure, even everyday technologies can arouse curiosity and thus reveal untapped ability. What is unique about our work is its therapeutic application as a medium for engaging the most hard to reach children on the autism spectrum. Our theoretical foundations are drawn from the human-computer interaction paradigm of tangible interaction. This is of interest to us as a framework for the study of the physical and sensory manipulation of information. For children with cognitive and developmental delays, discovering a close match between physical control and digital response has proved both rewarding and motivating. The significance of this is illustrated through a range of studies undertaken with children with autism spectrum disorders. These include a mixed group attending a holiday club, a study that introduced keyboard activities to children with poor receptive communication and a case study using an ordinary microphone. The research captures emergent, exploratory interaction with a software application called ReacTickles. The case study uses a specifically customised video coding technique to analyse idiosyncratic interactions that demonstrate the impact of simple, playful interaction on self-esteem and creativity.","Keay-Bright, Wendy and Howarth, Imogen",0,10.1007/s00779-011-0381-5,1968

Hindu image-worship lies at the core of what counts for Hinduism - up-front and subject to much curiosity and misunderstanding, yet it is a defining feature of this phenomenon. This book focuses on Hindu images and their worship with special reference to Vai<e1><b9><a3><e1><b9><87>avism, a major strand of Hinduism. Concentrating largely, but not exclusively, on Sanskritic source material, the author shows in the course of the book that Hindu image-worship may be understood via three levels of interpretation: the metaphysical/theological, the narratival or mythic, and the performative or ritual. Analysing the chief philosophical paradigm underlying Hindu image-worship and its implications, the book exemplifies its widespread application and tackles, among other topics such as the origins of image-worship in Hinduism, the transition from Vedic to image worship, a distinguishing feature of Hindu images: their multiple heads and limbs. Finally, with a view to laying the grounds for a more positive dialogic relationship between Hinduism and the <e2><80><9c>Abrahamic<e2><80><9d> faiths, which tend to condemn Hindu image-worship as <e2><80><9c>idolatry<e2><80><9d>, the author examines the theological explanation and justification for embodiment of the Deity in Hinduism and discusses how Hinduism might justify itself against such a charge. Rich in Indological detail, and with an impressive grasp of the philosophical and theological issues underlying Hindu material culture, and image-worship, this book will be of interest to academics and others studying theology, Indian philosophy and Hinduism. <c2><a9> 2017 Julius J.

To understand the role that students' epistemic curiosity plays in hands-on making contests, this study explored its correlation to students' positive affect and continuance intention to participate in a hands-on making contest called ``PowerTech''. PowerTech requires students to produce miniatures in the morning and use the miniatures to take part in relay racing and tug-of-war competitions in the afternoon. Data from 514 individuals were collected and subjected to confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling by AMOS 20. The results revealed the two types of epistemic curiosity (EC), interest (I-type) and informational deprivation type (D-type), played a mediating role in bonding participants' positive affect and their continuance intention to join a hands-on making contest. The implication of this study suggests students' epistemic curiosity can be aroused in the process of participating in competitive handson making contests such as PowerTech.","Hong, Jon-Chao and Hwang, Ming-Yueh and Szeto, Elson and Tai Kai-Hsin and and Tsai, Chi-Ruei",0,10.12973/eurasia.2016.1276a,1975

When technology use aligns with authentic or real-world applications, motivation can be enhanced.

Some examples of this overlap include skills related to control and autonomy (e.g., time management, project management, and decision making about choices provided), challenge (e.g., perseverance and patience through hard work, proposing a project and following it through to completion), collaboration and cooperation (e.g., teamwork, people skills, social skills, anger management, and communication with students at other schools), curiosity (e.g., finding resources online, finding the work interesting, and learning new things), and recognition (e.g., the opportunity to communicate beyond the school walls, a real product).

2786,The general 'instinct' tendencies,"Of the general instinct tendencies, which McDougall terms--in our opinion too widely--'general innate tendencies,' play, imitation, and sympathy are frequently spoken of as instincts. If the difference between such tendencies and instincts is merely the difference between general and specific, which ultimately appears to reduce itself to a difference of degree, then there is little to be said in criticism of such a way of speaking. There is, however, a further distinction to be drawn, as regards the interest or emotional factor involved. When we contrast imitation with anger or fear, it is evident that the emotional factor is a pronounced characteristic in the latter case, but hardly obtrudes itself, even as felt interest, in the former. Even in this respect the distinction does not seem an absolute one. For curiosity does not show any very pronounced emotional tone, and the acquisitive tendency still less, that is to say, under normal conditions. Here too then the difference appears to be merely one of degree between the general and specific tendencies. So much may be conceded, and yet the classification of the instinct tendencies into general and specific may be none the less convenient, though the line of demarcation between the two groups may, on closer examination, prove to be somewhat arbitrary. All the general tendencies are general, in that their arousal is not dependent upon a specific object, situation, or idea, nor even upon a more or less specific kind of object, situation, or idea, and in that the behaviour to which they lead, their expression, is as little specific. That they involve an affective element, an interest, goes without saying, but this affective element is not of the nature of emotion, nor does it show any tendency to develop into a particular and characteristic emotion in each case. And there is one other distinguishing mark, which might almost be called decisive. Under normal conditions the general instinct tendencies do not determine ends, but rather attach themselves to, and operate in connection with, ends ultimately determined by the specific emotional tendencies. There may be some apparent exceptions to this principle, and particularly in the case of play, but they are exceptions of the kind which 'prove the rule.' These general instinct tendencies, like the specific tendencies, have all been fully discussed and described by various psychologists, notably by Karl Groos, by Baldwin, and by McDougall. Our purpose here is, as before, to indicate those points which appear to be of educational interest, rather than to traverse ground already traversed.

2787,Urban design pedagogy,"We began this book with the claim that mapping plays a key role in the production of spatial knowledge; here we discuss the use of mapping in the propagation of knowledge, in helping students to explore, to see and to understand cities, as a tool in urban design pedagogy. While the potential of film (Strickland 2006), video (Lim et al. 2015) and GIS (Moudon 2015) in urban design teaching has received attention, the potential of morphological mapping remains relatively unexplored. This chapter is based on our experience of teaching the subject Morphological Mapping for third-year undergraduate students at the University of Melbourne. The key aim of the subject is to introduce students to multiple ways of seeing, observing and analysing complex urban environments, to raise their interest and curiosity as a starting point to a lifelong process of learning from cities. Direct observation is the basic method that enabled urban thinkers like Cerd<c3><a1>, Sitte, Lynch and Jacobs to gain their seminal insights on how cities work. Mapping can be a framework for structuring direct observation as well as focusing it on socio-spatial relations. We seek to defamiliarise the city for students in a manner that enables them to discover the less obvious dimensions of urbanity, to draw connections between morphologies and streetlife, between the measureable and the unmeasureable. <c2><a9> 2018 Taylor & Francis.","Pafka, E and Dovey, K",0,10.4324/9781315309170,1979
2789,The tyranny of dictatorship when the Greek tyrant met the Roman dictator,"The article examines the inaugural encounter of the Greek theory of tyranny and the Roman institution of dictatorship. Although the twentieth century is credited for fusing the tyrant and the dictator into one figure/concept, I trace the origins of this conceptual synthesis in a much earlier historical period, that of the later Roman Republic and the early Principate, and in the writings of two Greek historians of Rome, Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Appian of Alexandria. In their histories, the traditional interest in the relationship between the king and the tyrant is displaced, by a new curiosity about the tyrant and the dictator. The two historians placed the two figures alongside one another and found them, to be almost identical, blurring any previous empirical, analytical, or normative distinctions. In their Greco-Roman synthesis dictatorship is re-described as 'temporary tyranny by consent' and the tyrant as a 'permanent dictator.' Dictatorship, a venerated republican magistracy, the ultimate guardian of the Roman constitution, is for the first time radically reinterpreted and explicitly questioned. It meets its first critics. <c2><a9> 2007 Sage Publication.","Kalyvas, A",0,10.1177/0090591707302208,1980

2791,"Introducing ""abusive"": A new and improved standard for consumer protection","The economic downturn of 2008 made the American consumer a focus of intense curiosity and concern. Responding to this concern, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, introducing a new standard for consumer financial protection: ""abusive."" This standard is distinct from existing standards because it recognizes the imbalance between consumers and lenders in terms of understanding contract terms, obtaining information, altering the terms of an agreement, and evaluating and bearing risk. In doing so, it pushes back against narratives that lay the blame for the financial collapse at the feet of consumers without taking into account the structure of the consumer financial products market. Over eighty years after their introduction in consumer financial protection legislation, the terms ""deceptive"" and ""unfair"" no longer define the limits of consumer protection. Now, both advocates and policy makers must begin the long, collaborative endeavor of shaping what lies beyond those bounds. Reading the text of Dodd-Frank against its legislative history and social context suggests three ways the new ""abusive "" standard can be used. First, it can make consumer choices more meaningful by enhancing consumer understanding of contractual language-either directly or by motivating lenders to better inform their customers. Second, the ""abusive"" standard can give the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau power to modify products and take the most dangerous ones off the market entirely. Finally, the standard can impose a greater obligation on lenders to act in the interests of consumers. Exploring these avenues for implementation is the first step in developing a new framework for consumer financial protection.

2795,Is ideology the enemy of inquiry? Examining the link between political orientation and lack of interest in novel data,"Four studies examined the relationship between political orientation and data selection. In each study participants were given the opportunity to select data from a large data set addressing a specific issue: the justness of the world (Pilot Study), the efficacy of social safety nets (Studies 1-3), and the benefits of social media (Study 3). Participants were given no knowledge of what the data would tell them in advance. More conservative participants selected less data, and in Study 3 this relationship was partly accounted for by an increased tendency to question the value of science as a way of learning about the world. These findings may reveal one factor contributing to political polarization: an asymmetrical interest in scientific data.

2796,Norm repair,"All groups have norms. But different groups develop very different norms. Norms, simply put, are the shared implicit and explicit rules of a group, and comprise a major ingredient of the culture of the group. They include the stated rules such as ""you are expected to arrive on time,"" and more implicit rules such as ""do not sit in the therapist's chair."" Some norms are simple, such as ""wait for someone to pause before you speak,"" while others can be more complex, for example, ""do not express too much angry affect because the group gets frightened by it."" How do norms get established? Group members often carry into group therapy the norms of society, since norms are ubiquitous in society: ""Social norms are the 'rules' that govern behavior within each society"". In this regard, new members to a group often expect to be welcomed as though they were entering a social situation as guests. If unprepared for the fact that this is not typically a group norm (especially in psychodynamic groups), they may feel rejected or mistreated. Part of the therapist's task in group therapy is to initiate constructive norms and to recognize and modify disruptive or nontask-related norms, some of which are promoted by group members. Yalom and Leszcz write, ""Norms of a group are constructed both from expectations of the members for their group and from the explicit and implicit directions of the leader and more influential members"". Rutan, Stone, and Shay state, ""Since the therapist is a potent initiator of group norms, reinforcement through interest or noninterference serves to communicate and establish appropriate ways of interacting within the group"" (in press). Ulman remarks, ""I try from the outset to encourage the development of group norms that foster curiosity about everything that happens in group"". Norms can vary-some can evolve and change over time, while others become entrenched and difficult to modify. A particularly difficult situation arises when a norm is established inadvertently, and then ingrained, out of the conscious awareness of therapist or group members. These norms can be especially difficult to modify. The intervention described in the next section was developed to address one such situation. This intervention can be used in groups of all kinds since norms exist in all groups, and can go awry in any of the various group settings. In long-term groups, norms can, of course, become more entrenched and therefore harder to modify. The intervention was, however, used in a long-term open-ended co-ed group, with the intervention made about one year into the life of the group.

2797,"Science Curiosity in Learning Environments: Developing an Attitudinal Scale for Research in Schools, Homes, Museums, and the Community","Although curiosity is considered an integral aspect of science learning, researchers have debated how to define, measure, and support its development in individuals. Prior measures of curiosity include questionnaire type scales (primarily for adults) and behavioral measures. To address the need to measure scientific curiosity, the Science Curiosity in Learning Environments (SCILE) scale was created and validated as a 12-item scale to measure scientific curiosity in youth. The scale was developed through (a) adapting the language of the Curiosity and Exploration Inventory-II [Kashdan, T.<c2><a0>B., Gallagher, M.<c2><a0>W., Silvia, P.<c2><a0>J., Winterstein, B.<c2><a0>P., Breen, W.<c2><a0>E., Terhar, D., & Steger, M.<c2><a0>F.<c2><a0>(2009).

We administered a preliminary set of 30 items to 663 youth ages 8-18 in the U.S.A. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis resulted in a three-factor model: stretching, embracing, and science practices.

2798,Creative Writing and the Middle School Student,"Emerging adolescents should have ample opportunities to present creative ideas in written form. Some generalizations may be helpful in identifying and understanding the creative student. Creative people have been found to possess the following traits (Iris Tiedt, 1983): nonconformity of ideas, egotism and feelings of destiny, great curiosity, a sense of humor and playfulness, perseverance on self-started projects, intense emotions and sincerity, a tendency to be shy, and lack of rigidity. An emerging adolescent who lacks rigidity in writing is open to new ideas and experiments with the original, the novel, and the unique. Joy, which comes from an intrinsic desire to create and to communicate, is inherent in the ongoing and completed written product. Interest in writing is intense, and meaningful experiences are communicated. Motivation to achieve, develop, and grow is sequential and continuous. The creative middle school teacher sets the stage, provides readiness experiences, and stimulates and encourages emerging adolescents to appreciate and intrinsically value creativity in school and in society.

These can include a search for entertainment or social interaction, cultural interest, lifestyle preferences or simple curiosity. The factors behind cultural demand have already been analysed in great detail - especially considering some principal questions of interpretation (e.g. Goodey 1973; Field and Wagar 1976; Falk and Dierking 1992; Knudson et al. 1995; Knapp and Volk 1997; Beck and Cable 1998), experience creation (e.g. Prince 1982; Kaplan et al. 1998), and applied psychology (e.g. Loomis 1987; Ham 1994; Cassidy 1997). The number and variety of motivations for people to become customers are almost innumerable. All of the above-mentioned motivations could apply to any cultural space, meaning that different people with different backgrounds and needs are brought together at the same time. Given this variation in motivation and reasons for being in a cultural space, the issue of interpretation becomes very important.

2802,"Grounds for Learning: Schoolyard Activities as Provocations, Scaffolds and Mediators for Childhood Learning","Compelling evidence links childhood experiences in quasi-natural settings with learning and wellbeing, but, as cities grow, children's activities have been increasingly restricted to de-natured spaces that are designed or controlled by adults. In recent years, academics and education practitioners have campaigned to reverse this trend, and one result is that Australian early childhood centres and schools increasingly provide environments that enhance opportunities for children to engage with nature. These moves are also underpinned by higher-level policy initiatives. For example, the National Quality Standard, Element 3.2.1, requires that early childhood outdoor spaces are designed so that children experience natural environments (ACECQA, 2013). Similarly, the South Australian Department for Education and Child Development (2016, p. 5) Outdoor Learning Environments Standard mandates 'balanced environments which instil a sense of wonder, generate curiosity and spark the imagination of children and young people'. However, despite recent interest and policy initiatives, the processes by which environments influence learning remain 'under-researched' (Engelen et al., 2013, p. 324) and constitute a 'significant blind spot' (Rickinson et al., 2004, p. 8) in the literature.

Over a 7-yr period, 224 female and 622 male medical students completed the Personality Research Form when they were freshmen and juniors. Every significant shift reported by Burstein et al was replicated in the present study at higher significance levels. Changes recorded on the personality scales indicated a hedonistic pattern among the Ss between their freshman and junior years: less concern about achievement and orderliness, diminished intellectual curiosity and persistence, more interest in play and things sensuous, greater impulsivity, and higher aggression. While the shift was clear and typically displayed, it is concluded that it was not of a magnitude to suggest gross behavioral hedonism.

However, there is limited research addressing the development of a love of learning in the Australian context. This article draws on a small study - a survey of regional campus academics' perceptions of the love of learning and its importance, and how they sought to foster its development in their students.

Data sources included observation and field notes, students' written documents, audiotapes and videotapes of students working in groups, and student interviews. Sources of inspiration for students' problems and questions included cultural beliefs and folklore; wonderment about information propagated by advertisements and the media; curiosity arising from personal encounters, family members' concerns, or observations of others; and issues arising from previous lessons in the school curriculum. Questions asked individually pertained to validation of common beliefs and misconceptions, basic information, explanations, and imagined scenarios. The findings regarding questions asked collaboratively are presented as two assertions. Assertion 1 maintained that students' course of learning were driven by their questions. Assertion 2 was that the ability to ask the ``right'' questions and the extent to which these could be answered, were important in sustaining students' interest in the project.

2812,Tung lo wan: A lesbian haven or everyday life?,"Lesbian spaces as sites of resistance have been studied in the last decade with social geographer Gill Valentine urging geographers and urban sociologists to map lesbian neighbourhoods ""from nowhere to everywhere"" (Valentine 2000: 1). Notions of resistance have taken on multiple meanings within major theoretical strands such as postcolonialism, feminism, cultural geography, postmodernism, Marxism and queer theories. A mapping of resistance points to the interrelations and competing influences these theoretical strands have on each other. In this chapter, I will investigate how lesbian commercial spaces function as temporary sites of resistance for Hong Kong lesbians to validate their lesbian identities, to form social networks and to question their political subjectivities. I define lesbian commercial spaces as businesses that cater to lesbians through their marketing strategies such as posting on lesbian websites or passing out flyers at lesbian events. These spaces include lesbian bars, upstairs caf<c3><a9>s catering to lesbian customers and a lesbian specialty store. Geographically, resistance can be charted at a particular place over a period of time in overt terms such as protests, marches, riots and candlelight vigils. But resistance is also present on cyberspace such as guerrilla websites and online petitions, or with other forms of new media as in film and video. Resistance can be practised through our daily decisions when lesbians choose to meet friends at a lesbian bar or log online to chat with other lesbians. Minute as they seem, these decisions signify a need to bond with other women who have same-sex desires. A space of resistance points to a critique of structural relations of power manifested through spatialities, being global or local places. To speak of resistance is to acknowledge the nature of power. Structural relations of power affect the way we live our daily lives as gendered bodies, social beings and political subjects. Steve Pile asserts that resistance is not as easily pinned down to ""political subjectivities which are opposed to, or marginalized by, oppressive practices; whereby those who benefit from relations of domination act to reproduce them, while the oppressed have a natural interest in over-turning the situation"" (3). In other words, marginalized groups have more vested interests in engaging themselves as political subjects fighting ""over access, control and representation"" (Tonkiss 59). It is not surprising that most informants have stressed the importance of lesbian businesses being lesbianowned and operated. When power is defined through the spaces it aims to occupy, architectural design of buildings or public spaces come quick to my thoughts. Government buildings, streets, housing, schools, prisons, parks and shopping malls, just to name a few, signify institutional power both in and out of the spaces. The city of Hong Kong is widely known for its density in spatial terms and in population figures.1 Yet it is important to understand such density in both historical and economic terms, more specifically, a British colonial history in conjunction with a dominant real estate market narrative. Shortly after the occupation of Hong Kong island by the British Empire on January 25, 1841, the British government declared all land to be British-owned Crown land. This declaration allowed the colonial government to immediately organize an auction of 34 pieces of land within six months in order to generate operational expenses for the colonial government. Land sales since then has been a primary source of revenue for the government. As the population of Hong Kong increases overtime, land was purposely left undeveloped in order to formulate an excessively high demand for land and hence, to create profitable businesses for landowners. As a result, only 22% of Hong Kong's land has been developed for human inhabitation (Chen Cui'er et al. 2006: 14). It is widely understood that intense negotiation processes and structural planning were involved in making land sales viable, profitable and sustainable throughout the colonial era and in continuation for the current Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (17). In other words, geographical limitations may not be a sufficient answer to the high density of Hong Kong. Apart from the changes in government from a British colonial government to a Hong Kong SAR government under China, the stakeholders in land sales have also evolved from British merchants and a small community of Parsi merchants to a handful of land developers owned by Chinese tycoons (Feng 2001: 16). Land usage and urban development in Hong Kong has always been jointly regulated by the government and market forces with minimal community consultative processes. In the context of Hong Kong lesbian spaces, one needs to look at the nooks and crannies between buildings or walk up the narrow stairways leading up to cafes to make sense of how hegemonic power enacts itself through marginalization of lesbian spaces. Not only am I concerned about the physicality of spaces, but the human aspect of who has access to these spaces is critical in the analysis of power relations. Michel Foucault, by bringing up the notion of ""heterotopia"", suggests that heterotopias are ""counter-sites"" that challenge spatialities and social arrangements by inverting the common order of space (24). Fran Tonkiss further suggests that ""women-only spaces"" can be read as a modern version of the heterotopia, ""as heterotopias of separation that escape the eyes and the order of men"" (133). On the notion of multiple discourses, Marxist geographer David Harvey links postmodernism with Marxism through his analysis on urban issues and his notable observation on a contested public space such as Tompkins Park in New York City. Harvey believes in order to understand the composition of park users adequately, one must take into account the ""multiple discourses"" and ""contradictory codings"" among park users, such as students, young artists, yuppies, squatters or motorcyclists (201). Harvey's study on Tompkins Park reminds us to view public spaces as a field of rendering discourses in its own positionalities. He also points out how park users have used Tompkins Park as space of protests against various notions of power as defined by themselves. Similarly, lesbian spaces can also be a gathering place for women with different class backgrounds, levels of education, occupations, health status, ethnicities, gender and sexual identities. Although lesbian spaces in this case, are not public arenas comparable to open spaces such as parks and streets, the reasons for lesbians entering into a lesbian space can differ from curiosity to familiarity, offering a myriad of explanations specific to each person. <c2><a9> Hong Kong University Press 2010.

Klingberg mixes multiple anecdotes with scientific studies of widely varying methodological designs to describe intriguing suppositions about areas of the brain involved in mathematical reasoning, risk and rewards assessment, acute and chronic stress, dyslexia, dyscalculia, and so forth, with an emphasis on memory, especially working memory. Klingberg does give a more nuanced understanding of ""brain training."" There are many references to studies, especially those undertaken in other countries. The anecdotes and descriptions of many pieces of research are interesting and sure to pique the curiosity of most readers. It can be challenging to refrain from reading this book as a set of prescriptions for what to do and not to do in educational settings with children.

Most Ss' interest ran to facts rather than explanations. A few mentioned ""why"" questions, but none expressed curiosity about how historians gather and interpret information. A few of the Ss mentioned prehistoric times or the dawn of history, but none mentioned ancient civilizations. Girls mentioned more generic categories of historical topics and focused more on family themes and conditions of everyday living; boys tended to focus on great men and events. Ss' knowledge and thinking about history became more sophisticated following the unit, but certain misconceptions persisted. Ss had difficulty understanding the value of history in their lives outside of school.

2819,Intrinsic motivation to learn: Affective and cognitive correlates of learning and problem-solving,"The nature and operation of intrinsic motivation to learn was examined in the present research. Intrinsic motivation to learn was defined as an enduring personality disposition that differentiates out of general intrinsic motivation as an individual develops. In its operation intrinsic motivation to learn was hypothesized to be characterized by the factors of affect, competence, curiosity, persistence, and self-determination. Two studies were conducted with college students to examine the nature of the relationship between intrinsic motivation to learn and individual differences in subjective experiences during cognitive tasks. In Study 1, subjects studied a favorite subject and in Study 2, subjects were required to solve problems. In both studies subjective experiences were examined in terms of self-reported affect. Motivational indices, persistence, performance indices, and intelligence also were examined. It was found in both Study 1 and Study 2 that people at higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn experienced more positive affect than people at lower levels of intrinsic motivation to learn. People at higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn also experienced less negative affect while studying a favorite subject than people at lower levels of intrinsic motivation to learn. In Study 1, additional group differences were found on persistence and on all motivational indices except perceptions of ability and task difficulty. In Study 2, group differences were found in persistence and one of the motivational indices: Level of interest in the task. Significant group differences were also found on total SAT scores and verbal SAT scores. The results of the present research indicate that there are differences in the subjective experiences of people at different levels of intrinsic motivation to learn during their interaction with cognitive tasks. However, some of these differences are contingent upon the nature of the task. It is suggested that the results of (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Seth, Kamal",0,,2002

These characteristics present a challenge to the secondary school foreign language teacher, who will find the search for new materials and methods to maintain the interest of the gifted student an endless but fascinating process. Among the classroom activities that have been found effective in dealing with the gifted student are: (1) ""Who Am I?""--students describe themselves as imaginary objects; (2) ""Occupational Decisions""--students talk about their career goals; (3) ""To Have or Have Not""--one student provides clues regarding the identity of an imaginary item; and (4) ""Descriptive Cognates""--students describe themselves using cognates.

2826,Using Smartphones as Experimental Toolsâ€”a Follow-up: Cognitive Effects by Video Analysis and Reduction of Cognitive Load by Multiple Representations,"Mobile devices (smartphones or tablets) as experimental tools (METs) offer inspiring possibilities for science education, but until now, there has been little research studying this approach. Previous research indicated that METs have positive effects on students' interest and curiosity. The present investigation focuses on potential cognitive effects of METs using video analyses on tablets to investigate pendulum movements and an instruction that has been used before to study effects of smartphones' acceleration sensors. In a quasi-experimental repeated-measurement design, a treatment group uses METs (TG, N-TG = 23) and a control group works with traditional experimental tools (CG, N-CG = 28) to study the effects on interest, curiosity, and learning achievement. Moreover, various control variables were taken into account. We suppose that pupils in the TG have a lower extraneous cognitive load and higher learning achievement than those in the CG working with traditional experimental tools. ANCOVAs showed significantly higher levels of learning achievement in the TG (medium effect size). No differences were found for interest, curiosity, or cognitive load. This might be due to a smaller material context provided by tablets, in comparison to smartphones, as more pupils possess and are familiar with smartphones than with tablets. Another reason for the unchanged interest might be the composition of the sample: While previous research showed that especially originally less-interested students profited most from using METs, the current sample contained only specialized courses, i.e., students with a high original interest, for whom the effect of METs on their interest is presumably smaller.","Hochberg, Katrin and Becker, Sebastian and Louis, Malte and Klein, Pascal and Kuhn, Jochen",1,10.1007/s10956-020-09816-w,2005
2827,The involvement paradox: The role of cognitive absorption in mobile instant messaging user satisfaction,"Purpose Can mobile instant messaging (MIM) make people entering into the state of cognitive absorption (CA)? The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether CA can help explain users' satisfaction during the process of MIM, while interactivity and interest are operated as determinants of CA as well as directly associated with satisfaction. Design/methodology/approach This study proposes a satisfaction model that is adapted from the CA theory to investigate MIMs users' satisfaction with two determinants, interactivity and interest. Specifically, CA is operated as a second-order formative construct with four reflective dimensions, including curiosity, focused immersion, heightened enjoyment and temporal dissociation. Partial least square structural equation modeling was applied to evaluate the causal links of the model with the data collected from 472 LINE users who all had long using experience. Findings The results showed that CA in MIM, fueled by interactivity and interest, is positively related to satisfaction. Interactivity and interest themselves were also significantly associated with satisfaction. Among them, interactivity has the most influence on satisfaction, followed by interest and CA. Surprised, curiosity and focused immersion did not formative CA in MIM. Research limitations/implications The present study focuses on user satisfaction of a specific MIM (LINE) and collects data from users within a specific region (Taiwan). Other researchers must take these constrains into consideration when referencing this study. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study which confirmed that people still enter into the state of CA when using MIM on smartphone, even though the using environment is drastically different from that on desktop. It indicates that prior theories in CA with desktop-based software are still applicable and serve as a basis for more studies in the mobile context to a certain extent, but other factors should also be considered. As interactivity and interest are conducive to CA, leading to user satisfaction, an MIM app can be more popular if the two factors are incorporated.","Hou, Avus C Y and Shiau, Wen-Lung and Shang, Rong-An",1,10.1108/IMDS-06-2018-0245,2006

To date, abductive, inductive and deductive reasoning are considered as equally important for developing students' thinking skills, but only a few games have been designed for students to practice abductive reasoning. Thus, in this study, we designed a game named V-aquarium for junior high school students to practice abduction while learning science knowledge. To explore the effectiveness of the gameplay, using abductive reasoning, we attempted to understand the correlations between epistemic curiosity, cognitive fatigue, perceived learning value, and gameplay progress. A total of 307 valid data were collected for confirmatory analysis. The results revealed that two types of epistemic curiosity (interest-type and deprivation-type) were negatively related to cognitive fatigue but were positively related to the perceived learning value of gameplay (PLVG); cognitive fatigue was not significantly related to gameplay progress but was positively associated with the perceived learning value of gameplay. The implication of this study is that teachers could use V-aquarium to input the learning content they have taught for students to practice abduction in order to enhance their science knowledge learning.","Hwang, Ming-Yueh and Hong, Jon-Chao and Ye, Jian-Hong and Wu Yu-Feng and and Tai, Kai-Hsin and Kiu, Ming-Chi",1,10.1016/j.compedu.2019.04.014,2007

In this context, our work evaluates the use of mobile augmented reality without markers as the technology to implement a multiplayer game scenario that can be used to improve socialization, communication skills and emotional intelligence in primary school children. The present study addresses the usability of two gameplay styles and their impact on users' communication and motivation: competitive vs collaborative play. The game integrates Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) technology without markers to create a geolocation scenario with unlimited physical space. The results indicate that both game modes are intrinsically satisfactory for children triggering positive emotions such as enthusiasm, enjoyment and curiosity that improve the participants<e2><80><99> mood and help increase the degree of involvement. Moreover, we observed that the collaborative game version has a greater impact on emotional affection, social interaction and interest. In addition, we observed in our study that the quality of the communication in the collaborative mode is good in terms of several factors such as sustaining mutual understanding, dialogue management, information pooling, reaching consensus, time management and reciprocal interaction. Finally, several design implications and suggestions related to game time management, scaffolding, mixed competitive-collaborative modes, dynamic 3D content and active learning, among others, are discussed.

2831,"Individual differences in experience after a control task: Boredom proneness, curiosity, and grit correlate with emotion","Objectives The aims of the present study are to investigate (a) whether a control task (i.e., the grocery imagery task) classically used in emotion research and designed to emulate emotional neutrality is truly neutral and (b) how boredom proneness, curiosity, and grit influence emotions following this control task. Method State feeling of emotions were measured on 178 participants before and after the control task. Boredom proneness, curiosity, and grit was measured to examine the effect of these personality traits on participants' emotion before and after the control task. Results The findings demonstrate that the control task does not evoke a neutral state, but rather, it results in fluctuations in emotional experience and these fluctuations are only partially explained by personality traits associated with engagement and disengagement (boredom, curiosity, and grit). External boredom proneness was positively correlated with post-task boredom, resignation, and sadness. Internal boredom proneness and the feeling-of-interest dimension of curiosity were both positively correlated with joy and challenge/determination, whereas the feeling-of-deprivation dimension of curiosity was negatively correlated with joy. Finally, grit was positively correlated with interest. Conclusion The present study found that even following a control task intended to be emotionally neutral, emotional experience differs and personality can paint the way we perceive and thus react to these control conditions. These findings highlight the importance of considering the neutrality of control tasks and the effects of personality on control tasks in emotion research.","Sung, Billy and Yih, Jennifer and Wilson, Nicholas J",1,10.1111/ajpy.12268,2010

Somewhat weak predictive validity has been decided by way of significant positive correlations with students' semester science grades. Construct validity has been described and established by eight judges using six criteria, and supported through the use of factor analysis where four underlying factors were hypothesized as characteristics of science curiosity. Sex differences were also explored where significant differences were not found between the genders.

In the current study, younger and older adults read trivia questions, rated how curious they were to learn each answer, provided confidence and interest ratings, and judgments of learning after learning the answer. No age-related differences in memory were found. Analyses indicated that curiosity and interest contributed to the formation of judgments of learning. Additionally, interest had a unique increasing relationship with older, but not younger, adults' memory performance after a one-week delay.

2837,Falling in love and staying in love with science: ongoing informal science experiences support fascination for all children,"Ages 10-14 mark a period in which children develop a strong sense of whether science is `for them,' a time that typically coincides with the start of middle school in the United States and their first exposure to more rigorous science classes and testing. Experiences with science in and out of school can shape children's motivation to choose science careers or participate in voluntary science classes later on, for better or worse. We explore the hypothesis that children who engage in more informal educational science experiences at the start of this period are more likely than their peers to obtain and maintain interest, curiosity, and mastery goals in science (together forming a construct called fascination). We measured 983 children's fascination with science at the beginning and middle of sixth grade. We found that the children who participated in informal science during this time were more likely to maintain or have greater fascination than at the start. These findings held while also controlling for many potentially confounding covariates and are robust across subgroups by gender and race/ethnicity. Further, the effects are largest for those children whose family generally supports their learning.","Bonnette, Rachel N and Crowley, Kevin and Schunn, Christian D",1,10.1080/09500693.2019.1623431,2015
2838,Japanese learners' motivation for reading English,"The present study is an exploration of multiple dimensions of L2 learners' reading motivation and its relationship with L2 reading achievement. Based on theories of motivation and L1 and L2 studies, nine dimensions of motivation (Curiosity, Involvement, Challenge, Importance of L2 Reading, L2 Reading Self- Confidence, Instrumental Orientation, Recognition, Compliance, and Intrinsic Motivation for L1 Reading) were hypothesized to influence L2 reading achievement, and their dimensionality was examined using an L2 reading motivation questionnaire and statistical procedures. The participants, 1,030 students from nine Japanese universities, completed a 69-item Reading Motivation Questionnaire and a reading comprehension test. The questionnaire and test scores were statistically analyzed using the Rasch rating scale and dichotomous models, descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and structural equation modeling. The findings indicated that L2 reading motivation was multidimensional, consisting of both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. This result was consistent with previous studies conducted in L1 and L2 reading. Intrinsic motivation for L2 reading (Interest and Involvement in L2 Reading and Desire to Read L2 Materials) and one types of extrinsic motivation (Instrumental Orientation) exerted greater influence on L2 reading motivation than the other types of extrinsic motivation (Importance of L2 Reading, Recognition, and Compliance). That is, internally controlled motivation is more influential than externally controlled motivation with an exception of Instrumental Orientation. Another important finding was that L1 reading motivation and L2 reading motivations were similar to some extent because five of the eight factors (Intrinsic Interest and Involvement in L2 reading, Desire to Read L2 Materials, Importance of L2 Reading, Recognition, and Compliance) were found both in L1 and L2 reading motivation. However, three L2 specific factors (Instrumental Orientation, L2 Reading Self Confidence, and Intrinsic Interest in L1 Reading) were also identified. Thus, the study showed that there were some similarities as well as fundamental differences between L1 and L2 reading motivation. In terms of the relationship between L2 reading motivation and text comprehension, the L2 Reading Motivation and Comprehension Model demonstrated L2 reading motivation is significantly related to L2 text comprehension. Concerning individual differences between male and female students, the study showed that their profiles were similar although, on the average, the female students were more motivated to read as has been repeatedly found in L1 reading. Differences in the motivational profiles due to L2 proficiency showed that Recognition, the desire to be recognized by others by performing well, was a factor that differentiated the high and low groups. However, because the relationship between L2 Reading Motivation and L2 Reading Comprehension was not significant for both groups, it is possible that there was a problem with the reading test that was used to make the groups. In summary, the present study has demonstrated the vital role of L2 reading motivation in L2 reading, and pointed to the need to incorporate motivational support into L2 reading pedagogy as has been successfully practiced in L1 reading. This study is significant to the domain of L2 instruction and research for several reasons. First, it extends the knowledge base in L2 reading by identifying the influence of L2 reading motivation on L2 reading behavior. Second, the results of the study contribute to designing research-based reading instruction aimed at enhancing L2 reading motivation and performance. Finally, it is hoped that this study provides individual educators with practical suggestions on how to improve L2 reading instruction in their individual teaching contexts, focusing on both affective and cognitive aspects of L2 learners.

The aim was to investigate their change during task processing, their interrelations as well as their relations with metacognitive experiences in problem solving. Participants were 108 undergraduate students of psychology. They responded to three scenarios of varying difficulty describing learning situations. Performance on the tasks was followed by external feedback on the correctness of the response. The feedback created conditions eliciting epistemic emotions. The epistemic emotions were measured at three different times during task processing. There were also two measures of metacognitive experiences. The results showed that epistemic emotions differed in the three tasks, depending on the discrepancy between the initial schema that guided performance and the feedback. Furthermore, their intensity decreased as task processing progressed. There were also interrelations of epistemic emotions between them, particularly between confusion and wonder, and between surprise and all the other emotions.

While reading, students rated novelty, curiosity, impressiveness, importance, and willingness to reflect on each text segment. Participants were then assigned to one of three writing tasks, namely argumentation, text designing, and composition. Results showed that concepts were regarded as important, events/activities as impressive, and evaluations as most worthy of reflection.

2842,Does interest broaden or narrow attentional scope?,"Theory proposes that interest is a positive emotion that may either broaden attention to facilitate processing of new information, or narrow attention to preserve engagement with new information. To our knowledge, no research has directly examined the effect of interest on attentional scope. Across four experiments, we show that traits associated with the propensity to experience interestspecifically, trait curiosity and internal boredom pronenessare associated with a narrower scope of attention. We also find that, instead of broadening, interest actually narrows attentional scope in comparison to a neutral state and awe. Challenging the conventional notion that all positive emotions broaden cognition and attention, our findings suggest that specific emotions influence attention in ways that extend beyond a general emotional valence effect.","Sung, Billy and Yih, Jennifer",1,10.1080/02699931.2015.1071241,2020

2844,Discovering MOOC learner motivation and its moderating role,"In massive open online courses (MOOCs), learners have diverse types of motivation. Learners with different motivations have different interaction behaviours, presence, and learning outcomes. However, scant research has investigated the moderating role of learner motivations in the associations between presence and learning outcomes. This study examined MOOC learner motivation and its moderating role by surveying 646 MOOC learners. By exploratory factor analysis, this study identified four types of motivation: interest in knowledge, curiosity and expansion, connection and recognition, and professional relevance. Based on motivation, the study clustered learners into high-motivation, low-motivation, and asocial learners. Both high-motivation and asocial learners reported strong interest in knowledge and professional relevance, but asocial learners reported the lowest level of connection and recognition among the three groups of learners. Despite the low social presence, the asocial learners still had high levels of cognitive and teaching presence and learning outcomes. In addition, learners with higher presence generally perceived higher cognitive learning, but asocial learners with higher social presence were less satisfied. The results highlight the impacts of specific types of motivation to enrol in MOOCs and suggest designing different environments for learners with different motivation types.","Chen, Yue and Gao, Qin and Yuan, Quan and Tang, Yuanli",1,10.1080/0144929X.2019.1661520,2022

Toward this aim, I factor analyzed a battery of tests of cognitive ability, working memory, Intellect, Openness, affect, and intuition among a sample of English Sixth Form students (N=146). Four factors were revealed: explicit cognitive ability, intellectual engagement, affective engagement, and aesthetic engagement. In line with dual-process theory, each of these four factors showed differential relations with personality, impulsivity, and creative achievement. Affective engagement and aesthetic engagement were associated with creative achievement in the arts, whereas explicit cognitive ability and intellectual engagement were associated with creative achievement in the sciences.

The sample consisted of totally 43 (37 female and 6 male) sophomore prospective science teachers in 2013-2014 spring term. The data was collected with using of a questionnaire which was developed by one of the researcher. The data was analyzed through qualitative descriptive analysis. According to the results of the study, the prospective science teachers' cognitive emotional reactions were mainly categorized as positive and negative feelings. Positive feelings were curiosity, interest, excitement, enjoyable and pleasure and also negative feelings were disgust, displeasure, sad, stress and fear. Also five physiological-motor reactions were found. These were queasiness, trembling hands, loss of appetite, dizziness and dry mouth.","Besoluk, Senol and Demirhan, Eda",1,10.1051/shsconf/20162601120,2024
2847,The dimensionality and correlates of flow in human-computer interactions,"Studied playfulness in human-computer interactions (HCIs) from the perspective of flow theory, focusing on the dimensionality and correlates of flow. Study 1 developed a reliable measure of flow and explored the factor structure and correlates of flow in HCIs. 133 graduate students completed measures of flow, flexibility, modifiability, experimentation, and expected future use of the program at the end of a 1-day Lotus 1-2-3 course. Within computer interactions, flow consisted of 3 dimensions: control, attention focus, and cognitive enjoyment, which combines the factors of curiosity and intrinsic interest. Study 2 provided generalizability for the 1st study's findings by examining the correlates of flow in 43 accounting employees using a different type of software: electronic mail. Overall, flow experience was associated with perceived characteristics of the computer software and with relevant work-related outcomes.

2848,Appraisal components and emotion traits: Examining the appraisal basis of trait curiosity,"Individual differences related to emotions are typically represented as emotion traits. Although important, these descriptive models often do not address the psychological dynamics that underlie the trait. Appraisal theories of emotion assume that individual differences in emotions can be traced to differences in patterns of appraisal, but this hypothesis has largely gone untested. The present research explored whether individual differences in the emotion of interest, known as trait curiosity, consist of patterns of appraisal. After completing several measures of trait curiosity, participants read complex poems (Experiment 1) or viewed simple and complex pictures (Experiment 2) and then gave ratings of interest and interest's appraisal components. The effect of trait curiosity on interest was fully mediated by appraisals. Multilevel analyses suggested that curious people differ in the amount of appraisal rather than in the kinds of appraisals relevant to interest. Appraisal theories can offer a process-oriented explanation of emotion traits that bridges state and trait emotional experience.","Silvia, Paul J",1,10.1080/02699930701298481,2026

2852,Differences in learning motivations of professionals and nonprofessionals participating in two south Mississippi Institutes for Learning in Retirement,"This study investigated the differences in learning motivations of (a) professional and nonprofessional, and (b) urban and rural members of two south Mississippi Institutes for Learning in Retirement (ILR) programs in an attempt to expand C. O. Houle's conceptual model of continuing professional education into the retirement years and to determine if the life transitions of the older adult unite the learning orientations of these subpopulations into self-actualizing (growth) motives as part of the maturation process identified y Abraham Maslow. Ninety urban ILR and 60 rural ILR members were recruited. Professional was defined as having completed a bachelor's degree or above and licensure, certification, or registration. Variables were measured quantitatively using Roger Bashier's Education Participation Scale A-Form and qualitatively using open-ended questions on a demographic data survey collected using a one-time cross-sectional assessment of six intact groups at each location. Data were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance, chi square, and content-thematic coding. Significant findings (.05 level) indicated that nonprofessionals have pluralistic motives while professionals are motivated by intellectual curiosity. Cognitive Interest was the strongest motivator for all persons surveyed followed closely by Social Contact. Rural participants were more likely influenced by all motivational orientations than were urban members. Adventure learning for fun and pleasure was identified as a separate category from qualitative analysis. These findings are similar to the findings of previous research but expand the knowledge of the professional model into the postcareer years as well as providing a clue to learning motives for isolated, disadvantaged older adults who can benefit from expanded availability of programs into difficult to reach areas. These conclusions suggest that the needs of the often hard-to-reach older adult can be met with the ILR model and that additional models to include the underserved elderly populations should be developed.

2855,The Impact of Virtual Reality on Curiosity and Other Positive Characteristics,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible impact of virtual reality on curiosity. An associated aim was to assess the effect of virtual reality on positive and negative affect, vigor, flow and interest, and to explore whether curiosity prompted by virtual reality might be a mechanism linking virtual reality with affect, vigor, flow and interest. Participants were randomly assigned to an interactive virtual reality condition or a control condition. Participants in the virtual reality condition showed a significant increase across curiosity dimensions compared to participants in the control condition. Participants in the virtual reality condition also showed a significant increase in positive affect and vigor, and higher levels of flow and interest compared to participants in the control condition. Change in the exploration dimension of curiosity prompted by the virtual reality experience linked the experience with positive affect and interest. Virtual reality may be a vehicle for inducing curiosity and associated positive characteristics. <c2><a9> 2019, <c2><a9> 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Schutte, N S",1,10.1080/10447318.2019.1676520,2031

2859,Unpacking the triggers of interest in academic material: An appraisal perspective,"A study was conducted to apply a recent model of interest (Silvia, 2006) to educational goals and an educational context. The model is based on appraisal theory, and contends that interest is an emotional state dependent on appraisals of the novelty-complexity of an object of study and of one<e2><80><99>s coping potential to understand the object. Thus far, this model has been validated when the activity under investigation is viewing polygons and paintings, or reading poems, but the model<e2><80><99>s applicability to educational goals hasn<e2><80><99>t been investigated previously. The present research attempted to evaluate the significance of the model regarding the activity of reading expository, academic-oriented text, and to evaluate whether interest could be manipulated through alterations to a treatment text and contribute to increased learning compared to a control group as measured by a text comprehension test. Sixty-five Auburn undergraduate psychology students completed several instruments after random assignment to treatment and control groups, including assessments of interest and three appraisals at two times (pretest and one-third complete), the comprehension test, and measures of three control variables: trait curiosity, modal learning preference, and verbal ability. In addition to investigating effects on interest and learning, a third appraisal<e2><80><94>goal relevance (Lazarus, 1991)<e2><80><94>was postulated and measured to respond to a call in the literature (Silvia, 2005c) for a third appraisal for interest. Results showed that manipulations of the treated portion of the treatment text enhanced appraisals of coping potential to a statistically significant degree at a within-person level across time (F = 5.315; p = .025; partial eta sq. = .079). Additionally, the previously untested third appraisal, goal relevance, was shown to predict interest across the sample to a statistically significant degree (Unstandardized <ce><b2> = .567; t = 6.258; p < .001), displaying more predictive power than the combined effects of the original two appraisals. Non-significant findings included the absence of statistically significant differences in coping potential between-persons, in interest at between and within-person levels, and in learning. Statistical analysis of the present research and two pilot studies yielded the following implications. First, interest in academic material appeared to be manipulable rather than simply present or not present in the student without attributable cause. Second, this manipulated interest appeared to affect learning in a way consistent with the literature such that higher interest leads to higher learning. Third, hints of an extended appraisal model of interest emerged. A new model would include goal relevance alongside novelty-complexity and coping potential as interest<e2><80><99>s appraisals, and would identify vividness, coherence, and concreteness as key objective features strongly affecting the original two appraisals. The implications of this proposed extended model contribute two important features to our understanding of interest. First, additional insight is offered into the causes of text-based interest, including three key text features and a new appraisal. Second, in addition to a functionalist approach to interest, which accounts for novelty-complexity and coping potential appraisals, there appears to be a role for functional autonomy (Allport, 1961) in the generation and function of interest as well, which adds the effects of personality features and other individual differences to the functionalist account. Goal relevance, whose predictive power was the most significant finding of the study, fits well within the theoretical framework of functional autonomy, and would account for a diverse element of interest that enriches what the literature has already acknowledged about its universal element.","Connelly, Daniel Andrew",1,,2034
2860,Confused or Curious? Openness/Intellect Predicts More Positive Interest-Confusion Relations,"Open people show greater interest in situations that are complex, novel, and difficult to understand-situations that may also be experienced as confusing. Here we investigate the possibility that openness/intellect is centrally characterized by more positive relations between interest and confusion. Interest and confusion are key states experienced during engagement with information and learning. However, little is known about the within-person relation between them, let alone individual differences in this relation. We tested our hypotheses by making use of different paradigms, stimuli, and participants. Across five studies (N = 640) we tested the relation between openness/intellect and within-person interest-confusion relations in response to art (Study 1); science, philosophy, and art (Study 2); psychology lectures (Study 3); a poem (Study 4); and a complex problem solving task (Study 5). Average interest-confusion relations varied between different studies, but for all studies the distributions of the relations went from highly negative to highly positive-individual differences in direction rather than just degree. In all but 1 study we found consistent support for our hypotheses-openness/intellect is associated with more positive relations between interest and confusion. No other personality domain or intelligence was consistently related to interest-confusion relations. Together, these findings suggest a new phenomenological aspect of being open-curiosity toward confusing situations. Our findings support the link between openness/intellect and sensitivity to the value of complex information, and are discussed with regards to their relevance for engagement with information and learning.","Fayn, Kirill and Silvia, Paul J and Dejonckheere, Egon and Verdonck, Stijn and Kuppens, Peter",1,10.1037/pspp0000257,2035
2861,"Interrelations among response frequency, looking time and rated interest with visual stimuli","The present study examined interrelations among looking time (LT), response frequency (RF) where each response exposed the stimulus for 0.5 sec, and rated interest in 21 visual stimuli (slides). Subjects in the LT treatment looked at each slide for as long as they liked, and subjects in the RF treatment looked at each slide as often as they liked. In addition, all subjects rated the slides for ambiguity, complexity, novelty, pleasantness and interest on 7<e2><80><90>point scales. The LT, RF and interest scores were postulated as different measures of the level of specific curiosity aroused by the stimuli. The three measures were highly correlated. Further, subjective ambiguity, complexity and novelty were found to be positively related to LT, RF and rated interest. It was concluded that within a given situation and with a constant set of visual stimuli, the latter three measures reflect a construct which may be called the level of specific curiosity. 1975 Australian Psychological Society","Russell, A",1,10.1080/00049537508255254,2036
2862,Intellect: A theoretical framework for personality traits related to intellectual achievements,"The present article develops a theoretical framework for the structure of personality traits related to intellectual achievements. We postulate a 2-dimensional model, differentiating between 2 processes (Seek and Conquer) and 3 operations (Think, Learn, and Create). The framework was operationalized by a newly developed measure, which was validated based on 2 samples. Subsequently, in 3 studies (overall N = 1,478), the 2-dimensional structure of the Intellect framework was generally supported. Additionally, subdimensions of the Intellect framework specifically predicted conceptually related criteria, including scholastic performance, vocational interest, and leisure activities. Furthermore, results from multidimensional scaling and higher order confirmatory factor analyses show that the framework allows for the incorporation of several constructs that have been proposed on different theoretical backgrounds, such as need for cognition, typical intellectual engagement, curiosity, intrinsic motivation, goal orientation, and openness to ideas. It is concluded that based on the Intellect framework, these constructs, which have been researched separately in the literature, can be meaningfully integrated.","Mussel, Patrick",1,10.1037/a0031918,2037
2863,How does participation and browsing affect continuance intention in virtual communities? An integration of curiosity theory and subjective well-being,"Based on theories about curiosity and subjective well-being (SWB), this study proposes a research model for how participation and browsing initiate different routes to satisfying members' diverse needs, thus increasing their SWB and their continuance intention in knowledge-based virtual communities (VCs). Two curiosity constructs, informational deprivation epistemic curiosity (D-EC) and interest-type epistemic curiosity (I-EC), moderate the wanting route and liking route, respectively. The research model is tested with data from 476 members of one knowledge-based VC using a web survey. Results show that member participation stimulates the wanting route to satisfaction by activating the need for reflective learning and uncertainty reduction, whereas browsing stimulates the liking route to member satisfaction by eliciting enjoyment. Both routes thus increase member SWB and, ultimately, continuance intention. Along the wanting route, D-EC reinforces relationships related to reflective learning but attenuates those related to uncertainty. I-EC alleviates the relationships along the liking route. Comparisons of the relative importance of hypothesised relationships between participants and lurkers indicate that participants feel more satisfied with knowledge sharing, enjoy greater SWB, and maintain higher continuance intention than lurkers. These results can therefore help managers of VCs leverage learning- or fun-oriented mechanisms, depending on member curiosity type.","Fang, Yu-Hui and Li, Chia-Ying and Arain, Ghulam Ali and Bhatti, Zeeshan Ahmed",1,10.1080/0144929X.2019.1685002,2038
2864,"Using Smartphones as Experimental Tools-Effects on Interest, Curiosity, and Learning in Physics Education","Smartphones as experimental tools (SETs) offer inspiring possibilities for science education, as their built-in sensors allow many different measurements, but until now, there has been little research that studies this approach. Due to current interest in their development, it seems necessary to provide empirical evidence about potential effects of SETs by a well-controlled study. For the present investigation, experiments were developed that use the smartphones' acceleration sensors to investigate an important topic of classical mechanics (pendulum). A quasi-experimental repeated-measurement design, consisting of an experimental group using SETs (smartphone group, SG, N (SG) = 87) and a control group working with traditional experimental tools (CG, N (CG) = 67), was used to study the effects on interest, curiosity, and learning achievement. Moreover, various control variables were taken into account. With multiple-regression analyses and ANCOVA, we found significantly higher levels of interest in the SG (small to medium effect size). Pupils that were less interested at the beginning of the study profited most from implementing SETs. Moreover, the SG showed higher levels of topic-specific curiosity (small effect size). No differences were found for learning achievement. This means that the often-supposed cognitive disadvantage of distracting learners with technological devices did not lead to reduced learning, whereas interest and curiosity were apparently fostered. Moreover, the study contributes evidence that could reduce potential concerns related to classroom use of smartphones and similar devices (increased cognitive load, mere novelty effect). In sum, the study presents encouraging results for the under-researched topic of SET use in science classrooms.","Hochberg, Katrin and Kuhn, Jochen and Mueller, Andreas",1,10.1007/s10956-018-9731-7,2039

2866,What is interesting? - Exploring the appraisal structure of interest,"Relative to other emotions, interest is poorly understood. On the basis of theories of appraisal process and structure, it was predicted that interest consists of appraisals of novelty (factors related to unfamiliarity and complexity) and appraisals of coping potential (the ability to understand the new, complex thing). Four experiments. using in vivo rather than retrospective methods, supported this appraisal structure. The findings were general across measured and manipulated appraisals, interesting stimuli (random polygons, visual art. poetry), and measures of interest (self-reports. forced-choice, behavioral measures). Furthermore, the appraisal structure was specific to interest (it did not predict enjoyment, a related positive emotion). and appraisals predicted interest beyond relevant traits (curiosity. openness). The appraisal perspective offers a powerful way of construing the causes of interest.","Silvia, P J",1,10.1037/1528-3542.5.1.89,2041

Aims The goal of the present study was to introduce and evaluate a new intervention in science education aimed at developing children's epistemic beliefs, epistemic curiosity, and investigative interests. The intervention included an inquiry-based learning approach as well as reflections on epistemic issues because these methods are currently seen as most promising for fostering students' epistemic beliefs. Sample Data were collected from 65 elementary school children in Grades 3 and 4 (58.46% boys, age: M = 8.73, SD = 0.60) who participated in a voluntary extracurricular STEM enrichment programme in south-west Germany. Methods We investigated the effectiveness of the intervention by applying a randomized block design with a treated control group and repeated measures. The effectiveness of the intervention was analysed via multiple linear regression analyses. Results The results indicated that the children assigned to the intervention developed more sophisticated epistemic beliefs and a higher level of epistemic curiosity than the children assigned to the control condition. No intervention effects were found on investigative interests. Conclusions The results provide initial evidence for the effectiveness of the intervention and demonstrate that it is possible to improve epistemic beliefs among elementary school children in Grades 3 and 4. The study provides a starting point for understanding how young children develop epistemic beliefs.","Schiefer, Julia and Golle, Jessika and Tibus, Maike and Herbein, Evelin and Gindele, Verena and Trautwein, Ulrich and Oschatz, Kerstin",1,10.1111/bjep.12301,2042

The present research explores the implications of appraisal theories of emotion for the study of interest as an emotion relevant to aesthetics. Participants viewed pictures of modern experimental visual art and rated each picture for interest and for appraisals of complexity and comprehensibility. Multilevel modeling assessed the within-person effects of appraisals on interest. As predicted by appraisal theories, both appraisals significantly and strongly predicted interest at the within-person level. The within-person relationships were not moderated by individual-differences relevant to interest in art (e.g., trait curiosity). Theories of ""aesthetic response"" should capitalize on modern theories and findings in emotion psychology.

Factor analyses of data representing 243 participants suggested the existence of five stable factors among 46 questionnaire items. These dimensions were labeled Interest, Authenticity, Curiosity, Involvement and Fidelity. Though further empirical testing is necessary, we expect that the questionnaire will prove to be a useful tool for the appraisal of video games, as well as for the identification of critical differences between those who play them.","Mayes, D K and Cotton, J E",1,,2044

Participants were 341 students enrolled in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean language classes in midwestern university settings. The Motivational Orientation Survey (MOS), a self-report questionnaire, was developed to measure the students' motivational orientation. The Cronbach's alpha of the MOS was .92. The MOS was divided into seven motivational orientation (MO) subscales: Integrative, Instrumental, Heritage-Related, Travel, Interest, School-Related, and Language Use MO subscales. The Sung Language Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SLSAQ), a self-report questionnaire, was used to measure students' proficiency in four language areas: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. East Asian language learners reported that they were highly motivated by: (1) Interest MO, interest in the language and general curiosity; (2) Language Use MO, particularly in speaking and understanding spoken language, and communicating with native speakers; (3) Integrative MO; (4) Travel MO; and (5) Instrumental MO. Participants reported that they were strongly motivated by both Integrative MO and Instrumental MO. The mean of Integrative MO was significantly higher than that of Instrumental MO. Participants reported that they were more proficient in speaking and listening than in reading and writing. A significant correlation was found between motivational orientation and language proficiency. The language of study, heritage language, requirement, and language proficiency variables had statistically significant effects on students' motivational orientation. Korean learners reported that they were more strongly motivated than Chinese or Japanese learners. Heritage and requirement were the most influential variables on student's motivational orientation. There was an interaction effect between heritage and requirement: heritage students fulfilling a foreign language requirement had the strongest motivational orientation. Female heritage students had a stronger motivation than male heritage students. The language of study and the heritage language significantly influenced students' proficiency. Heritage students reported higher proficiency than non-heritage students in listening and reading. Korean and Japanese learners reported higher proficiency than Chinese learners in reading. Japanese learners' writing proficiency was higher than that of Chinese learners.","Ryu Yang, Jean Sook",1,,2046
2876,Correlation of personality traits with success in scientific decision-making,"Students were trained in decision-making skills in a 10-mo Wayland Baptist College Decision-Making Project. At the end of the project 20 students wrote decision statements which were ranked by judges for successful use of decision-making skills. Rankings for strength in 59 personality traits were available from personality profiles prepared for each student at the beginning of the project. The following personality traits were found to be significantly related to success in scientific decision making: mathematical ability, practical problem-solving, rote memory, concentration, range of interests, curiosity, good imagination, maturity, and purposiveness. Interest in school and study habits were also positively related. These traits, found in successful decision makers, suggest a student who is eager to learn. They support like findings in other Wayland Project studies.

2877,An Investigation of Self-Efficacy and Topic Emotions in Entry-Level Engineering Design Learning Activities,"Little is known about the impact self-efficacy and topic emotions have on novice engineering students when first exposed to an engineering design course. Freshman students may have difficulties regulating their emotions when exposed to new or complex topics such as engineering design. Consequently, they may become frustrated or discouraged as the semester progresses that can lead to feelings of hopelessness and anxiety. In contrast, novice students may experience feelings of hope and interest that may foster positive learning outcomes in engineering design. The authors explored freshmen engineering students' (n = 58) levels of self-efficacy and topic emotions while participating on a freshmen-level engineering and graphics design course. Our findings suggests that while positive and negative topic emotions are inversely related, both seem to be associated with self-efficacy. Further, topic emotions appear to mediate self-efficacy as topic emotions such as curiosity, happiness, and interest were reported by engineering students during engineering design activities. Self-efficacy increased over the course of the semester for these freshman engineering design students.","Jones, Suzanne H and Campbell, Brett D and Villanueva, Idalis",1,,2048
2878,"The relationship among student creativity, curiosity, and academic intrinsic motivation: A mixed methods phenomenological study of sixth grade students","The purpose of this study was to examine the constructs of creativity, curiosity, and academic intrinsic motivation as they related to sixth grade students. These variables were examined independent of achievement scores in order to focus on the ways in which creativity and curiosity related to the participants' academic intrinsic motivation. In today's educational climate, there are students who are disengaged in learning because of the use of standardized, high-stakes assessment. This disengagement can influence an individual's self-concept and feelings towards present and future learning. Self-determination theory served as the theoretical framework for this study as the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness was examined in relation to creativity, curiosity, and academic intrinsic motivation. Quantitative data for the 87 participants in the first phase of the study were collected using valid and reliable instruments which measured the participants' levels of creativity, curiosity, and academic intrinsic motivation. The data were analyzed using correlational tests. After identifying the levels of each of the study's constructs that, when combined, formed statistically significant patterns, the 23 participants, whose levels of creativity, curiosity, and academic intrinsic motivation combined to fit a significant relationship, completed an on-line survey in order to collect qualitative data. The data were used to determine the characteristics and factors regarding the study's variables that were common among the different groups. Results of this study indicated that participants' levels of curiosity and academic intrinsic motivation were opposite their levels of creativity. In addition, subject-specific motivation followed this same opposing relationship for low reading and mathematics motivation, as well as for high reading and social studies motivation. The most substantial findings of the qualitative portion of the study were that students with high creativity, low curiosity, and low academic intrinsic motivation levels reported that they do not have an opportunity to learn about their interests in school and that they were better at things outside of school. The researcher made recommendations to educate all stakeholders about creativity and creative behaviors, as individuals with these characteristics may be disenfranchised from learning - a factor that can influence future learning and well-being.","Rinkevich, Jennifer L",1,,2049
2881,A Comparison of Flipped and Traditional Classroom Learning: A Case Study in Mechanical Engineering,"The flipped classroom has been introduced to promote collaborative learning and higher-order learning objectives. In contrast to the traditional classroom, the flipped classroom has students watch prerecorded lecture videos before coming to class and then ``class becomes the place to work through problems, advance concepts, and engage in collaborative learning''. In this paper, the active flipped learning was applied in engineering mechanics class to combine flipped classroom with active learning in order to establish an active flipped learning (AFL) model, aiming to promote active learning. Eighty sophomores engineering students, most of whom are African-American students, participated the active flipped learning. To compare the effect of AFL, the traditional teaching was applied in the first half semester and pre- and post-tests were used to evaluate their learning performance. After the mid-term exams, five flipped models were applied to five topics. All of the students attended these flipped models. Pre- and post-tests were conducted for the AFL. The survey results were analyzed to compare students' learning self-efficacy and satisfaction between the traditional and the active flipped classroom. Compared to the traditional classroom, students' learning motivation is obviously enhanced in the AFL classroom, with students' interest, curiosity and learning initiatives in curriculum promoted, intrinsic goal orientation further strengthened, in which students tend to have less extrinsic goal orientation and lower test anxiety than the students in the traditional classroom, but with improved control beliefs and self-efficacy for learning. In the traditional classroom, students use more rehearsal and elaboration strategies, while in the flipped classroom, students use more organization strategies and prefer to use critical thinking strategies to raise relative questions about teaching content and video materials. Students in the AFL model use more strategies of resource management, such as time and study environment, effort regulation, peer learning, and help seeking than in the traditional model. In comparison of different student groups, the AFL model effectively improves students' motivation in both long and short learning time groups, but the effects are not obvious on the low GPA students. From the perspective of gender, the AFL model helps to increase the male students' learning motivation, while female students use more learning strategies in task value, control belief and self efficacy in traditional model. Therefore, the instructors should pay more attention in improving the learning motivation and effectiveness of low GPA group and female students in the flipped classroom. In summary, the AFL model, by taking advantage of advanced technology, is a convenient and professional avenue for engineering students to strengthen their academic confidence and self-efficacy in Engineering Mechanics by actively participating in learning and fostering their deep understanding of engineering statics and dynamics.","Yan, Jing and Li, Lin and Yin, Jianjun and Nie, Yujing",1,,2050
2882,"The influence of subjective value, importance, and interest on memory and metacognition in older and younger adults","It is well documented that memory abilities decline in older adulthood. However, age-related memory deficits may be reduced for information that is more interesting or valuable. Using a variety of unique approaches, the current studies examined whether subjective value and interest impacted memory and metacognitive judgments (i.e., predictions about what one will remember) in older and younger adults in order to better understand mechanisms that enhance memory and metacognitive accuracy. Experiments 1, 2, and 3 utilized a paradigm in which older and younger adults were presented with lists of words, word pairs, or items within specific scenarios. For each item, participants assigned it a value (from 0-10) that was akin to a ""bet"" on the likelihood it would be remembered. The results indicated that older and younger adults were equally able to remember items assigned higher values, and that accuracy of predictions increased with task experience. Furthermore, when participants were able to rely on semantic knowledge, age-related differences in memory performance were eliminated. Experiments 4 and 5 examined whether subjective interest and curiosity to learn influenced memory and metacognitive predictions in older and younger adults. In Experiments 4 and 5, participants were presented with trivia questions and asked to indicate how ""curious"" they were to learn the answer, after which they were shown the correct answer. In Experiment 5 participants also provided post-answer interest ratings and predictions of the likelihood the fact would be remembered. After a week delay, older and younger adults were more likely to recall answers to questions initially assigned higher ratings of curiosity and interest. Furthermore, predictions regarding what information would be recalled were highly accurate for both younger and older adults, and were influenced by interest in the material. The results of all of the studies suggest that the ability to recall what one subjectively indicates is more valuable or interesting does not decline during the aging process. Furthermore, both younger and older adults displayed highly accurate insight regarding what information was likely to be remembered or forgotten, and they were able to use this knowledge to strategically maximize goal-related memory outcomes and performance.

2883,Curiosity and interest in later adulthood,"Studied curiosity and exploratory attitudes and behaviors in older women. 134 women (aged 65-66 yrs) completed interviews and questionnaires assessing their current levels of curiosity and exploratory behavior; changes in interests, leisure activities, and exploratory behaviors and attitudes over the last 10 yrs; and novel life events over the last 10 yrs. A German version of the Melbourne Curiosity Inventory by R. Naylor (1981) was used. (English abstract) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Saup, W",1,,2052
2884,Motivational and cognitive influences on conceptual knowledge: The combination of science observation and interesting texts,"This study examined the relationship between types of texts and science observation, and their effects on reading motivations and conceptual knowledge. Motivations to read include challenge, involvement, curiosity, and interest. Interest in a topic enhances the amount, depth, and fullness of conceptual learning from a text about that topic. Constructing knowledge when multiple texts are present also involves a process of searching for, comprehending, and integrating information from multiple sources. This search process is dependent on what information students attend to, what information is important and relevant to the task, motivational variables, the use of cognitive strategies, self-regulation strategies, and motivations for understanding. Students' learning goals and questions, in turn, may depend on their experiences. Science observations, involving multi-sensory experiences with concrete objects, are intriguing. When conditions are favorable, readers can gain knowledge and a sense of self-efficacy or self-competence, through processing expository text, especially when students have a personal reason or goal for gaining this knowledge, show interest in the topic, and can be somewhat self-determined. This process of engagement can be influenced by classroom contexts. The study was conducted in six self-contained, multicultural classrooms in a metropolitan area in the U.S. using a 2 x 2 factorial, experimental design. The factors were Interesting Texts and Science Observation. There were three treatment conditions and one control group in the study. This study showed that the students in the treatment group who conducted science observations and read interesting texts, gained more conceptual knowledge than any other condition. This study extends the CORI and Explorers program research to show that these two instructional factors are in fact, dynamic and statistically significant in terms of motivating elementary age students to read and to gain conceptual knowledge from expository text. The results of this study speak to the domain of science, making a valid case for the inclusion of texts. The current study found that pure discovery learning, without access to text, did not yield significant knowledge gains.
