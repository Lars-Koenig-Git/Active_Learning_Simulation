2,Acupressure at BL60 and K3 Points Before Heel Lancing in Preterm Infants,"CONTEXT: Acupressure is an ancient Chinese healing art. In this pain-relieving method, the fingers are used to press key acupuncture points on the skin surface that stimulates the body◊≥s regulatory processes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of acupressure at Kun Lun (UB60) and Taixi (K3) points for pain management in preterm infants prior to heel lancing for blood collection. DESIGN: This was a prospective, randomized controlled study. SETTING: The study setting was the neonatal intensive care unit at Baskent University Hospital in Turkey. PATIENTS: A total of 32 preterm infants between 28 and 36 weeks◊≥ gestational age were randomly assigned to one of two groups: an acupressure group (n = 16) or a control group (n = 16). INTERVENTION: In the acupressure group, immediately before the heel prick, acupressure was applied for three minutes at UB60 and K3 points. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A behavioral pain score was determined using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scale. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to gestational age, birth weight, sex, mode of delivery, age at time of procedure, weight at time of procedure, or PIPP score. Mean duration of procedure and mean duration of crying were both shorter in the acupressure group (both P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Applying acupressure at the BL60 and K3 points before heel lancing was associated with shorter procedural time and shorter duration of crying in preterm infants.","Abbasoƒülu, A. and Cabƒ±oƒülu, M.

3,Soothing methods used to calm a baby in an Arab country,"This study was undertaken to determine how mothers soothed their crying infants. A total of 1137 mothers of different cultural backgrounds were approached, 998 agreed to participate in the study, but only 716 completed the questionnaire through a telephone interview. Analysis was restricted to 702 mothers from the UAE nationality, other Arabs, other Muslims, Indians and Philippinos. The questionnaire contained 23 questions on different soothing methods. The most common soothing method was breast-feeding (99.1%), followed by holding and carrying the infant (96.9%), letting infant suck on his thumb or finger (87.3%), herbal tea (65%), night bottle (42.1%) and swaddling infant (19.5%). Over 90% of mothers of all nationalities, preferred not to use pacifiers. Soothing herbs were often used, with the commonest being anise (165 mothers used anise). Fennel tea was also used by a substantial number of mothers (75), with gripe water (64), cumin (33), chamomile (32), mint (22) and fenugreek (16) making up most of the rest. Conclusion: Mothers' ethnicity and nationality strongly impacted on the soothing methods used, with Arabs more often using herbal tea, prone positioning and swaddling to calm infants and illustrate the importance of culture in the upbringing of children from a very early age. ¬© 2008 The Author(s).","Abdulrazzaq, Y.

4,"The mechanisms and moderators of ""fade-out"": Towards understanding why the skills of early childhood program participants converge over time with the skills of other children","Early childhood education (ECE) programs have been shown to produce immediate positive impacts on children's cognitive abilities, academic knowledge, and social-emotional skills. However, some research suggests that impacts may be modest and short-lived. That is, even though ECE enables participating children to begin kindergarten with greater skills on average compared with their peers, the skills of ECE attendees and nonattendees appear to converge as children progress through school. Thus, any initial differences between these groups observed at school entry are reduced or eliminated over time, a phenomenon that has been described as ""fade-out,"" ""catch-up,"" or both. This systematic review assesses our current understanding of the conditions under which ECE impacts persist or fade over time, which is critical because of the potential intervention and policy implications. Recent work has begun to make progress in this direction, but future efforts that address the present gaps and limitations of the field are needed in order to maximize the long-term impacts of the next generation of ECE programs. ¬© 2019 American Psychological Association.","Abenavoli, R.

5,Improving parenting practices and development for young children in Rwanda: Results from a randomized control trial,"It is well known that the first 1,000 days of life have long-lasting impact on a child‚Äôs cognitive, language, socio-emotional, and physical development, but there is little evidence from Rwanda about how to maximize parent‚Äìchild interactions during these critical early years. Save the Children piloted the First Steps ‚ÄúIntera za Mbere‚Äù early childhood parenting education program in one district of Rwanda to promote healthy development through holistic parenting education. Using a cluster randomized control trial, we assessed outcomes of a 17-week parenting education on parenting skills and child development for families with children aged 6‚Äì36 months. Families were randomly allocated into three study groups: light touch (n = 482), full intervention (n = 482), and control (n = 483) groups. We used a Kinyarwanda-adaptation of the validated Ages & Stages Questionnaires (ASQ), a Home Observation Measurement of the Environment-Short Form. Multivariate linear and logistic regression analyses were used for both the intention-to-treat analyses and more robust models controlling for ASQ form received, child gender, maternal education, number of children in the home, and baseline ASQ scores. Findings indicate that children in the light touch and full intervention groups were significantly more likely to meet the ASQ benchmarks than the control group in all developmental domains. The strong positive results from the light touch group are especially relevant to efforts to bring beneficial early childhood stimulation programs to scale in low-income contexts. ¬© The Author(s) 2019.","Abimpaye, M. and Dusabe, C. and Nzabonimpa, J.

7,Temperament in infancy and behavioral and emotional problems at age 5.5: The EDEN mother-child cohort,"Objective: Early temperamental characteristics may influence children's developmental pathways and predict future psychopathology. However, the environmental context may also shape or interact with infant temperament and indirectly contribute to increased vulnerability to adverse developmental outcomes. The aim of the present study is to explore the long-term contribution of temperamental traits at twelve months of age to the presence of emotional and behavioral problems later in childhood, and whether this association varies with the child's sex, parental separation, family socioeconomic status and maternal depression. Method: 1184 mother-child pairs from the EDEN mother-child birth cohort study based in France (2003-2011), were followed from 24-28 weeks of pregnancy to the child's fifth birthday. Infant temperament at 12 months was assessed with the Emotionality Activity and Sociability (EAS) questionnaire and behavior at 5.5 years was assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Results: Emotional temperament in infancy predicts children's overall behavioral scores (Œ≤ = 1.16, p<0.001), emotional difficulties (Œ≤ = 0.30, p<0.001), conduct problems (Œ≤ = 0.51, p<0.001) and symptoms of hyperactivity/inattention (Œ≤ = 0.31, p = 0.01) at 5.5 years. Infants' active temperament predicts later conduct problems (Œ≤ = 0.30, p = 0.02), while shyness predicts later emotional problems (Œ≤ = 0.22, p = 0.04). The association between the child's temperament in infancy and later behavior did not vary with children's own or family characteristics. Conclusion: An emotional temperament in infancy is associated with higher levels of emotional and behavioral difficulties at the age of 5.5 years. Children who show high emotionality early on may require early prevention and intervention efforts to divert possible adverse developmental pathways. ¬© 2017 Abulizi et al.

8,An Examination of Peer-Delivered Parenting Skills Programs Across New York State,"Peers are an important adjunct to the public mental health service system, and are being increasingly utilized across the country as a cost-effective solution to workforce shortages. Despite the tremendous growth of peer-delivered support over the past two decades, it has only been within the past few years that peer programs have been the subject of empirical inquiry. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and characteristics of peer-delivered parenting programs across the New York State public mental health service system. We surveyed 46 family peer organizations across New York State regarding their delivery of structured peer-delivered parenting programs. Thirty-four (76%) completed the questionnaire, and of them, 18 (53%) delivered a parenting program. Subsequent interviews with seven of the 18 organizations revealed peer organizations had been delivering eight unique parenting programs for upwards of two decades. Additionally, organizations offered multiple supports to families to participate. Training, supervision, and issues around fidelity are discussed, as well as the implications of this study for states utilizing a peer workforce. ¬© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Acri, M.

9,Pacifier use in children: A review of recent literature,"Pediatric dentists are generally well aware of the oral implications of nonnutritive sucking (NNS). NNS via digit or pacifier can effect changes in the occlusion, including openbite, excessive overjet, and possibly posterior crossbite. Skeletal changes have also been attributed to NNS. There is some evidence that pacifiers may do less harm to the dentition, particularly because pacifier habits are often spontaneously shed at about 2 to 4 years of age. Digit habits are more likely to persist into the school-age years and can require appliance therapy for discontinuation. Thus, some authorities suggest that pacifiers be recommended for infants who engage in NNS. While pediatric dentists understand the oral and perioral effects of pacifiers, they may be less well versed in other aspects of pacifier use that have been reported in the medical, nursing, chemical, and psychological literature. This paper provides reviews of literature concerning the role of pacifier NNS in 4 areas: (1) sudden infant death syndrome","Adair, S. M.",0,8
10,Shedding light on excessive crying in babies,"Background: Excessive and inconsolable crying behavior in otherwise healthy infants (a condition called infant colic (IC)) is very distressing to parents, may lead to maternal depression, and in extreme cases, may result in shaken baby syndrome. Despite the high prevalence of this condition (20% of healthy infants), the underlying neural mechanisms of IC are still unknown. Methods: By employing the latest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in newborns, we prospectively investigated whether newborns‚Äô early brain responses to a sensory stimulus (smell) is associated with a subsequent crying behavior. Results: In our sample population of 21 healthy breastfed newborns, those who developed IC at 6 weeks exhibited brain activation and functional connectivity in primary and secondary olfactory brain areas that were distinct from those in babies that did not develop IC. Different activation in brain regions known to be involved in sensory integration was also observed in colicky babies. These responses measured shortly after birth were highly correlated with the mean crying time at 6 weeks of age. Conclusions: Our results offer novel insights into IC pathophysiology by demonstrating that, shortly after birth, the central nervous system of babies developing IC has already greater reactivity to sensory stimuli than that of their noncolicky peers. Impact: Shortly after birth, the central nervous system of colicky infants has a greater sensitivity to olfactory stimuli than that of their noncolicky peers. This early sensitivity explains as much as 48% of their subsequent crying behavior at 6 weeks of life.Brain activation patterns to olfactory stimuli in colicky infants include not only primary olfactory areas but also brain regions involved in pain processing, emotional valence attribution, and self-regulation.This study links earlier findings in fields as diverse as gastroenterology and behavioral psychology and has the potential of helping healthcare professionals to define strategies to advise families. ¬© 2020, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.","Adam-Darque, A. and Freitas, L. and Grouiller, F. and Sauser, J. and Lazeyras, F. and Van De Ville, D. and Pollien, P. and Garcia-Rodenas, C.

11,Ecological momentary assessment of using food to soothe during infancy in the INSIGHT trial,"Background: Use of food to soothe infant distress has been linked to greater weight in observational studies. We used ecological momentary assessment to capture detailed patterns of food to soothe and evaluate if a responsive parenting intervention reduced parents' use of food to soothe. Methods: Primiparous mother-newborn dyads were randomized to a responsive parenting intervention designed for obesity prevention or a safety control group. Responsive parenting curriculum included guidance on using alternative soothing strategies (e.g., swaddling), rather than feeding, as the first response to infant fussiness. After the initial intervention visit 3 weeks after delivery, mothers (n = 157) were surveyed for two 5-8 day bursts at infant ages 3 and 8 weeks. Surveys were sent via text message every 4 h between 10:00 AM-10:00 PM, with 2 surveys sent at 8:00 AM asking about nighttime hours. Infant fusses and feeds were reported for each 4-h interval. Food to soothe was defined as ""Fed First"" and ""Not Fed First"" in response to a fussy event. Use of food to soothe was modeled using random-intercept logistic regression. Results: The control group had greater odds of having Fed First, compared to the responsive parenting group at ages 3 and 8 weeks (3 weeks: OR = 1.9","Adams, E. L. and Marini, M. E. and Brick, T.

13,Haemophilus meningitis in an African neonate: time for active surveillance and institution of appropriate control measure,"BACKGROUND: Childhood routine immunization in Nigeria, like most developing nations, do not include vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection. This is probably because infection with Hib is uncommon in children younger than two months due to passive acquisition of maternal antibodies which protects newborn till about four to six months of life. OBJECTIVE: To illustrate a case of neonatal meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae and to highlight its other peculiarities. METHODS: A 22-day old baby presented with excessive crying, refusal of feed, progressive abdominal distension, fever and vomiting. Besides clinical assessment, body fluids were cultured. RESULTS: The baby had tachypnoea (90 bpm), tachycardia (182 bpm), and tympanitic and hypoactive abdomen. The musculoskeletal and central nervous systems appeared clinically normal. Haemophilus influenzae was isolated by culture from the cerebrospinal fluid. The baby responded well to treatment with ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Neurological examination has remained normal after discharge for up to three months at follow-up visit. CONCLUSION: There is the need to provide serological and molecular facilities for typing Nigerian Haemophilus infulenzae strain(s) to enhance the development of appropriate vaccine that will be most suitable for prevention of infection due to this organism in Nigeria. However, presently available Haemophilus influenzae vaccine needs to be listed in the National Programme for Immunization (NPI) for the control of infections associated with this organism especially in childhood.","Adeboye, M.

15,Physical punishment and mental disorders: Results from a nationally representative US sample,"BACKGROUND: The use of physical punishment is controversial. Few studies have examined the relationship between physical punishment and a wide range of mental disorders in a nationally representative sample. The current research investigated the possible link between harsh physical punishment (ie, pushing, grabbing, shoving, slapping, hitting) in the absence of more severe child maltreatment (ie, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, emotional neglect, exposure to intimate partner violence) and Axis I and II mental disorders. METHODS: Data were from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions collected between 2004 and 2005 (N = 34 653). The survey was conducted with a representative US adult population sample (aged ‚â•20 years). Statistical methods included logistic regression models and population-attributable fractions. RESULTS: Harsh physical punishment was associated with increased odds of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug abuse/dependence, and several personality disorders after adjusting for sociodemographic variables and family history of dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio: 1.36-2.46). Approximately 2% to 5% of Axis I disorders and 4% to 7% of Axis II disorders were attributable to harsh physical punishment. CONCLUSIONS: Harsh physical punishment in the absence of child maltreatment is associated with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance abuse/dependence, and personality disorders in a general population sample. These findings inform the ongoing debate around the use of physical punishment and provide evidence that harsh physical punishment independent of child maltreatment is related to mental disorders.

18,The relationship between food insecurity and anthropometric measures at birth in low income households,"Background: Food security is one of the important factors that influence health and well-being throughout the life cycle. Objectives: This study aimed to determine the relationship between household (HH) food security status and anthropometric indices at birth and before 6-years-of age among children in a low income community in Mashhad city. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 240 Iranian HHs which had at least one under 6-year old child were selected through systematic cluster sampling. Height and weight of children were measured. Also, their length and weight at birth were collected from their vaccination certificate. Anthropometric status (based on z-scores) of children were evaluated by WHO Anthro-Plus software. Results: Severe, moderate, and mild food insecurity was observed in 7.1, 20, and 34.2% of the HHs, respectively. A significant association was observed between HH food insecurity and average height of their under 6-year-old children. There was no association between HH food insecurity and children‚Äôs measurements at birth (P > 0.05). Comparison of anthropometric status at birth and between 1 to 6 years of age in food secure and insecure groups based on Wilcoxon test, showed a significant difference between z-scores of weight for age (WAZ) and body mass index (BMI) for age (BAZ) in children from food insecure HHs. Conclusions: The results suggest that children in food insecure HHs do not necessarily have abnormal weight and length at birth, but growing up in a food insecure HH may lead to abnormal anthropometric status. Proper strategies to ensure food security in low income HHs may help to prevent child undernutrition. ¬© 2019, Author(s).","Ahmadihoseini, A. and Omidvar, N. and Nematy, M. and Safarian, M. and Salehi, M.",0,16
19,Probiotics for infantile colic,"Background: The prevalence of infant colic is high and it has a significant impact on the live of the infants and their families, given that effective treatment has not been found. Objective: The aim of this study to evaluate the effects of pedilact probiotic drops for the treatment of infants colic in children. Methods: This study was carried out on 72 infants, presented with infantile colic who were admitted to the Tehran children Medical Center. These children were assigned randomly (using 2 blinded-randomized trial) into two equal groups named PRR (Probiotic receiving) and PCR (Placebo receiving) groups. The demographic information of the infants such as age and sex, maternal age, patient admission time and confounding factors such as passive smoker, family history of atopy, antibiotic use, and delivery type was recorded in both groups based on the statements provided by the mothers. The weight of the infants was also recorded. Results: There was no significant difference in the distribution of infant's sex, mother's age, type of labor, type of nutrition, quality of life and exposure to smoke between the two groups. The weight of the newborns increased in each of the two groups and there was a significant increase in the PRR group (p value < 0.0001), while in the PCR group no significant growth was observed (p value = 0.437). The frequency of crying in both groups decreased over the time, which was significant in PRR group only (p value < 0.001). There were no significant difference between PRR and PCR groups in fecal consistency and pattern of sleep on each day of 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 (28 days p value = 0.475 and 0.086, respectively). Conclusion: Probiotic therapy significantly reduced the frequency and duration of crying and increased neonatal weight gain during the study, which can chiefly improve the quality of life. ¬© 2020 The Authors","Ahmadipour, S. and Fallahi, A. and Rahmani, P.",0,17

Methods: The double-blind randomised clinical trial was conducted from November 2014 to June 2017 at Kharadar General Hospital, Karachi, and comprised infants aged 0-6 months with infant colic, excessive crying lasting at least 3 hours a day on at least 3 days a week for at least 3 weeks. The subjects were randomised into intervention group A which received lactase enzyme Colibid, and placebo group B. Five drops of intervention preparation were received by all the infants before each feed for two weeks. Confidentiality of active agent and placebo was maintained through drug codes. The duration of crying was recorded at baseline then after first and second weeks of intervention. The two groups were compared with level of significance set at p<0.05. Results: There were 104 subjects with 52(50%) in each of the two groups Overall, 50(48.1%) were boys. At baseline, all (100%) the subjects had infant colic or excessive crying. After two-week intervention, significant improvement was seen in the duration of crying in group A 45(86.5%) compared to group B 31(59.6%) (p<0.05). Conclusion: Significant improvement was seen in the duration of crying in infants who received lactase enzyme supplement. ¬© 2018, Pakistan Medical Association.

21,Non-sucrose sweetener for pain relief in sick newborns,"A prospective controlled blind study was carried out in the Special Care Unit for Newborns to assess the effect of commercially available sweetener on pain relief in newborns. Response to intramuscular injection and the pain stimulus was studied in twenty-five sick newborns, 13 preterm and 12 term, in a blinded fashion. Pain score, duration of cry, heart rate and oxygen saturations were studied. Basal response, responses with sterile water or sweetener were recorded in each baby. Responses to sweetener versus no solution and sweetener versus sterile water were compared by applying paired t-test. The reduction in pain score with sweetener was significant when compared with no solution. The difference was not significant when compared with sterile water. Similarly, duration of cry and heart rate with sweetener were significantly less when compared to sterile water or to no solution. However, the difference in oxygen saturation was not significantly different. Sweetener has an analgesic effect in sick babies. This can minimise adverse effects associated with painful procedures.","Ahuja, V. K. and Daga, S. R. and Gosavi, D. V. and Date, A. M.",0,19
23,The excessively crying infant: Etiology and treatment,"Excessive crying, often described as infantile colic, is the cause of 10% to 20% of all early pediatrician visits of infants aged 2 weeks to 3 months. Although usually benign and self-limiting, excessive crying is associated with parental exhaustion and stress. However, an underlying organic cause is found in less than 5% of these infants. In the majority of cases, treatment consists not of ""curing the colic,"" although usually it is possible to reduce crying, but of helping the parents to get through this challenging period in their baby's development. The aims of this review are to discuss definition, etiology, and evaluate different treatment regimes in infants who cry excessively. ¬© Shutterstock.","Akhnikh, S. and Engelberts, A.

25,VCMNet: Weakly supervised learning for automatic infant vocalisation maturity analysis,"Using neural networks to classify infant vocalisations into important subclasses (such as crying versus speech) is an emergent task in speech technology. One of the biggest roadblocks standing in the way of progress lies in the datasets: The performance of a learning model is affected by the labelling quality and size of the dataset used, and infant vocalisation datasets with good quality labels tend to be small. In this paper, we assess the performance of three models for infant VoCalisation Maturity (VCM) trained with a large dataset annotated automatically using a purpose-built classifier and a small dataset annotated by highly trained human coders. The two datasets are used in three different training strategies, whose performance is compared against a baseline model. The first training strategy investigates adversarial training, while the second exploits multi-task learning as the neural network trains on both datasets simultaneously. In the final strategy, we integrate adversarial training and multi-task learning. All of the training strategies outperform the baseline, with the adversarial training strategy yielding the best results on the development set. ¬© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Al Futaisi, N.

35,Prenatal adversities and latino children's autonomic nervous system reactivity trajectories from 6 months to 5 years of age,"The purpose of the study was to determine whether mothers' adversities experienced during early pregnancy are associated with offspring's autonomic nervous system (ANS) reactivity trajectories from 6 months to 5 years of age. This cohort study of primarily Latino families included maternal interviews at 13-14 weeks gestation about their experience of a range of adversities: father's absence, general social support, poverty level, and household density. ANS measures of heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (parasympathetic nervous system) and preejection period (sympathetic nervous system) were collected during resting and challenging conditions on children at 6 months and 1, 3.5 and 5 years of age. Reactivity measures were calculated as the mean of the responses to challenging conditions minus a resting condition. Fixed effects models were conducted for the 212 children with two or more timepoints of ANS measures. Interactions between maternal prenatal adversity levels and child age at time of ANS protocol were included in the models, allowing the calculation of separate trajectories or slopes for each level of adversity. Results showed no significant relations between mothers' prenatal socioeconomic or social support adversity and offspring's parasympathetic nervous system trajectories, but there was a statistically significant relationship between social support adversity and offspring's heart rate trajectories (p<.05) and a borderline significant relationship between socioeconomic adversity and offspring's sympathetic nervous system trajectories (p = .05). Children whose mothers experienced one, not two, social support adversity had the smallest increases in heart rate reactivity compared to children whose mothers experienced no adversity. The children whose mothers experienced no social support and no socioeconomic adversity had the largest increases in heart rate and preejection period respectively from 6 months to 5 years showing the most plasticity. Mothers' prenatal adverse experiences may program their children's physiologic trajectory to dampen their heart rate or sympathetic responsivity to challenging conditions.","Alkon, A. and Boyce, W.

This study examined the impact of dietary patterns on body mass index (BMI) at 12 and 18 months. Methods We followed a cohort of 2666 children recruited in 2007-2008. Feeding practices were obtained from parental questionnaires and anthropometric data collected by child health nurses. Results At 6 months, 58.3% of the infant were breastfed, but only 1.6% exclusively. Many had begun eating solids (91.8%), porridge (87.7%) or milk cereal drink (46.6%). Bottle-feeding at 4 months was not a risk factor for a high BMI (>1 SD) at 12 or 18 months. Milk cereal drink at six months increased the risk of a high BMI at 12 and 18 months, respectively (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.12-2.22, and 1.52, 1.07-2.17). Milk cereal drink use was increased by low parental education and maternal obesity and reduced by troubled sleep and parental group participation. Conclusion Formula at 4 months did not predict a high BMI at 12 or 18 months. Milk cereal drink use at 6 months was a risk factor for a high BMI at 12 and 18 months. The choice of milk cereal drink was influenced by parental factors, especially educational levels. ¬©2013 Foundation Acta P√¶diatrica.

40,Three-Month Feeding Integration With Bifidobacterium Strains Prevents Gastrointestinal Symptoms in Healthy Newborns,"Infantile functional gastrointestinal disorders are common in the first months of life. Their pathogenesis remains unknown although evidences suggest multiple independent causes, including gut microbiota modifications. Feeding type, influencing the composition of intestinal microbiota, could play a significant role in the pathogenesis. Previous studies supported probiotic supplementation success against colics, however mainly Lactobacillus spp. were tested. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness against functional gastrointestinal disorders of a Bifidobacterium breve based probiotic formulation including in the study both breast-fed and bottle-fed subjects. Two hundred and sixty-eight newborns were enrolled within 15 days from birth. One hundred and fifty-five of them effectively entered the study and were randomized in probiotic and placebo group, receiving the formulation for 90 days. The probiotic formulation consists of a 1:1 mixture of 2 strains of B. breve prepared in an oily suspension and administered in a daily dosage of 5 drops containing 108 CFU of each strain. Absolute quantification of selected microbial groups in the faeces was performed using qPCR. Anthropometric data, daily diary minutes of crying, number of regurgitations, vomits and evacuations, and colour and consistency of stools were evaluated before and after treatment. The study confirmed the positive role of breast milk in influencing the counts of target microbial groups, in particular the bifidobacteria community. No adverse events upon probiotic administration were reported, suggesting the safety of the product in this regimen.

44,Hindmilk for procedural pain in term neonates,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether repeated doses of hindmilk were effective for pain relief during routine heel stick in term neonates. Infants enrolled in this double-blind placebo-controlled study were randomly assigned to hindmilk, 12.5% sucrose and distilled water groups. Infants were given 1 ml of the test solution 1 minute prior to, immediately before and 1 minute after the heel stick. Pain responses were assessed by physiologic and behavioral parameters and also according to the Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS). There were significant reductions in crying time, duration of the first cry and tachycardia, time needed for return to baseline heart rate, and the average and 1- and 5-minute NFCS scores in the hindmilk group when compared with the distilled water group. When the hindmilk group was compared to the sucrose group, only the NFCS scores at 1 and 2 minutes reached statistical significance in favor of the sucrose group. Repeated dose hindmilk administration is an effective analgesic intervention in term newborns during heel stick. Although the analgesic effect of 12.5% sucrose is slightly superior, hindmilk may be considered as a physiologically suitable alternative to sucrose.","Altun-K√∂roƒülu, O. and Ozek, E. and Bilgen, H. and Cebeci, D.",0,39

Infantile colic is a distressing and common condition for which there is no proven standard treatment. Objective. To compare the efficacy of Mentha piperita with simethicone in treatment for infantile colic. Methods. A double-blind crossover study was performed with 30 infants attending IMIP, Recife, Brazil. They were randomized to use Mentha piperita or simethicone in the treatment of infantile colic during 7 days with each drug. Primary outcomes were mothers opinion about responses to the treatment, number of daily episodes of colic, and time spent crying, measured by a chronometer. Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests were used to compare the results. This study was previously approved by the Ethical Committee in Research at IMIP. Results. At baseline daily episodes of infantile colic was 3.9 (1.1) and the mean crying time per day was 192 minutes (51.6). At the end of the study daily episodes of colic fell to 1.6 (0.6) and the crying duration decreased to 111 (28) minutes. All mothers reported decrease of frequency and duration of the episodes of infantile colic and there were no differences between responses to Mentha piperita and simethicone. Conclusions. These findings suggest that Mentha piperita may be used to help control infantile colic. However, these results must be repeated by others studies.

50,Leveraging electronic tablets for general pediatric care,"Background: We have previously shown that a scan-able paper based interface linked to a computerized clinical decision support system (CDSS) can effectively screen patients in pediatric waiting rooms and support the physician using evidence based care guidelines at the time of clinical encounter. However, the use of scan-able paper based interface has many inherent limitations including lacking real time communication with the CDSS and being prone to human and system errors. An electronic tablet based user interface can not only overcome these limitations, but may also support advanced functionality for clinical and research use. However, use of such devices for pediatric care is not well studied in clinical settings. Objective: In this pilot study, we enhance our pediatric CDSS with an electronic tablet based user interface and evaluate it for usability as well as for changes in patient questionnaire completion rates. Methods: Child Health Improvement through Computers Leveraging Electronic Tablets or CHICLET is an electronic tablet based user interface. It is developed to augment the existing scan-able paper interface to our CDSS. For the purposes of this study, we deployed CHICLET in one outpatient pediatric clinic. Usability factors for CHICLET were evaluated via caregiver and staff surveys. Results: When compared to the scan-able paper based interface, we observed an 18% increase or 30% relative increase in question completion rates using CHICLET. This difference was statistically significant. Caregivers and staff survey results were positive for using CHICLET in clinical environment. Conclusions: Electronic tablets are a viable interface for capturing patient self-report in pediatric waiting rooms. We further hypothesize that the use of electronic tablet based interfaces will drive advances in computerized clinical decision support and create opportunities for patient engagement. ¬© Schattauer 2015.","Anand, V. and McKee, S. and Dugan, T.

52,Current knowledge about skin-to-skin (kangaroo) care for preterm infants,"Skin-to-skin (""kangaroo"") care for preterm infants is becoming widespread in Western Europe. During this care the mother holds her diaper-clad premature infant against her skin beneath her clothing and allows self-regulatory access to breast-feeding. Fathers hold their infants skin-to-skin also. Research projects in Western Europe and the United States provide data that support the safety and effectiveness of this method. Infants held skin-to-skin are warm enough and have regular heart rate and respirations, more deep sleep and alert inactivity, less crying, no increase in infections, greater weight gain, and earlier discharge. Lactation is more productive and of greater duration. Parents become attached to their infants and feel confident about caring for them. This research is summarized and annotated in a table, along with descriptive reports and videotapes. These data can be used by health care professionals to make informed decisions about offering kangaroo care opportunities to selected parents and their preterm infants.","Anderson, G. C.",0,46
53,Infant temperamental factors as predictors of problem behavior and IQ at age 5 years: Interactional effects of biological and social risk factors,"Long term effects of infant temperament on problem behavior and cognitive abilities at age 5 yrs were investigated, taking into account interactions between infant temperament and biological and social risk. A total of 235 infants, of whom 52 were small-for-gestational age, were followed from birth. Their mothers completed the 6 and 13 mo versions of the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire, and rated behavior problems by completing the Personality Inventory for Children and the Yale Children's Inventory. Cognitive abilities were assessed with Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence --Revised (WPPSI--R) (IQ). Significant interactional effects were found for 13 mo ""unsociable"" temperament with biological risk and for 6 mo ""fussy-difficult"" temperament with social risk, both having adverse effects on child behavioral outcome. With regard to 13 mo ""persistent"" temperament, a significant interactional effect was found with biological risk having a negative effect on child IQ, and with social risk having a positive effect on child IQ. It is suggested that the effect of infant temperamental traits on later child adjustment should be assessed by taking into account other characteristics of the child and the child's environment.

57,Negative Temperament as a Moderator of Intervention Effects in Infancy: Testing a Differential Susceptibility Model,"A consideration of potential moderators can highlight intervention effects that are attenuated when investigating aggregate results. Differential susceptibility is one type of interaction, where susceptible individuals have poorer outcomes in negative environments and better outcomes in positive environments, compared to less susceptible individuals, who have moderate outcomes regardless of environment. In the current study, we provide rationale for investigating this type of interaction in the context of a behavioral childhood obesity preventive intervention and test whether infant negativity moderated intervention effects on infant self-regulation and weight gain and on two aspects of mothers‚Äô parenting competence: parenting self-efficacy and parenting satisfaction. Results showed that infants‚Äô negative temperament at 3¬†weeks moderated intervention effects on some, but not all, outcomes. The intervention led to greater parenting satisfaction in mothers with highly negative infants but did not affect parenting satisfaction in mothers with less negative infants, consistent with a model of differential susceptibility. There was also a trend toward less weight gain in highly negative intervention group infants. In contrast, there was a main effect of the intervention on infant self-regulation at 1¬†year, such that the intervention group had higher observed self-regulation, across levels of infant negativity. Results support the importance of incorporating tests of moderation into evaluations of obesity interventions and also illustrate that individuals may be differentially susceptible to environmental effects on some outcomes but not others. ¬© 2013, Society for Prevention Research.","Anzman-Frasca, S. and Stifter, C.

59,Association of late-onset postpartum depression of mothers with expressive language development during infancy and early childhood: The HBC study,"Background. While it has been implied that an infant's exposure to maternal post- partum depression (PPD) may be associated with delayed development of expressive language, it remains unclear whether such a delay persists into childhood and whether the onset of PPD onset-early (within 4 weeks after childbirth) vs. late (between 5 and 12 weeks postpartum)-is relevant in this context. Objective. To examine whether children of mothers with early- or late-onset PPD have reduced expressive language scores during infancy and early childhood (up to 40 months of age). Methods. This longitudinal, observational study was conducted as a part of the Hamamatsu Birth Cohort for Mothers and Children (HBC Study), a population- representative sample in Japan. A total of 969 neonates and their mothers were included in the analysis. Exposures. Early- and late-onset PPD was measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Main Outcomes and Measures. Expressive language development was measured using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Six points over time were monitored (10, 14, 18, 24, 32, and 40 months postpartum). The relationship between the exposure variable and any change in expressive language score was evaluated using multiple linear regression analysis and growth curve analysis, both adjusted for covariates. Results. Results from the adjusted regression analysis showed that children of mothers with late-onset PPD had significantly lower expressive language scores at 18 months of age and beyond, with a score reduction of approximately 0.6 standard deviations from the reference value at 40 months of age (95% CI [-0.888 to -0.265], p<:001). This association was confirmed on growth curve analysis, which revealed a significant, monotonic decline of expressive language development between 10 and 40 months of age among children of mothers with late-onset PPD, but not among children of mothers with early-onset PPD. Conclusion. Exposure to late-onset PPD may lead to a persistent decline in the rate of expressive language development in offspring during infancy and early childhood, highlighting the significance of monitoring for late-onset PPD to facilitate early detection and intervention. ¬© 2019 Aoyagi et al.","Aoyagi, S.

60,PH monitoring in the distal and proximal esophagus in symptomatic infants,"BACKGROUND: Standard distal esophageal pH monitoring data are sometimes within normal ranges in children with clinically suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that the amount of acid reflux reaching the proximal esophagus may be greater in some subgroups of patients than in healthy controls or in other subgroups of patients. METHODS: The parameters of 24-hour pH monitoring in the proximal part of the esophagus were analyzed in 120 symptomatic infants in who the reflux parameters in the lower esophagus were clearly within normal ranges (reflux index < 5.0%). The infants were classified into four patient groups: excessive regurgitation (n = 41): inconsolable crying (n = 31), apparent life-threatening event (ALTE) (n = 18), and chronic respiratory disorders (n = 30). The control group consisted also of 120 infants. The following parameters were calculated: reflux index, the number of reflux episodes, the number of reflux episodes lasting longer than 5 minutes, the duration of the longest reflux episode, and the acid clearance time (ACT, duration of reflux episodes divided by number of reflux episodes). RESULTS: The patients with chronic respiratory disorders were significantly older than the patients in the other groups and the controls. In the distal esophagus, there was no statistically significant difference between the reflux parameters. As could be expected, every parameter was statistically (paired t test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) significantly smaller in the proximal than in the distal esophagus, except for the ACT in infants who presented with inconsolable crying. In the proximal esophagus, there was no statistically significant difference between the different patient subgroups or controls, except for the number of reflux episodes in the group with chronic respiratory disorders and the group with inconsolable crying, applying one-way analysis of variance. As determined by applying the Mann-Whitney test, the number of reflux episodes in the upper esophagus was significantly higher in the group with chronic respiratory disorders than in the other patient groups and controls. Therefore, the authors' data do not support the hypothesis that reflux reaching the proximal esophagus is a frequent cause of ALTE. However, the data may suggest that the number of reflux episodes reaching the proximal esophagus in children with chronic respiratory disorders and with distal pH monitoring data within normal ranges may be increased. Whether this finding reflects reality or a statistical coincidence, or is influenced by the older age of this patient group, needs further evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: In theory, dual simultaneous esophageal pH monitoring in the distal and proximal esophagus may increase the diagnostic accuracy of pH monitoring in infants. Our results do not support a substantial advantage of a systematic application of this new technique, especially not in infants presenting with ALTE, excessive regurgitation, or inconsolable crying. In the subgroup of patients with chronic respiratory disorders, more data are needed before conclusions can be determined and recommendations can be made.","Arana, A. and Bagucka, B. and Hauser, B. and Hegar, B. and Urbain, D. and Kaufman, L. and Vandenplas, Y.",0,52

To asses the effectiveness of an outpatient-based individualised behaviour modification programme to modify children's sleep behaviour and to decrease levels of maternal distress and depression. METHOD: Families were referred to an outpatient childhood sleep problems clinic. Intervention consisted of an individualised management programme including recognised modes of child sleep behaviour management ('controlled crying', 'cold turkey,' rewards) together with occasional use of short-term (less than 2 weeks) tapering dose sedating medication for the child. Two months after the initial contact with the clinic, families completed a second questionnaire collating similar data to that collected at time of enrolment. RESULTS: A total of 114 consecutive families referred to the clinic provided initial data. Follow-up questionnaires were returned by 70 (61%). Significant change was recorded in children's sleep parameters including reduction in mean number of night time awakenings (4.1-1.3, P < 0.001), proportion of children requiring longer than 30 min to settle at night (49% to 21%, P < 0.01) and in the proportion of children settling after 8 pm (51% to 33%, P < 0.01). Sleep problem rating on a 0-10 scale decreased from a mean of 8.1-3.1 (P < 0.001). On initial assessment, 40% of mothers had Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPNDS) scores greater than 12 (screening cut-off point). At repeat assessment, 4.3% had scores greater than 12. The mean score on the EPNDS fell from 11.2 to 5.8 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An outpatient-based individualised approach to modifying children's problematic sleep behaviour using recognised behaviour management techniques is effective. Modification of problematic childhood sleep behaviour is associated with significant improvement in maternal mood. Given the high incidence of childhood sleep problem and diagnosed postnatal depression, it is likely significant numbers of mothers being diagnosed as having postnatal depression are suffering the effects of chronic sleep deprivation. Management of postnatal mood disorder and childhood sleep behaviour must occur with due recognition to their close association.","Armstrong, K. L. and Van Haeringen, A. R. and Dadds, M.

68,Behavioral sleep cycles in the human newborn,"Studied the behavioral sleep cycles of a group of 22 normal full-term neonates. Consistent sleep cycles were found in all Ss, but the 1st epoch of active sleep following feeding was found to be curtailed as compared with later epochs. There was a significant correlation between the weight of the Ss and quiet sleep epoch durations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Ashton, R.",0,55
69,State and the auditory reactivity of the human neonate,"Examined the auditory responsivity of 17 3-5 day old babies by the use of square wave auditory stimuli 2 sec. In duration and presented at 85 db. 4 different frequencies of the stimuli were employed: 75, 95, 115, and 135 hz. And the behavioral reactivity of the ss was monitored by simple observation. The neonate was found to be most responsive during the state of alertness and least responsive during either quiet sleep or crying. Paradoxically, the neonate was differentially sensitive to different frequencies of auditory stimuli only during quiet sleep (p < .05). Results are explained on the basis of the hypothesis that during alertness and active sleep the cns of the neonate is swamped by the intense stimulation, while during quiet sleep the low level of reactivity enables the neonate to respond differentially to stimuli presented at different frequencies. The importance of the stimulus and response parameters when making statements about the reactivity of the human neonate is stressed.

73,Sleep disruption in young children: The influence of temperament on the sleep patterns of pre-school children,"Examined the role of temperament (specifically, behavior difficulties) on sleep problems in 57 12‚Äì36 mo olds with and without sleep problems. Parents completed a 2-part questionnaire which consisted of a 12-item questionnaire focusing on environmental factors and the Toddler Temperament Scale. Parents also participated in a structured interview which used the Southampton Sleep Clinic Management Interview Questionnaire. Results revealed a positive correlation between ""difficult"" temperament profiles and sleep problems. A significant correlation existed between sleep problems and the child falling asleep in a location somewhere other than his/her own bed. Parental handling also appeared to influence sleep problems in children. Responsiveness seems to be a contributing factor in that parents who respond to their child's cries may be inadvertently positively reinforcing the child's pattern of waking.

74,Infant motor activity during sleep: Simultaneous use of two actigraphs comparing right and left legs,"Motor asymmetry during the first hours of sleep documented in adults found higher activity in the non-dominant limb. The stage of development at which such asymmetries first appear is unknown. Twenty healthy infants were followed from 7 to 12 months of age, at 3-week intervals, comparing motor activity of the right and left legs during sleep using twin actigraphs (AMI). Hour-by-hour analysis of the first seven hours of nocturnal sleep found no consistent difference in activity levels between the right and left legs. Using the standard algorithm for infants, which provides an overall estimate of sleep quality, revealed discrepancies in night waking episodes (Right versus Left) in 33% of the nights. Results pertaining to leg movement suggest that motor asymmetry is not yet present during the first year of life. However, given the large discrepancies in the detection of night waking, further investigation of the developmental course of circadian motor asymmetry is warranted. ¬© 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Atun-Einy, O. and Tonetti, L. and Boreggiani, M. and Natale, V. and Scher, A.",0,59

The unique and interactive contributions of a maternal dopamine receptor gene (DAT1), maternal ADHD symptoms (hyperactive- impulsive, inattentive), and home atmosphere to the prediction of ADHD symptoms (hyperactive- impulsive, inattentive) in 7- year-old boys (N¬†=¬†96) were examined using data from a longitudinal study of familial risk for ADHD. During the first 6¬†months of the study, mothers and their spouses completed a questionnaire about the mother‚Äôs ADHD symptoms. Home atmosphere questionnaire data were collected 4¬†years later. At the 7-year assessment, mothers reported on their child‚Äôs ADHD symptoms. Negative home atmosphere was significantly associated with child hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive symptoms. Maternal inattentive symptoms were significantly correlated with both child symptom dimensions. Regression models, with child genotype and maternal education controlled, showed main effects for maternal inattentive symptoms, maternal DAT1 10/10 genotype, and home atmosphere in the prediction of child inattentive symptoms. Only home atmosphere predicted child hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. There was a significant home atmosphere x maternal hyperactive-impulsive symptoms interaction in the prediction of child hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Boys with higher levels of symptoms came from homes characterized by higher levels of negative atmosphere and had mothers with higher levels of hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. There was also a trend (p¬†=¬†0.075) for a maternal DAT1 x home atmosphere interaction. Boys with higher levels of inattentive symptoms came from homes with higher levels of negative atmosphere and had mothers with the homozygous 10/10 genotype.

80,Cumulative risks and cessation of exclusive breast feeding: Australian cross-sectional survey,"Objectives To estimate the prevalence of cessation of exclusive breast feeding at each month up to 6 months and document key factors and cumulative risks associated with exclusive breastfeeding cessation for children aged from 0 to 6 months. Methods Secondary analysis using a national representative sample of 22 202 mother and infant pairs derived from the 2010 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare cross-sectional survey, the Australian Infant Feeding Survey. Results Among breastfed infants, 49% had ceased exclusive breast feeding before they had reached 2 months of age. In the final Cox proportional hazards model, cessation of exclusive breast feeding was most strongly associated with partners preferring bottle feeding (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.69 to 20.6) or having no preference (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.42), regular dummy use (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.39) and maternal obesity (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.35). Living within the most disadvantaged areas of Australia (quintile 1) was not strongly associated with cessation (HR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.14) compared with least disadvantaged areas. Having three risk factors significantly increased the risk of cessation by 31% (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.6). Conclusions The prevalence of early cessation of exclusive breast feeding is alarmingly high with 50% of infants no longer exclusively breast fed by age 2 months. Given that not one factor is associated with cessation of exclusive breast feeding, the greatest public health impact is likely to be achieved when multiple risk factors are modified or prevented.","Ayton, J. and Van Der Mei, I. and Wills, K. and Hansen, E. and Nelson, M.",0,64

84,The calming effect of maternal breast milk odor on premature infants,"BACKGROUND: To compare the effectiveness of maternal breast milk odor and formula milk odor in soothing premature infants undergoing heel lancing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty preterm infants born between 32 weeks and 37 weeks gestation were randomly assigned into two groups. During heel lancing, we used formula milk odor for the first group and breast milk odor for the second group. A filter paper (containing either formula or breast milk) was placed near the infant's nose from 3 minutes prior to and up to 9 minutes after the heel blood sampling. The pain score was measured using premature infant pain profile (PIPP) score. We also evaluated crying duration and salivary cortisol prior to and after heel lancing. RESULTS: After the heel lancing, the PIPP score was found to be significantly lower in the breast milk group than the formula milk group (5.4 compared to 9 with p < 0.001). Also, the level of salivary cortisol had significantly increased in the formula milk group, but not in the breast milk group (25.3 nmol/L compared to 17.7 nmol/L (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Breast milk odor has an analgesic effect in preterm newborns and can be used as a safe method for pain relief.","Badiee, Z. and Asghari, M. and Mohammadizadeh, M.",0,66
85,Cobedding of twin premature infants: calming effects on pain responses,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this trial was to determine whether cobedding of preterm twins has analgesic effects during heel lancing or not. METHODS: One hundred premature twins (50 sets) born between 26 weeks' and 34 weeks' gestation undergoing heel blood sampling were randomly assigned into two groups: the cobedding group (receiving care in the same incubator) and the standard care group (receiving care in separate incubators). Pain was assessed using the premature infant pain profile score. Duration of crying was measured after heel blood sampling, and salivary cortisol was measured prior to and after heel blood sampling. RESULTS: Infants in the standard care group cried for a longer time during heel lancing than those in the cobedding group (42.6 ¬± 19.8 seconds vs. 36.4 ¬± 21.7 seconds, p = 0.03). The mean premature infant pain profile score after heel lancing was significantly higher in the standard care group (9.8 ¬± 2.6 vs. 8.06 ¬± 2.8, p = 0.002). The mean salivary cortisol after heel lancing was also significantly higher in the standard care group (24.3 ¬± 7.4 nmol/L vs. 20.8 ¬± 7.4 nmol/L, p = 0.02). No significant adverse effects were seen with cobedding. CONCLUSION: Cobedding is a comforting measure for twin premature infants during heel lancing, which can be performed without any significant adverse effects.","Badiee, Z. and Nassiri, Z. and Armanian, A.",0,67
86,Gastro-oesophageal reflux in infancy,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is a common phenomenon in infants, which may occur with or without accompanying symptoms. Although most infants presenting with regurgitation have a normal physical examination, it is now recognized that infants may also present with a wide variety of symptoms. Oesophagitis is associated with increased oesophageal acid exposure. The determination of cause and effect is difficult, as there are many aspects of reflux disease where cause and effect relationships are cyclic. Reflux disease is present when there is an imbalance between a number of factors that can contribute to a decrease, as well as an increase, of GOR. Oesophageal pH monitoring with a semi-disposable monocrysant antimony pH catheter with three sensors is very good at documenting oesophageal acidification and gastric buffering and, therefore, quantifies acid reflux frequency and duration. However, the interpretation of the data is complex as they are influenced by numerous factors, such as position, activity (sleep, crying), feeding (frequency and composition) or medication. The duration of buffering of gastric acidity during pH monitoring might, in the future, appear to be a relevant factor in the interpretation of oesophageal pH data.","Badriul, H. and Vandenplas, Y.",0,68
87,Infant colic or early symptom of autism spectrum disorder?,"Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Infant colic (IC), the functional GI disorder of infancy, has not been evaluated in this patient group. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the rate of IC in ASD and investigate a possible association between ASD and IC. Methods: The subjects consisted of 100 ASD patients (mean age, 6.6 ¬± 3.5¬†years) and 100 healthy controls (mean age, 5.3 ¬± 2.8¬†years). The parents were questioned using the diagnostic criteria for infant colic for clinical research purposes defined in Rome IV to diagnose IC, retrospectively. The sample size was estimated using a maximum type I error probability of 5% (alpha) and a type II error of 20%. Results: The rate of IC was 16% and 17% in the ASD group and control group, respectively (P ÀÉ 0.05). Excessive crying with late onset and long duration in infants was defined as persistent crying. The rate of persistent crying was significantly higher in the ASD group than in the control group (32% vs 9%, P < 0.001). The relative risk of persistent crying was 4.40 in ASD. The likelihood of being misdiagnosed with IC in this group was 78%. Conclusion: The rate of IC is not increased in patients with ASD, but infants with excessive crying should be very thoroughly evaluated before being diagnosed with IC. In particular, persistent crying in infants (i.e. excessive crying with late onset and long duration) may be an early symptom of ASD. ¬© 2018 Japan Pediatric Society","Baƒü, √ñ and Al≈üen G√ºney, S. and Cevher Binici, N. and Tuncel, T. and ≈ûahin, A. and Berksoy, E. and Ecevit, √á",0,69

The mean number of crying episodes reduced from 4.4 at six weeks to 1.5 at one year. Early crying predicted later crying. It was not possible to predict which babies would cry a lot except that breast‚Äêfed infants tended to cry less. Mothers' perceptions of whether their babies cried a lot correlated with their perception of sleep difficulties. Rapid response to crying, was associated with significantly less crying overall.

95,Positive parenting approaches and their association with child eating and weight: A narrative review from infancy to adolescence,"Parents play a critical role in the development of children's eating behaviours and weight status, serving as providers, models and regulators of the food environment. Many research reviews have focused on the robust body of evidence on coercive control in feeding: how parenting practices such as restriction and pressure to eat increase children's risk for developing undesirable eating behaviours and unhealthy weight outcomes. Fewer reviews adopt a strengths-based perspective focusing on the ways that parents can actively support the development of healthy eating behaviours and weight trajectories. Emerging research on such positive parenting styles and practices offers solutions beyond the avoidance of coercive control, as well as opportunities to highlight parallels between research on food parenting and the broader, well-established developmental literature on positive parenting. The focus of this review is to summarize what is known regarding benefits of positive parenting styles and practices for child eating and weight outcomes and discuss recommendations for future research. Current evidence supports starting with responsive feeding and parenting during infancy and incorporating structure and limit setting in early childhood, with monitoring and mealtime structure remaining important during middle childhood and adolescence. Areas for future research include: (1) further examination of the implications of identified food parenting practices and styles among diverse groups and caregivers","Balantekin, K.

97,Toward an Integrated Anthropology of Infant Sleep,"This article provides a novel synthesis of anthropological research on infant sleep, focusing on work in biological and sociocultural anthropology in the past decade. First, we briefly review early biological anthropological research into infant sleep from 1987 to 2007, which provided the evidence base for the argument that proximate parent‚Äìinfant sleep combined with lactation represents a complex set of adaptations that constitute the human evolutionary norm. This work challenged the Western pediatric infant sleep research paradigm, which positioned formula- or bottle-fed solitary sleeping infants as the basis for research and universal models about human infant sleep. Next, we address how recent research has built on these foundations and extended anthropological insights into new aspects of infant sleep. Biological anthropologists, who continue to lead this research, have advanced into the hormonal and behavioral ecology of parent‚Äìinfant sleep and trade-offs in nighttime care and parent‚Äìinfant conflict. Moreover, they have made significant progress in translating anthropological research into policy and practice in clinical and health delivery settings. Until recently, sociocultural anthropology has primarily addressed infant sleep as part of broader endeavors, without an explicit focus on infant sleep. We highlight key ethnographic works that shed light on the cultural normalcy and interembodied experience of shared maternal‚Äìinfant sleep with breastfeeding that help de-center Western discourses of infant sleep. We conclude by discussing future research agendas to forward an integrated anthropology of human infant sleep that considers its full biological and sociocultural context. Integrated anthropological approaches to infant sleep not only present a path forward for novel cross-subfield anthropological research but could help guide more effective and equitable approaches to maternal-infant health.

99,Parental and health professional evaluations of a support service for parents of excessively crying infants,"Background: The 'Surviving Crying' study was designed to develop and provisionally evaluate a support service for parents of excessively crying babies, including its suitability for use in the United Kingdom (UK) National Health Service (NHS). The resulting service includes three materials: a website, a printed booklet, and a Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) programme delivered to parents by a qualified professional. This study aimed to measure whether parents used the materials and to obtain parents' and NHS professionals' evaluations of whether they are fit for purpose. Parents were asked about participating in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the materials fully in health service use. Methods: Participants were 57 parents with babies they judged to be crying excessively and 96 NHS Health Visitors (HVs). Parental use and parents' and HVs' ratings of the Surviving Crying materials were measured. Results: Thirty four parents reported using the website, 24 the printed booklet and 24 the CBT sessions. Parents mostly accessed the website on mobile phones or tablets and use was substantial. All the parents and almost all HVs who provided data judged the materials to be helpful for parents and suitable for NHS use. If offered a waiting list control group, 85% of parents said they would have been willing to take part in a full RCT evaluation of the Surviving Crying package. Discussion and conclusions: The findings identify the need for materials to support parents of excessively crying babies within national health services in the UK. The Surviving Crying support package appears suitable for this purpose and a full community-level RCT of the package is feasible and likely to be worthwhile. Limitations to the study and barriers to delivery of the services were identified, indicating improvements needed in future research. Trial registration: Study Registration no.

100,"Maternal nutritional status & practices & perinatal, neonatal mortality in rural Andhra Pradesh, India","BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Despite a vast network of primary health centres and sub-centres, health care outreach in rural parts of India is poor. The Dangoria Charitable Trust (DCT), Hyderabad, has developed a model of health care outreach through trained Village Health and Nutrition Entrepreneur and Mobilisers (HNEMs) in five villages of Medak district in Andhra Pradesh, not serviced by the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) of the Government of India. Impact of such a link worker on perinatal/ neonatal mortality has been positive. The present study attempts to examine the association of maternal nutrition and related factors with perinatal, and neonatal mortality in these villages. METHODS: Women from five selected villages who had delivered between June 1998 and September 2003, were identified. Those who had lost a child before one month (28 days), including stillbirths, (group 1- mortality group), who could be contacted and were willing to participate, were compared with those who had not lost a child (group II- no mortality), through a structured questionnaire and physical examination for anthropometric status and signs and symptoms of nutritional deficiency. Categorical data were analysed using Pearson chi square analysis. Continuous data were analysed using Student's t test. RESULTS: Mortality during perinatal, neonatal period was 8.2 per cent of all births. Malnutrition was rampant. Over 90 per cent women had 3 or more antenatal check-ups, had taken tetanus injections and had complied with regular consumption of iron-folic acid tablets. Higher percentage of women in group I (mortality group) tended to have height less than 145 cm (high risk) and signs and symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies. However, differences between groups I and II were not statistically significant. Pre-term delivery, difficult labour (use of forceps), first parity, birth asphyxia (no cry at birth) and day of initiating breastfeeding showed significant association with mortality. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Significant association between signs and symptoms of malnutrition with perinatal, neonatal deaths may have been masked by high prevalence of malnutrition in the mothers of both the groups and the small study sample size. However, maternal malnutrition, may contribute indirectly through its effects on other pregnancy-related as well as delivery-related complications leading to adverse outcome of pregnancy. The HNEM experience of DCT suggests that a properly trained and supported village level worker can contribute to reduction in perinatal and neonatal mortality.","Bamji, M. S. and PV, V. S.

102,"Attitude, beliefs and practices of some Nigerian nurses toward teething in infants","The objective of this study was to assess the perceptions of some Nigerian nurses on the various societal beliefs about teething. A cross sectional survey was conducted among 542 nurses in the teaching, general and Local Government hospitals and clinics in Ibadan, a city in south western Nigeria. The outcome of the study revealed that the majority of the nurses believed that loss of appetite, crying, increased salivation and general irritability were a necessary part of the teething process. Furthermore, 82,1%, 61,4% and 27,9 % of them implicated fever, diarrhoea and boils respectively as signs of teething. The older and more experienced nurses and males seemed to ascribe symptoms more with the teething process. From this study, it is clearly evident that there are erroneous beliefs concerning teething persistent among Nigerian nurses. Since the societal beliefs may be harmful to the health of the children, there is a desperate need to address them. In doing this, a health education programme should be formulated to educate these misconceptions among the general public and especially target older and more experienced nurses as well as the males.

103,Review of sn-2 palmitate oil implications for infant health,"Human milk provides the optimal balanced nutrition for the growing infant in the first months after birth. The human mammary gland has evolved with unusual pathways, resulting in a specific positioning of fatty acids at the outer sn-1 and sn-3, and center sn-2 of the triacylglyceride, which is different from the triglycerides in other human tissues and plasma. The development of structured triglycerides enables mimicking the composition as well as structure of human milk fat in infant formulas. Studies conducted two decades ago, together with very recent studies, have provided increasing evidence that this unusual positioning of 16:0 in human milk triglycerides has a significant role for infant health in different directions, such as fat and calcium absorption, bone health, intestinal flora and infant comfort. This review aims to unravel the relevance of human milk triglyceride sn-2 16:0 for intestinal health and inflammatory pathways and for other post-absorption effects. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Bar-Yoseph, F. and Lifshitz, Y. and Cohen, T.",0,81
104,Palmitic acid in infant nutrition,"Human breast milk provides the optimum nutrition for infants. Designed to provide balanced nutrition, human breast milk naturally meets the needs of growing infants in the first months after birth. In human breast milk, and in most infant formulas, approximately 50% of the energy is supplied to newborns as fat, of which more than 98% is in the form of triglycerides. Triglyceride synthesis occurs in the mammary gland. The fatty acids are specifically positioned to sn1, sn2 or sn3 positions on the glycerol backbone to yield the structure-specific triglycerides that are found in human milk. Palmitic acid (C16:0) is the predominant saturated fatty acid, comprising 17-25% of the fatty acids in mature human milk. Surprisingly, the positioning of palmitic acid is highly conserved across populations, and approximately 70-75% of palmitic fatty acids are esterified to the sn2 position of the triglyceride (sn2 palmitate). Clinical and pre-clinical studies over the last three decades have provided increasing evidence that this specific positioning of palmitic acid on the triglycerides in human milk has a significant holistic effect on optimal infant development and well-being that is related to the increased absorption of both palmitic acid and calcium: softer stools, increased bone strength, increased beneficial gut flora, controlled intestinal health, and reduced infant crying. All of these contribute to the benefits of infant wellbeing. The overall aim of the current review is to expand the understanding of the role of palmitic acid and its specific sn2 position in infant nutrition. ¬© 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

105,Clinical signs of dysphagia in infants with acute viral bronchiolitis,"Objective: To determine the occurrence of clinical signs of dysphagia in infants with acute viral bronchiolitis, to compare the respiratory parameters during deglutition, and to ensure the intra- and inter- examiners agreement, as well as to accomplish intra and interexaminators concordance of the clinical evaluation of the deglutition. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 42 infants aged 0-12 months. The clinical evaluation was accompanied by measurements of respiratory rate and pulse oximetry. A score of swallowing disorders was designed to establish associations with other studied variables and to ensure the intra- and interrater agreement of clinical feeding assessments. Caregivers also completed a questionnaire about feeding difficulties. Significance was set at p<0.05. Results: Changes in the oral phase (prolonged pauses) and pharyngeal phase (wheezing, coughing and gagging) of swallowing were found. A significant increase in respiratory rate between pre- and post-feeding times was found, and it was determined that almost half of the infants had tachypnea. An association was observed between the swallowing disorder scores and a decrease in oxygen saturation. Infants whose caregivers reported feeding difficulties during hospitalization stated a significantly greater number of changes in the swallowing evaluation. The intra-rater agreement was considered to be very good. Conclusions: Infants with acute viral bronchiolitis displayed swallowing disorders in addition to changes in respiratory rate and measures of oxygen saturation. It is suggested, therefore, that infants displaying these risk factors have a higher probability of dysphagia. ¬© 2014 Sociedade de Pediatria de S√£o Paulo. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

106,Effects of starting weaning exclusively with vegetables on vegetable intake at the age of 12 and 23 months,"Background: The low vegetable intake in children may be attributed to their low preference for vegetables. During the first year of life, first taste preferences are formed, which may track over time. In a previous study to increase infants' vegetable intake and liking, we found that at the start of weaning, infants had a higher vegetable intake in the lab after repeated exposure to vegetable pur√©es than to fruit pur√©es. The current study is a follow-up of these infants at the age of 12 and 23 months, and examined whether the group that started weaning with vegetables continued eating more vegetables than the group that started weaning with fruits. Methods: At 12 (n = 86) and 23 (n = 81) months of age the children's daily vegetable consumption was reported by their parents using a 3-day food diary. The intake of green beans and apple pur√©e was measured in the laboratory. Results: Reported daily intake of vegetables at 12 months of age was 38 % higher (P = 0.02) in the vegetable group (75 ¬± 43 g) than in the fruit group (54 ¬± 29 g), but was similar for both groups at 23 months of age (49 ¬± 43, 57 ¬± 35 g, respectively","Barends, C. and de Vries, J.

110,"Latch on or back off?: Public health, choice, and the ethics of breast-feeding promotion campaigns","Policies to promote breast-feeding often engender substantial controversy. While clearly involving disagreement over the appropriate limits to government authority, this controversy also reflects a related disagreement over whether infant-feeding practices are a public health matter or a private choice. Infant feeding practices are both a personal choice warranting some deference by the state yet also a legitimate target of public health intervention. Evaluating the ethics of breast-feeding policy thus requires navigating this complex duality, a duality mirrored by healthy eating policies that aim to increase consumption of healthier foods and decrease consumption of less-healthy foods. Examining the analogies and disanalogies with healthy eating policies can illuminate important ethical complexities of breast-feeding policy.","Barnhill, A. and Morain, S. R.",0,86
111,The early crying paradox - A modest proposal,"In contemporary Western societies, infants in the first 3 months cry more than at any other time during their life. Although this crying is believed to function to assure nutrition, protection, and mother-infant interaction thought to be essential for later attachment, it also predisposes to complaints of excessive crying (""colic""), discontinuing breast-feeding, and, in the extreme case, child abuse. A resolution of this apparent paradox is proposed based on evidence that elements of caregiving are important determinants of some aspects of early crying. It is argued that early human crying under caretaking conditions typical in Western societies is characterized by prolonged crying bouts, that it is specifically the length of crying bouts (rather than frequency or pattern) that is affected by caregiving practice, and that prolonged crying bouts are probably not characteristic with caretaking practices typical in non-Western societies and possibly in our evolutionary past. It is suggested that caregiving behaviors may recruit normal physiological functions that potentiate cry bout duration in Western caregiving contexts, but reduce it in others. Frequent, short bouts are sufficient, and probably better suited than long bouts, to promote all the positive and presumably adaptive functions claimed for infant crying. Furthermore, they may have provided a mechanism by which infants could enhance their own fitness. ¬© 1990 Walter de Gruyter, Inc.","Barr, R. G.",0,87

114,Mother and child: Preparing for a life,"In trying to understand what helps the lives of human infants get off to a good start, we have concentrated on the quite remarkable and particular relationship that occurs between mothers and their infants in the first few days and weeks of life. Of course, everyone is interested in mother-infant relationships, but the word ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù can take on many meanings. For most, the term conjures up a picture of a mother lovingly holding her infant in her arms, perhaps in anen face position in which they are looking directly into each other's eyes. The assumption is that this is a manifestation of a maternal nature of loving and supportive caring that the mother is hardwired to provide. However, in Sarah Blaffer Hrdy's thoughtful critique (Hrdy, 1999), she challenges the assumption that there is any such thing as an ‚Äúessential‚Äù mothering nature. She argues that mothering, as with many other aspects of animal behavior, is subject to choices (or trade-offs) that may differ depending on the experiences and contexts in which mothering is taking place. If Hrdy's position is correct, then the implications for understanding what gets the lives of human infants off to a good start are enormous. Among other things, the argument implies that good mothering is not guaranteed, but rather that it is contingent on a variety of factors, only some of which we know very much about. ¬© Cambridge University Press 2011.","Barr, R.

116,Crying patterns in preterm infants,"Healthy infants born at term cry most in the first three months of life, with a peak and increased crying in the evening during the second month. To determine whether the crying of preterm infants manifests similar features, the pattern of crying from 40 weeks gestational age through 24 weeks corrected age was described for 35 relatively healthy preterm infants born between 28 and 34 weeks gestational age. Despite their additional extra-uterine experience, they still cried significantly more after 40 weeks gestational age, with a peak and evening clustering at 6 weeks corrected age. The age of peak crying was not related to gestational age at birth, weight for gestational age, or a variety of perinatal and neurological indices. The results support the argument that the early-peak pattern is a robust maturational feature of early development and may be universal to human infancy.","Barr, R.

Despite markedly different caretaking practices predisposing to quieter infants, crying and fretting were significantly greater during the first three months, and a peak pattern was present. Measurement of crying ‚Äòintensity‚Äô indicated that it was predominantly short and fretful. The results support the concept that the early peak pattern is not specific to infants in western industrialized societies, and may represent a behavior universal to the human species. The caretaking differences between societies primarily appear to affect crying duration rather than its frequency and pattern in early infancy.

To understand what is meant by the descriptions of crying and fussing in the diaries, the diaries of 10 mothers of 6 week old infants were compared with tape recordings of vocalisations made by the babies over a 24 hour period. There were moderately strong correlations between the frequency of episodes (clusters of 'negative vocalisations') on the audiotape and episodes of 'crying and fussing' in the diaries, and between the duration of episodes on the audiotape and episodes of 'crying' in the diaries. To assess the acceptability of the diaries for recording information for clinical and epidemiological research, they were then used in a population study of a wide socioeconomic group. Usable data were obtained from 91% of the sample. The results suggest that despite pronounced differences between recording methods, these diaries may provide valid and useful reports of crying and fussing in the short term.","Barr, R.

121,Feeding and temperament as determinants of early infant crying/fussing behavior,"In the first 3 months of life, crying and fussing in normal infants tend to increase until 6 weeks of age and decrease progressively thereafter. To determine whether feeding choice and early infant temperament are predictors of early crying, 374 healthy, full-term infants were observed prospectively from birth to 6 weeks of age. Feeding choice and sociodemographic characteristics were ascertained in the first few days postpartum. Parents completed a 17-item early infant temperament questionnaire at 2 weeks of age and a 24-hour behavior diary for 8 days at 6 week of age. Initially breast-fed infants cried and fussed more frequently throughout 24 hours compared with those who were formula fed, and increased frequency and duration of crying and fussing were predicted by 'more difficult' temperament. Furthermore, a different pattern of crying and fussing within the day was found for infants who were changed from breast- to formula feeding. However, according to stepwise multiple regression models, daily duration of crying/fussing was significantly predicted only by the temperament score (but not initial feeding choice), which accounted for 7% of the variance. Frequency of crying/fussing were predicted only by socioeconomic status, temperament, and feeding frequency, which accounted for 12% of the variance. Breast- or formula feeding at 6 weeks of age was independently associated with crying/fussing only during the evening. It was concluded that early infant temperament predisposes to early crying and fussing but is of limited use as a clinical predictor. Later crying/fussing behavior is not predicted by initial feeding. However, the pattern of duration of crying/fussing appears to change following a change from breast to formula, which may account for the presumed effectiveness of this maneuver.","Barr, R.

Six-week-old infants were also given sucrose and water after feeding. For the newborn infants, the calming effect was rapid, substantial and lasted for at least four minutes. Mouthing and hand-mouth contact increased, but for shorter durations. For the six-week-old infants, sucrose calmed for one minute only before feeding, but had no effects on mouthing or hand-mouth contact. The results imply that intra-oral sucrose has acute age-related effects on crying and suckling-feeding behaviour mediated by a pre-absorptive mechanism. Sucrose may tap a functional system for reducing distress related to feeding and/or regulation of infant state.","Barr, R. G. and Quek, V. S. and Cousineau, D. and Oberlander, T. F. and Brian, J.

128,Differential calming responses to sucrose taste in crying infants with and without colic,"BACKGROUND: Colic is a behavioral syndrome of early infancy of unknown etiology whose core symptom is increased crying. Both clinical anecdotal descriptions and controlled observations converge in suggesting that a defining characteristic of the crying behavior is the longer duration of the crying bouts, especially during the second month of life when colic is at its peak. This implies that, once infants with colic begin crying, they do not calm as well as infants without colic. To investigate this difference objectively, we used response to sucrose taste as a probe of colic-normal differences in regulation of crying for three reasons. First, sucrose taste has been shown to be a potent regulator of crying in human newborns. Second, convergent evidence from studies in both nonhuman and human infants suggests that sucrose calming reflects the function of central distress regulatory systems that are opioid-dependent. Third, effectiveness of sucrose calming diminishes in normal infants by 4 to 6 weeks of age, consistent with the developmental increase in crying duration common to infants with and without colic. Consequently we predicted that, if the regulation of crying by sucrose taste is relevant to the crying of infants with colic, calming responses to sucrose taste should be less effective in 6-week-old infants with colic compared with those without. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical observation that infants with and without colic differ in their ability to regulate their crying behavior, our primary objective was to determine if there were differential crying responses to intraoral sucrose tastes (relative to water) in crying infants with and without colic. Based on previous studies of calming responses to sucrose taste, it was predicted that sucrose-specific calming before a feeding would be less effective in infants with colic than in those without. A secondary and more exploratory aim was to assess calming responses to sucrose (relative to water) on spontaneous crying after a feed in both groups. METHODS: Nineteen infants meeting modified Wessel's criteria for colic were compared with 19 age- and sex-matched normal infants without colic in a within-subject controlled observation of calming and mouthing responses to both intraoral sucrose and water tastes. Both before and after two feedings on the same day, each infant was observed until she or he cried continuously for 15 consecutive seconds, at which time three 250-microL tastes of 48% sucrose solution or sterile water were administered 30 seconds apart, and infant responses videotaped. Outcome measures derived from second-by-second coding of the videorecordings were percent time crying per minute for 4 minutes and percent time mouthing per minute for 2 minutes after stimulus administration. RESULTS: As predicted, the crying of infants with colic was less affected than the crying of infants without colic after sucrose but not water tastes before feedings. After feedings, the crying of infants with colic was less affected than the crying of infants without colic for both sucrose and water tastes, and sucrose was more effective than water in both groups of infants. These calming differences could not be attributed to differences in mouthing responses because the calming effects persisted after mouthing ceased, and there were no differences in mouthing responses between groups before or after feedings. CONCLUSIONS: As in newborns, a significant calming effect of sucrose taste that persisted beyond the cessation of mouthing could be elicited in crying 6-week-old infants, but it required a stronger taste stimulus to do so. As predicted, infants with colic were less effectively calmed by sucrose taste than infants without. These differential effects could not be accounted for by differences in crying when the stimulus was applied or by differences in mouthing behavior. Before a feed, these differences in calming were specific to sucrose taste. After a feed, infants with c","Barr, R. G. and Young, S. N. and Wright, J. H. and Gravel, R. and Alkawaf, R.",0,100
129,Contributions of nonmaternal caregivers to infant feeding in a low-income African-American sample,"Infant feeding is a well-established topic of interest in obesity research, yet few studies have focused on contributions of nonmaternal caregivers (NMCs)‚Äîsuch as fathers, grandparents, and daycare providers‚Äîto infant feeding. Data from the Infant Care, Feeding and Risk of Obesity Project in North Carolina were used to investigate (a) which factors were associated with NMC feeding styles and (b) how NMCs' and mothers' feeding styles compared. Multivariate regression models utilizing random effects were used to analyse data from 108 NMCs who were identified by mothers as being heavily involved in infant feeding. Feeding styles were measured using the Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire. Several individual characteristics were important. Higher laissez faire-attention scores were reported by men and NMCs who lived in the same household as infant. Men reported higher indulgent-coax and indulgent-pamper scores. Perceptions of fussier infants, older infant age, and higher infant weight-for-length z-scores were also important. Mothers' and NMCs' feeding styles differed. Compared with mothers, grandparents reported lower laissez faire and indulgent-permissive scores. Fathers reported higher pressure-soothe and indulgent scores. Daycare providers reported higher restriction-diet quality and responsive satiety. Feeding styles were also predicted to change over time for all caregiver types. These findings highlight the importance of helping all caregivers develop skills that will promote optimal infant feeding outcomes. Given the paucity of research in this area, it is important to improve our understanding of what influences caregivers' feeding styles, especially among diverse populations, and how exposure to different feeding styles may shape children's obesity risk. ¬© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Barrett, K.

130,Babies in boxes and the missing links on safe sleep: Human evolution and cultural revolution,"Concerns about bedsharing as a risk for sudden infant death syndrome and other forms of sleep-associated infant death have gained prominence as a public health issue. Cardboard ‚Äúbaby boxes‚Äù are increasingly promoted to prevent infant death through separate sleep, despite no proof of efficacy. However, baby boxes disrupt ‚Äúbreastsleeping‚Äù (breastfeeding with co-sleeping) and may undermine breastfeeding. Recommendations enforcing separate sleep are based on 20th century Euro-American social norms for solitary infant sleep and scheduled feedings via bottles of cow's milk-based formula, in contrast to breastsleeping, an evolutionary adaptation facilitating the survival of mammalian infants for millennia. Interventions that aim to prevent bedsharing, such as the cardboard baby box, fail to consider the implications of evolutionary biology or of ethnocentrism in sleep guidance. Moreover, the focus on bedsharing neglects more potent risks such as smoking, drugs, alcohol, formula feeding, and poverty. Distribution of baby boxes may divert resources and attention away from addressing these other risk factors and lead to a false sense of security wherein we overlook that sudden unexplained infant deaths also occur in solitary sleep environments. Recognizing breastsleeping as the evolutionary and cross-cultural norm entails re-evaluating our research and policy priorities, such as providing greater structural support for families, supporting breastfeeding and safe co-sleeping, investigating ways to safely minimize separation for formula-fed infants, and mitigating the potential harms of mother‚Äìinfant separation when breastsleeping is disrupted. Resources would be better spent addressing such questions rather than on a feel-good solution such as the baby box. ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Bartick, M. and Tomori, C. and Ball, H. L.",0,102

134,Measurement of infant difficultness,"( The following abstract of this reprinted article originally appeared in PA, Vol 63:2366.) The Infant Characteristics Questionnaire (ICQ) was developed as a short, factor-analytic screening device for difficultness. Responses of 322 mothers of 4‚Äì6 mo old infants suggested that they regard the fussy, hard-to-soothe, labile infant as difficult. Mother reports on the ICQ, particularly on the main fussy-difficult factor, had adequate reliability over time and convergence with the Survey of Temperamental Characteristics (designed by W. B. Carey, 1973) with father report on the ICQ, and to a lower degree with home data collected by independent observers. Results also show that mother characteristics may affect perceptions of infant difficultness: Multiparous, extraverted mothers tended to rate their infants as easy.

135,Dimensions of individuality in the mother‚Äìinfant relationship at six months of age,"Collected data on 168 mother‚Äìinfant pairs using measures such as the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment Inventory, Infant Characteristics Questionnaire, Personality Research Form, and Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID). Results show a widely generalizable dimension in maternal behavior of warm, responsive interaction with the infant. Some elements of this main factor overlapped with another factor indexing the extent to which mother impressed observer as educationally stimulating. Social class was associated with this teaching factor but not with the more affection- and play-oriented dimension. Mother perceptions of difficult temperament in the infant were associated with objectively observed crying and fussing but were essentially independent of the major dimensions of maternal behavior. Observed active and happy behaviors of the infant were somewhat related to normative status on the BSID, but neither active and happy behavior nor BSID score correlated with the important dimensions of maternal behavior.

136,Measuring Stress in Young Children Using Hair Cortisol: The State of the Science,"Extensive literature suggests that adverse experiences in early childhood may deleteriously impact later health. These effects are thought to be related to the impact of persistent or chronic stress on various biological processes, mediated by dysregulation of the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal (HPA) axis, and ultimately irregularities in cortisol levels. Ameliorating persistent stress in young children requires accurately measuring the chronicity of physiologic stress, which is difficult in young children because of unreliable self-report and the burden and inaccuracy associated with using invasive acute-stress biomeasures. A better way to approximate persistent stress in young children is measuring hair cortisol concentration (HCC), as it only requires one noninvasive collection to measure months of HPA-axis activity or experienced stress. However, few studies measure HCC in young children despite wide use in adult stress research. This article reviews and synthesizes research that uses HCC to approximate persistent stress in healthy children, 12‚Äì60 months of age. Reviewed studies indicate that HCC is elevated in young children who are experiencing forms of persistent stress such as low socioeconomic status and maternal distress. Hair cortisol is thus a promising measure of early childhood persistent stress, but due to the limited use of HCC in this population, much research is still needed. Specifically, nurse researchers may need to measure several factors associated with early childhood persistent stress and HCC to identify which children are at risk for stress-related disease. ¬© 2017, ¬© The Author(s) 2017.","Bates, R. and Salsberry, P. and Ford, J.",0,107
137,Intrathecal neostigmine with bupivacaine for infants undergoing lower abdominal and urogenital procedures: dose response,"BACKGROUND: Intrathecal (IT) neostigmine produces dose-dependent analgesia in adults. However, the dose of spinal neostigmine has not been investigated in infants. The purpose of this study was to assess spinal anesthesia (SA) duration provided by four doses of spinal neostigmine added to bupivacaine for lower abdominal and urogenital procedures in infants. METHODS: Seventy-five infants were randomized into five groups. The control group B received IT plain 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. Groups BN.25, BN.50, BN.75, and BN1.0 received bupivacaine with 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 microg/kg of neostigmine, respectively. The primary variable was the duration of anesthesia assessed by recovery of hip flexion. Postoperative pain with facial expression, leg activity, arm activity, crying and consolability scale score, and rescue analgesic requirements were the secondary variables measured, and the side effects were noted. RESULTS: Seventy-three infants completed the study. There was a significant linear increase in SA duration with IT neostigmine to 65.2 (4.3) min with 0.5 microg/kg (P<0.01), 88.2 (5.1) with 0.75 microg/kg (P<0.001) and 92 (4.3) with 1 microg/kg (P<0.001) from 52.4 (4.3) min with bupivacaine alone. SA duration showed no significant difference between plain bupivacaine and BN.25 (P=0.100) or between groups BN.75 and BN1.0 (P=0.451). Groups BN.75 and BN1.0 had significantly reduced pain scores, and the median duration before the first dose rescue analgesic was requested prolonged significantly (P<0.001) compared with the other three groups. CONCLUSIONS: IT neostigmine at a dose of 0.75 microg/kg added to bupivacaine significantly prolonged SA duration with reduced postoperative pain scores and rescue analgesic requirements in infants undergoing lower abdominal and urogenital procedures. No additional benefits were provided on increasing it to 1 microg/kg.","Batra, Y. K. and Rajeev, S. and Panda, N. B. and Lokesh, V. C. and Rao, K. L.",0,108
138,The factors affecting neonatal presentations to the pediatric emergency department,"BACKGROUND: A pediatric emergency department (PED) may be utilized by neonates for nonurgent complaints. Various factors, such as primiparity, maternal age, early postnatal discharge, race, income, and maternal and paternal educational levels, have been reported to affect the acuity of neonatal emergency department utilization. OBJECTIVE: To determine the characteristics of PED visits by neonates (infants ‚â§ 28 days of age) and to evaluate the factors affecting the acuity of these visits. METHODS: We prospectively collected the data of neonates who were admitted to the PED of a tertiary university hospital within a 6-month period. Presenting problems were classified as acute if diagnostic tests were requested or the patient was hospitalized, unless the final diagnosis was ""normal newborn."" RESULTS: Over this period, 28,389 children (0-18 years of age) visited the PED, of which 531 were newborns (1.9%). The mean age was 14.1 ¬± 8.3 days, with a slight predominance of males (57.3%). The chief complaints were jaundice (23.4%), irritability (9.5%), and vomiting (7.1%), and the most common diagnoses were normal newborn (33.9%), indirect hyperbilirubinemia (13.2%), and colic (5.8%). Acute visits were 55.7% of the total visits. Premature infants, infants of multiparous mothers, infants of older mothers (‚â•25 years), and physician-referred infants were more likely to present with acute problems (p values were 0.001, 0.013, 0.006, and <0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there may be a relationship between nonacute neonatal visits to a PED and insufficient knowledge of the caretaker on newborn care. Thus, more detailed education and early postnatal support programs regarding newborn care may help to decrease nonacute PED visits by neonates.","Batu, E. D. and Yeni, S. and Teksam, O.",0,109
139,Analgesic Effect of Maternal Human Milk Odor on Premature Neonates: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Two studies have demonstrated an analgesic effect of maternal milk odor in preterm neonates, without specifying the method of olfactory stimulation. Research aim: This study aimed to assess the analgesic effect of maternal milk odor in preterm neonates by using a standardized method of olfactory stimulation. METHODS: This trial was prospective, randomized, controlled, double blinded, and centrally administered. The inclusion criteria for breastfed infants included being born between 30 and 36 weeks + 6 days gestational age and being less than 10 days postnatal age. There were two groups: (a) A maternal milk odor group underwent a venipuncture with a diffuser emitting their own mother's milk odor and (2) a control group underwent a venipuncture with an odorless diffuser. The primary outcome was the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) score, with secondary outcomes being the French scale of neonatal pain-Douleur Aigu√´ du Nouveau-n√© (DAN) scale-and crying duration. All neonates were given a dummy. RESULTS: Our study included 16 neonates in the maternal milk odor group and 17 in the control group. Neonates exposed to their own mother's milk odor had a significantly lower median PIPP score during venipuncture compared with the control group (6.3 [interquartile range (IQR) = 5-10] versus 12.0 [IQR = 7-13], p = .03). There was no significant difference between the DAN scores in the two groups ( p = .06). Maternal milk odor significantly reduced crying duration after venipuncture (0 [IQR = 0-0] versus 0 [IQR = 0-18], p = .04). CONCLUSION: Maternal milk odor has an analgesic effect on preterm neonates.","Baudesson de Chanville, A. and Brevaut-Malaty, V. and Garbi, A. and Tosello, B. and Baumstarck, K. and Gire, C.",0,110

It is unclear, however, whether these behavioral and emotional problems persist into adulthood. The default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) support both interoceptive regulation and social and emotional abilities. We thus hypothesized that adults who had experienced RPs in infancy have more behavioral and emotional problems, which are mediated by DMN and/or SN alterations.

Little is known about the nutritional health of young children receiving care at Canadian Community Health Centres (CHCs). Our objectives were to describe iron deficiency among toddlers at an Ontario CHC, to compare young children attending CHCs and non-CHCs, and assess the feasibility of conducting research on children in CHC settings. Methods: One CHC, Kingston Community Health Centres (CHC) with two clinical sites and one community programming site was added to the nine non-CHC pediatric and primary care clinics in the existing TARGet Kids! research network. A cross-sectional feasibilitystudy was conducted.and. Healthy children, ages 12-36 months were Enrolled. iron deficiency without inflammation (ferritin< 14 Œºg/L and CRP < 10 mg/L) and serum ferritin were assessed. Adjusted multivariable regression analyses were used to evaluate an association between CHC enrolment and iron status. Results: The CHC cohort (n = 31) was older, had lower household income, lower maternal education, higher nutrition risk scores, higher cow's milk intake, shorter breastfeeding duration and higher prevalence of unhealthy weights compared with the non-CHC cohort (n = 875). There was no association between CHC status and serum ferritin (difference in median serum ferritin 4.78 Œºg/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.5, 14.3, p = 0.22) or iron deficiency (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.11, - 2.73, p = 0.46) using multivariable linear and logistic regression, respectively. Conclusion: Despite differences in sociodemographic variables, we did not detect a difference in iron status between toddlers enrolled at CHCs compared to non-CHC settings. Further research is needed to understand the health effects of poverty generally, and iron deficiency specifically among children receiving care at CHCs. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","Bayoumi, I. and Parkin, P.

149,Screening for retinopathy of prematurity: is it painful?,"BACKGROUND: Screening programmes for retinopathy of prematurity have shown to reduce unfavourable visual outcome and to be cost-effective. Following present recommendations, almost 1% of all newborn babies should therefore be screened and undergo at least one ophthalmologic examination. This is a skilled procedure that requires drug instillation and manipulation of the ocular globe with scleral indentation. The objective of this study is to describe the side effects of this ophthalmic exam with special focus on the occurrence of pain. METHODS: This was an observational study with a before-after analysis where all neonates undergoing an ophthalmologic exam during a 4-month period in a third level hospital were included. CRIES pain score was determined before the exam, 5 min after and 24 h after the screening manoeuvre. Blood pressure and pulse rate were determined in addition to the mentioned measurements 30 min after the ophthalmologic examination. Minimum oxygen saturation, apnoeas, gastrointestinal side effects (like vomiting and gastric aspirates), the need for respiratory assistance or for intensive care unit admission were recorded within 24 h before and after the procedure. RESULTS: 27 preterm neonates underwent an ophthalmologic examination and were included in the study. CRIES pain score was significantly higher 5 min after and 24 h after the screening procedure than before. This difference was also observed after stratification for birth weight and gestational age. No other study variable modified this time effect. No significant changes in blood pressure and pulse rate were shown after the ophthalmic exam. Vomiting was present in 4% of the newborns, gastric aspirates in 22% and apnoeas in 41% after the examination. Ten percent of the explored preterm babies needed increased respiratory assistance and 4% had to be transferred from the intermediate care unit to the intensive care because of severe apnoeas. COMMENTS: An increase in pain score was shown after retinopathy of prematurity screening examination. Physiologic variable changes do not last long enough to evaluate the impact of certain procedures. Multivariate pain scores (like CRIES) should be used in everyday practice. It seems that the ophthalmologic examination in preterm babies might be painful and further studies should identify the best strategy to prevent pain during the retinopathy of prematurity screening manoeuvre.","Belda, S. and Pall√°s, C.

153,Diabetes in non-hispanic white youth,"OBJECTIVE - To investigate the incidence, prevalence, and clinical characteristics of diabetes among U.S. non-Hispanic white (NHW) youth. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Data from the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study (SEARCH study), a multicenter study of diabetes among youth aged 0-19 years, were examined. Incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 person-years across 4 incident years (2002-2005), and prevalence in 2001 was calculated per 1,000 youths. Information obtained by questionnaire, physical examination, and blood and urine collection was analyzed to describe the characteristics of youth who completed an in-person visit. RESULTS - The prevalence of type 1 diabetes (at ages 0-19 years) was 2.00/1,000, which was similar for male (2.02/1,000) and female (1.97/1,000) subjects. The incidence of type 1 diabetes was 23.6/100,000, slightly higher for male compared with female subjects (24.5 vs. 22.7 per 100,000, respectively, P = 0.04). Incidence rates of type 1 diabetes among youth aged 0-14 years in the SEARCH study are higher than all previously reported U.S. studies and many European studies. Few cases of type 2 diabetes in youth aged <10 years were found. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (at ages 10-19 years) was 0.18/1,000, which is significantly higher for female compared with male subjects (0.22 vs. 0.15 per 1,000, P = 0.01). Incidence of type 2 diabetes was 3.7/100,000, with similar rates for female and male subjects (3.9 vs. 3.4per 1,000, respectively, P = 0.3). High levels of abnormal cardiometabolic and behavioral risk factor profiles were common among youth with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. For example, within each of four age-groups for youth with type 1 diabetes and two age-groups for youth with type 2 diabetes, >40% had elevated LDL cholesterol, and <3% of youth aged > 10 years met current recommendations for intake of saturated fat. Among youth aged ‚â• 15 years, 18% with type 1 and 26% with type 2 diabetes were current smokers. CONCLUSIONS - The SEARCH study is one of the most comprehensive studies of diabetes in NHW youth. The incidence of type 1 diabetes in NHW youth in the U.S. is one of the highest in the world. While type 2 diabetes is still relatively rare, rates are several-fold higher than those. ¬© 2009 by the American Diabetes Association.","Bell, R. A. and Mayer-Davis, E. J. and Beyer, J.

154,Infant crying and maternal responsiveness,"Conducted a naturalistic, longitudinal study of 26 middle-class white infant-mother pairs. Results show that consistency and promptness of maternal response was associated with decline in frequency and duration of infant crying. By the end of the 1st yr. individual differences in crying reflected the history of maternal responsiveness rather than constitutional differences in infant irritability. Close physical contact was the most frequent maternal intervention and the most effective in terminating crying. Nevertheless, maternal effectiveness in terminating crying was found to be less powerful than promptness of response in reducing crying in subsequent months. Evidence suggests that whereas crying is expressive at first, it can later be a mode of communication directed specifically toward the mother. Development of noncrying modes of communication, as well as a decline in crying, is associated with maternal responsiveness to infant signals. Findings are discussed in an evolutionary context, and with reference to the popular belief that to respond to his cries spoils a baby. (22 ref.)

158,Are pacifiers associated with early weaning from breastfeeding?,"BACKGROUND: The pacifier, a non-nutritive sucking device, is commonly used for calming infants. The World Health Organization/United Nation's Children's Fund (WHO/UNICEF) Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative recommends avoiding pacifiers in breastfed term infants because it is thought to lead to early weaning. Most studies that found early weaning to be associated with pacifier use were observational in design. This Critically Appraised Topic evaluates a randomized controlled trial that examines pacifiers and early weaning. PURPOSE: The objectives of the study analyzed were to test whether regular pacifier use has a causal effect on early weaning from the breast by 3 months of age and to assess the difference in results when the data are examined using randomized intervention allocation (intention to treat) versus observational use of pacifiers. METHODS: Two hundred eighty-one breastfeeding women and their healthy term infants were allocated randomly to 1 of 2 counseling interventions. Both groups received basic breastfeeding promotion information. In addition, the experimental group mothers (n = 140) were asked to avoid pacifiers and were given other alternatives for comforting a crying infant. Logs detailing infant crying, fussing, and pacifier use were completed at 4, 6, and 9 weeks of age, and an interview at 3 months determined the duration of breastfeeding. RESULTS: The experimental group had a higher rate of total avoidance of pacifier use (38.6% v 16% in the control group) and less daily use of pacifiers (40.8% v 55.7%). When the data were analyzed based on the intention to treat (randomized allocation), the experimental intervention group had similar rates of early weaning as the control group (18.9% v 18.3%). When the data were analyzed on the treatment given (ignoring randomization), a strong observational association was found between daily exposure to pacifiers and weaning by 3 months (25% v 12.9% of exposed versus unexposed groups). CONCLUSION: The results imply that pacifier use may be a marker of breastfeeding difficulties or decreased maternal motivation to breastfeed, as opposed to being the causal agent in early weaning.","Benis, M.

159,Associations between maternal and paternal feeding styles of infants in a racially diverse US birth cohort,"Background: Maternal feeding style has been associated with childhood obesity and has been the target of numerous interventions, but few studies included fathers. Objectives: We assessed correlations and associations between maternal and paternal feeding style. Methods: We examined 202 mothers, fathers, and infants in Nurture, a racially diverse US cohort (2013-2017). Mothers and fathers completed the Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire when infants were 6 and 12 months. We examined unadjusted correlations using Spearman's Rho and adjusted associations using linear regressions. Results: All feeding styles were significantly correlated. After adjustment, maternal feeding style was associated with paternal feeding style at 6 and 12 months for responsive (√ü 0.31","Benjamin-Neelon, S. E. and Neelon, B.",0,128
160,What patterns of postpartum psychological distress are associated with maternal concerns about their children's emotional and behavioural problems at the age of three years?,"Mothers experiencing psychological distress in the postpartum period may have difficulties parenting their children. Inconsistent and unresponsive parenting may increase the risk of later emotional and behavioural problems in children. The purpose of this study was to identify how maternal psychological characteristics cluster at eight weeks postpartum, and whether these clusters were associated with maternal-reported child emotional and behavioural problems at the age of three years, as measured by the Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS) questionnaire. In a longitudinal pregnancy cohort (N = 647), three clusters of postpartum psychological characteristics were identified.

162,The relationship of temperament and stranger reaction for younger and older infants,"The relationship between temperament, as proposed by A. Thomas and S. Chess (1977), and reaction to strangers was tested in a cross-sectional study of 60 5‚Äì9 mo old infants. Ss were administered the Infant Temperament Questionnaire, and stranger reaction was assessed during 3 standard approaches by a female adult stranger in the lab. Correlations (pooled for age) between the temperament scores and the reactions to stranger ratings confirm the hypothesis that temperamentally fussy infants show more fearful reactions to strangers than do more easy-going infants. ANOVAs, however, suggested that these fussy infants were less friendly and more fearful of strangers only at the older ages (8 and 9 mo). At the younger ages, the fussy infants were generally comparable to the easy-going infants. It is suggested that relationships between infant temperament and behavior may be more apparent in situations of relative stress than under less stressful circumstances.

164,Differences in early risk factors for obesity between African American formula-fed infants and White breastfed controls,"Background: Previous RCTs to prevent early rapid weight gain were conducted in predominantly White, well-educated, middle-income mother-infants at low risk for obesity. To inform the design of an RCT in a higher-risk sample, we conducted a short-term, longitudinal study to compare maternal feeding beliefs and behaviors, infant sleep, intake, and growth of African American formula feeding (AAFF) dyads to a comparison sample of White breastfeeding (WBF) dyads. We also assessed the feasibility of recruiting and retaining AAFF participants. Methods: AAFF (n = 32) and WBF (n = 25) mother-infants were assessed at 2, 8, and 16 weeks postpartum. Data included demographics and maternal reports of feeding beliefs and behaviors, infant sleep, meal size, and feeding frequency, and measured infant length and weight. Results: AAFF and WBF mothers differed in demographics. AAFF mothers reported greater agreement with pressuring the infant to eat and feeding to soothe a fussy infant. Compared to WBF infants, AAFF infants slept fewer hours and consumed more grams/feeding from 2 to 16 weeks. There were no group differences in feeding frequency, which resulted in AAFF infants consuming more grams/day of milk than WBF infants. AAFF infants had lower gestational age, lower weight at 2 weeks, and had more rapid weight gain from 8 to 16 weeks. Conclusions: Findings point to potentially modifiable risk factors that may underlie disparities in early obesity among AAFF infants, including short sleep duration, feeding beliefs and behaviors, and rapid growth, but also confirm the challenges of recruiting and retaining AAFF participants, all of which inform the design and feasibility of an early preventive intervention. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).","Berger, P.

166,Reducing maternal depressive symptoms through promotion of parenting in pediatric primary care,"We studied associations between 2 pediatric primary care interventions promoting parental responsiveness and maternal depressive symptoms among low-income mothers. This randomized controlled trial included 2 interventions (Video Interaction Project [VIP], Building Blocks [BB]) and a control group. VIP is a relationship-based intervention, using video-recordings of mother-child dyads to reinforce interactional strengths. BB communicates with parents via parenting newsletters, learning materials, and questionnaires. At mean (SD) child age 6.9 (1.2) months, depressive symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), parental responsiveness was assessed with StimQ-I. A total of 407 dyads were assessed. Rates of mild depressive symptoms were lower for VIP (20.6%) and BB (21.1%) than Controls (32.1%, P =.04). Moderate depressive symptoms were lower for VIP (4.0%) compared to Controls (9.7%, P =.031). Mean PHQ-9 scores differed across 3 groups (F = 3.8, P =.02): VIP mothers scored lower than controls (P =.02 by Tukey HSD). Parent-child interactions partially mediated VIP-associated reductions in depressive symptoms (indirect effect -.17, 95% confidence interval -.36, -.03). ¬© The Author(s) 2014.","Berkule, S.

Both spanking and verbal punishment varied by maternal race/ethnicity. Child fussiness at age 1 predicted spanking and verbal punishment at all 3 ages. Cross-lagged path analyses indicated that spanking (but not verbal punishment) at age 1 predicted child aggressive behavior problems at age 2 and lower Bayley mental development scores at age 3. Neither child aggressive behavior problems nor Bayley scores predicted later spanking or verbal punishment. In some instances, maternal race/ethnicity and/or emotional responsiveness moderated the effects of spanking and verbal punishment on child outcomes. ¬© 2009, Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.","Berlin, L.

Mothers of 65 infants completed a sleep diary when infants were aged 1¬†year, and children completed two subscales of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence at 4¬†years, indexing general cognitive ability and complex executive functioning. Consistent with hypotheses, children getting higher proportions of their sleep at night as infants were found to perform better on executive functions, but did not show better general cognition. Relations held after controlling for family socioeconomic status and prior cognitive functioning. These findings suggest that the special importance of sleep for higher order cognition, documented among adults, may appear very early in life. ¬© 2013 The Authors ¬© 2013 Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.","Bernier, A. and Beauchamp, M.

The authors assessed sleep regulation through a parent sleep diary when children were 12 and 18 months old (N = 60). Child EF was assessed at 18 and 26 months of age. Higher proportions of total sleep occurring at night time, at both 12 and 18 months, were related to better performance on executive tasks, especially those involving a strong impulse control component. Most relations held above family socioeconomic status, prior mental development and concurrent verbal ability. These findings add to previous results with school age children in suggesting that sleep favors the development of higher order cognitive functions requiring prefrontal cortex involvement. ¬© 2010 The Authors.

172,Awareness of abusive head trauma in a German population-based sample: implications for prevention,"BACKGROUND: Despite efforts to reduce the incidence of abusive head trauma (AHT), incidence rates remain high. One cause is that prevention programs mostly aim to educate mothers of newborns on AHT and infant crying. However, mothers commonly have already a high knowledge and constitute only a minority among identified AHT perpetrators. The hypothesis was that there are great differences in AHT awareness in different subgroups. To assess awareness of AHT, a population-based study was performed. METHODS: A population-based representative sample of the German population aged >14 years (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ2510) was assessed in a cross-sectional observational survey. The sample was selected in a random route approach between November 2017 and February 2018. RESULTS: Overall knowledge of AHT was higher in women (67.9%) than in men (48.8%, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). Female gender, having children, higher age, and level of education were predictors for the awareness of AHT. A majority of participants reported to have heard about AHT from the media. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of AHT differs significantly within the population. In groups at higher risk to perpetrate AHT, including men, young caregivers, and those with low educational level, awareness of AHT was low. These subgroups should be targeted by tailored education programs for prevention.","Berthold, O. and Clemens, V. and Witt, A. and Br√§hler, E. and Plener, P. L. and Fegert, J. M.",0,139
173,Do we get the message through? Difficulties in the prevention of abusive head trauma,"Many programs aim to prevent abusive head trauma throughout the USA, Europe, and in many other regions of the world. Most of these programs inform mothers shortly after delivery about the dangers of abusive head trauma. Effectiveness of these programs usually is measured by the increase of knowledge on abusive head trauma. Recent research showed, however that for effective primary prevention, a much broader approach might be necessary. But so far, there is no data that reports the knowledge on key messages on abusive head trauma in the general public as a baseline. We conducted a representative population-based survey on abusive head trauma knowledge in Germany. Whereas the dangers are generally well known, a majority might be ambivalent towards the recommendation to leave a crying infant alone for a few minutes when the caregiver becomes too stressed or frustrated. Furthermore, a majority prefers being informed on abusive head trauma before birth.Conclusion: Future preventive programs should focus on educating adolescents (potential baby sitters) and young adults when they do not yet have children of their own. What is known: ‚Ä¢ Most programs for primary prevention of abusive head trauma (AHT) focus on mothers shortly after delivery ‚Ä¢ There are no analyses so far of the quality of education programs in the general public, as educating mothers might not be sufficient to reduce incidence rates What is new: ‚Ä¢ Our study is the first population-based survey to measure the knowledge on AHT in a representative population sample and to provide the data base for targeted prevention programs. ‚Ä¢ The introduction of broader prevention programs might be necessary.","Berthold, O. and Witt, A. and Clemens, V. and Br√§hler, E. and Plener, P.

175,Prevalence and determinants of the use of pacifiers and feedingbottle: A study in Southwest Bahia,"Objectives: to assess the use of pacifier and feedingbottle and their determinants in children from a municipality of Southwest Bahia. Methods: a cross-sectional study was performed with 354 children younger than 12 months old. The event was categorized in: exclusive use of pacifier, exclusive use of feeding bottle,use of pacifier and feeding bottle, and not use any of them. Multinomial analysis with logistic regression was applied, and those who did not use any artificial nipples were theref-erence variable. Results: it was observed that 11.9% of the children exclusively used pacifiers, 21.2% only use bottles and 32.8% used both of them. The following factors were associated with the exclusive use of pacifiers: low maternal schooling level (eight or less years of education), lack of previous experience with breastfeeding, difficulty in postpartum breastfeeding, and lack of incentive to breastfeeding in puericulture. The exclusive use of feeding bottle was associated with unmarried mothers, aged 35 years old or older, and with less years of education (eight or less years). Women who worked outside home and had difficulty in breast-feeding had greater chance of giving both artificial nipples to the children.

177,Early neonatal Glutaric aciduria type I hidden by perinatal asphyxia: a case report,"BACKGROUND: Perinatal asphyxia (PA) occurs in about 2 to 10 per 1000 live full-term births. Although neonatal epileptic seizures are observed in up to 60% of cases, PA may mimic or subtend other conditions. Hypoxia related brain injury is particularly relevant, as it may have permanent effects on neuropsychomotor development. Antepartum obstetric conditions, may, in turn, lead to hypoxic-ischemic damage to the fetus and the newborn, often underlying PA. Herein, a case of PA that hid and triggered signs and symptoms of Glutaric Aciduria type I (GA-I), is reported. CASE PRESENTATION: R.F. was born at term after prolonged labour, by induced vaginal delivery with the Kristeller manoeuvre. He presented with severe asphyxia and asystoly. Immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation promptly restored cardiorespiratory parameters, allowing for early extubation 30¬†min after. During the following hours, severe axial muscle hypotonia with an increased tone of the limb extensor muscles became evident. The absence of crying and archaic reflexes persisted and there was an onset of generalized tonic or clonic seizure. First level metabolic and inflammatory markers were within the normal range. An inherited metabolic disease was then suspected, due to the persistent clinical signs of severe neurological damage without any detectable septic parameter. GA-I was assessed and specific treatment started without any clinical improvement, although ensuring adequate growth and metabolic control. Thereafter, the baby developed a severe encephalopathy with drug resistant epileptic seizures. The progression of the neurological damage and a CVC-related sepsis led him to exitus at 2¬†years. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of early post-natal onset of GA-I reported in literature to date, in the absence of expanded newborn screening (NBS) programme. As expanded NBS programmes for inborn errors of metabolism have not yet been internationally adopted, we are of the opinion that such diseases may well be hidden by misleading signs and symptoms imputable to other more frequent harmful clinical conditions. Moreover, it would be advisable that neonatologists be trained to include GA-I in the differential diagnosis of neurological damage secondary to PA.","Biasucci, G. and Morelli, N. and Natacci, F. and Mastrangelo, M.",0,143

However, construct validity of these behaviors as cues among infants with differing medical histories has not been adequately addressed beyond the neonatal period. This study compared patterns of occurence in motor behaviors frequently interpreted as cues in full-term infants (n = 30) and three diagnostic groups of preterm infants (n = 62) at 3 months corrected age. A computerized real-time coding system was used for video analysis during standard infant-mother and temperament assessment protocols. Composites representing frequencies and durations of engagement, disengagement, facial expression, and midline behaviors were compared between groups using ANOVA with contrasts. Engagement and disengagement behaviors were represented equally among the groups. Behaviors associated with midline activity highlighted differences between infants with and without neurological involvement, whereas smiling differentiated healthy preterm infants or term infants from those with a history of illness or neurological involvement. ¬© 1996 Ablex Publishing Corporation, 355 Chestnut Street, Norwood, New Jersey 07648.","Bigsby, R. and Coster, W. and Lester, B.

Methods: Longitudinal study of 178 infants (73 VP/VLBW and 105 FT). Feeding problems and maternal sensitivity were assessed at term, 3 and 18 months. A cross-lagged path model was tested to assess the longitudinal associations. Results: The direction of the association between maternal sensitivity and feeding problems differed among VP/VLBW and FT infants. In VP/VLBW infants, higher feeding problems at term and 3 months were associated with less maternal sensitivity at 3 months (Œ≤ = -.27, p <.05) and at 18 months (Œ≤ = -.36, p <.05), respectively. In FT infants, a reciprocal relationship of feeding problems and maternal sensitivity over time was found. Feeding problems at 3 months were associated with decreased maternal sensitivity at 18 months (Œ≤ = -.32, p <.05), whereas decreased maternal sensitivity at 3 months was related to increased feeding problems at 18 months (Œ≤ = -.25, p <.05). Conclusion: Feeding problems are frequent in VP/VLBW infants and subsequently are associated with poorer maternal sensitivity. In FT infants, poorer levels of maternal sensitivity were both predicted by feeding problems but also were associated with more feeding problems over time. ¬© 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Nevertheless, there is paucity of empirical research investigating the association between leaving infant to cry it out and consequent crying duration and frequency, mother‚Äìinfant attachment and behavioural development. Methods The sample with complete longitudinal data comprised 178 infants and their caretakers. Parental use of ‚Äòleaving infant to cry out‚Äô and cry duration were assessed with maternal report at term, 3, 6 and 18 months, and frequency of crying was assessed at term, 3 and 18 months of age. Attachment was measured at 18 months using the strange situation procedure. Behavioural development of the infant was assessed with two observational measures and a parent‚Äêreport questionnaire at 18 months. Results The use of ‚Äòleaving infant to crying‚Äô was rare at term and increased over the next 18 months. ‚ÄòLeaving infants to cry it out‚Äô at term was associated with a decrease in crying frequency at 3 months. Furthermore, leaving infants to cry it out a few times at term and often at 3 months was associated with shorter fuss/cry duration at 18 months of age. No adverse impacts of leaving infants to cry it out in the first 6 months on infant‚Äìmother attachment and behavioural development at 18 months were found. Conclusions Contemporary practice of some parents in the United Kingdom to occasionally or often ‚Äòleaving infant to cry it out‚Äô during the first 6 months was not associated with adverse behavioural development and attachment at 18 months. Increased use of ‚Äòleaving to cry it out‚Äô with age may indicate differential responding by parents related to infant self‚Äêregulation.

185,Infant crying problems and symptoms of sleeping problems predict attachment disorganization at 18 months,"This longitudinal study examined the associations among infant crying, symptoms of sleeping problems, and attachment while considering the influence of maternal sensitivity and depressive symptoms. One hundred and five healthy full-term infants (42.9% female) were assessed for crying and symptoms of sleeping problems at 3 and 18 months via parental interview. Maternal sensitivity was measured through researcher observation, and attachment was measured at 18 months using the Strange Situation procedure. It was found that infant crying and symptoms of sleeping problems were not linked to the organized patterns of secure or insecure (avoidant versus resistant) attachment. However, when the disorganized attachment was considered, there were direct links found from infant crying and symptoms of sleeping problems at 3 months (Œ≤=.22, p<.05) and 18 months (Œ≤=.21, p<.05). Thus, crying and symptoms of sleeping problems as early as 3 months may indicate a disruption in the coherence of infants‚Äô relationship to their caretakers. ¬© 2019, ¬© 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bilgin, A. and Wolke, D.",1,150
187,Starting early: obesity prevention during infancy,"Obesity prevalence among infants and young children has increased rapidly during the past 4 decades, a disturbing trend given early obesity's association with later life obesity and its comorbidities. Fortunately, infancy is a period of great behavioral and metabolic plasticity offering numerous targets for preventive interventions. Modifiable factors that may affect early rapid weight gain and obesity risk include infant sleep duration, feeding to soothe infant distress, and the introduction of solid foods and transitional feeding. We discuss evidence linking these factors to weight outcomes, as well as results from behavioral obesity interventions in infancy, from our laboratory and others'. For example, in a recent pilot intervention, we focused on helping new mothers address three areas of infant behavior hypothesized to affect weight gain and early obesity risk: infant sleeping, crying, and feeding. First-time mothers were randomly assigned to receive either a Soothe/Sleep intervention, an Introduction of Solids intervention, both interventions, or no interventions. The interventions were delivered via home visits and showed positive effects on infant behaviors and weight outcomes at 1 year. Based on evidence from such pilot interventions, we assess the plausibility of targeting behavioral factors in infancy and suggest next steps for early prevention research.","Birch, L.

188,Early childhood obesity prevention policies,"Childhood obesity is a serious health problem that has adverse and long-lasting consequences for individuals, families, and communities. The magnitude of the problem has increased dramatically during the last three decades and, despite some indications of a plateau in this growth, the numbers remain stubbornly high. Efforts to prevent childhood obesity to date have focused largely on school-aged children, with relatively little attention to children under age 5. However, there is a growing awareness that efforts to prevent childhood obesity must begin before children ever enter the school system. Early Childhood Obesity Prevention Policies reviews factors related to overweight and obese children from birth to age 5, with a focus on nutrition, physical activity, and sedentary behavior, and recommends policies that can alter children's environments to promote the maintenance of healthy weight. Because the first years of life are important to health and well-being throughout the life span, preventing obesity in infants and young children can contribute to reversing the epidemic of obesity in children and adults. The book recommends that health care providers make parents aware of their child's excess weight early. It also suggests that parents and child care providers keep children active throughout the day, provide them with healthy diets, limit screen time, and ensure children get adequate sleep. In addition to providing comprehensive solutions to tackle the problem of obesity in infants and young children, Early Childhood Obesity Prevention Policies identifies potential actions that could be taken to implement those recommendations. The recommendations can inform the decisions of state and local child care regulators, child care providers, health care providers, directors of federal and local child care and nutrition programs, and government officials at all levels. ¬© 2011 by the National Academy of Sciences.

189,Promoting equity through integrated early child development and nutrition interventions,"Sustainable development, a foundation of the post-2015 global agenda, depends on healthy and productive citizens. The origins of adult health begin early in life, stemming from genetic-environmental interactions that include adequate nutrition and opportunities for responsive learning. Inequities associated with inadequate nutrition and early learning opportunities can undermine children's health and development, thereby compromising their productivity and societal contributions. Transactional theory serves as a useful framework for examining the associations that link early child development and nutrition because it emphasizes the interplay that occurs between children and the environment, mediated through caregiver interactions. Although single interventions targeting early child development or nutrition can be effective, there is limited evidence on the development, implementation, evaluation, and scaling up of integrated interventions.

191,Home and videotape intervention delays early complementary feeding among adolescent mothers,"BACKGROUND: The American Academy of Pediatrics, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and the World Health Organization recommend that infants receive only breast milk or formula for the first 4 to 6 months of life, followed by the introduction of complementary foods. Despite these recommendations, many infants, particularly those with adolescent mothers, receive solid foods (often cereal mixed with formula in a bottle) and liquids other than formula or breast milk in the first few weeks of life. Decisions on early feeding are often guided by grandmothers and influenced by beliefs that infants need complementary food to counteract signals of hunger, reduce crying, and sleep through the night. OBJECTIVE: This investigation evaluated the efficacy of an intervention to delay the early introduction of complementary feeding among first-time, black, adolescent mothers living in multigenerational households. The intervention focused on reducing the cultural barriers to the acceptance of the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics, WIC, and World Health Organization on complementary feeding by highlighting 3 topics: 1) recognition of infants' cues","Black, M.

192,The positive prognostic implications of crying during exam on threshold ROP,"INTRODUCTION: Most infants cry with lid speculum, scleral depression and indirect ophthalmoscopy. This simple observation, ""did the infant cry?"" during the initial 31-week ROP screening exam was prospectively studied. METHODS: From Fall 1989 through Summer 2003, all Alaskan infants with birthweight < or = 1500 grams were examined by RWA. After 1992, at the 31-week initial ROP screening, we recorded whether the infant was able to cry (cry), did not cry (quiet), or was intubated (vent) during indirect ophthalmoscopy with lid speculum and scleral depression. RESULTS: ROP was classified as to threshold in 873 infants. Infants who were able to cry during their 31-week GA screening exam were less likely to progress to threshold (Chi square 600, 2 = 36, p < .001). Using a logistic fit of Threshold, the increased risk of ROP in infants unable to cry persisted independent of gestational age or birthweight. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory and neurologic co-morbidity may render those infants unable to cry during the first screening examination at increased risk to progress to threshold ROP.","Blackledge, J. and Lang, D.

193,Variability in antibiotic regimens for surgical necrotizing enterocolitis highlights the need for new guidelines,"Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis or NEC is the most common gastrointestinal emergency in the newborn. The etiology of NEC remains unknown, and treatment consists of antibiotic therapy and supportive care with the addition of surgical intervention as necessary. Unlike most surgical diseases, clear guidelines for the type and duration of peri-operative antibiotic therapy have not been established. Our aim was to review the antibiotic regimen(s) applied to surgical patients with NEC within a single neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and to evaluate outcomes and help develop guidelines for antibiotic administration in this patient population. Patients and Methods: A single-center retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent surgical intervention for NEC from August 1, 2005 through August 1, 2015. Relevant data were extracted including gestational age, age at diagnosis, gender, pre-operative antibiotic treatment, post-operative antibiotic treatment, development of stricture, and mortality. Patients were excluded if there was incomplete data documentation. Results: A total of 90 patients were identified who met inclusion criteria. There were 56 male patients and 34 female patients. The average gestational age was 30 5/7 wks and average age of diagnosis 16.7 d. A total of 22 different pre-operative antibiotic regimens were identified with an average duration of 10.6 d. The most common pre-operative regimen was ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole for 14 d. A total of 15 different post-operative antibiotic regimens were identified with an average duration of 6.6 d. The most common post-operative regimen was ampicillin, gentamicin, and metronidazole for two days. There were 26 strictures and 15 deaths. No regimen or duration proved superior. Conclusion: We found that there is a high degree of variability in the antibiotic regimen for the treatment of NEC, even within a single NICU, with no regimen appearing superior over another. As data emerge that demonstrate the adverse effects of antibiotic overuse, our findings highlight the need for guidelines in the antibiotic treatment of NEC and suggest that an abbreviated course of post-operative antibiotics may be safe. ¬© Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","Blackwood, B.

194,Sensory processing disorders,"Recognition of the importance sensory processing plays in development has become more prevalent during the last decades. From birth, sensory processing influences an infant‚Äôs actions through reflexive motor actions and state regulation. Challenges in processing sensory information affect the infant‚Äôs development from early on and are often misunderstood by caregivers and professionals. This chapter focuses on existing research on sensory processing disorder in infants and young children, the impact these disorders have on later performance, the evaluation tools available at present, and the interventions that have used sensory experiences or have been used to address the problems. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

195,Milk-induced hypoalgesia in human newborns,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether milk and its components reduce crying in newborns during and after blood collection for phenylketonuria evaluation. METHODOLOGY: Seventy-two normal newborns ingested 2 mL of milk (Similac), Ross Special Formula, fat, protein, lactose, sucrose, or water for the 2 minutes preceding blood collection via heel lance. Crying duration during and for the 3 minutes after the procedure was determined by scorers who were blind to the ingestive substance. RESULTS: Sucrose and Similac each reduced crying during the blood collection procedure. Sucrose, fat, protein, and Ross Special Formula were effective during the 3-minute recovery period. Neither water nor lactose were effective during or after blood collection. CONCLUSION: Milk and some of its components are antinociceptive in human newborns. Based on previous studies, reduced crying during and after painful stimulation may be mediated through endogenous opioids. These findings are of potential clinical significance: natural protective mechanisms, normally engaged during suckling, may safely and noninvasively be activated to reduce newborn crying to painful stimulation.","Blass, E.

198,Health care interventions for excessive crying in infants: Regularity with and without swaddling,"This article describes two health care interventions developed to support parents whose infant cries excessively. Intervention 1 consists of advice to caregivers to bring about regularity and uniformity in daily infant care and to reduce external stimuli. Intervention 2 is the same advice accompanied by instructions to swaddle during sleep. Nurses can teach parents these interventions easily. The goal is to help infants to establish a stable sleep-wake rhythm, for overtiredness to disappear and excessive crying to stop. The approach is based on offering predictability, which helps to develop infant self-regulating ability. If the intervention succeeds, which is often the case, the baby cries less, drinks adequately, is able to fall asleep on their own and to sleep sufficiently, and therefore is no longer overtired. Parental stress is reduced, which could translate into an improvement in family health and quality of interaction between the parents and the child. ¬© 2009 SAGE Publications.","Blom, M.

199,A cluster randomized web-based intervention trial to reduce food neophobia and promote healthy diets among one-year-old children in kindergarten: Study protocol,"Background: A child's first years of life are crucial for cognitive development and future health. Studies show that a varied diet with a high intake of vegetables is positive for both weight and cognitive development. The present low intake of vegetables in children's diets is therefore a concern. Food neophobia can be a barrier for vegetable intake in children. Our hypothesis is that interventions that can increase children's intake of vegetables should be introduced early in life to overcome children's neophobia. This study aims to develop, measure and compare the effect of two different interventions among one-year-old children in kindergartens to reduce food neophobia and promote healthy diets. Methods: The kindergartens are randomized to one of three groups: two different intervention groups and one control group. We aimed to include a total of 210 children in the study. The first intervention group will be served a warm lunch meal with a variety of vegetables, 3 days a week during the intervention period of 3 months. The second intervention group will be served the same meals and, in addition, kindergarten staff will be asked to implement pedagogical tools including sensory lessons, adapted from the Sapere method, and advices on meal practice and feeding practices. The control group continues their usual meal practices. Parents and kindergarten staff will complete questionnaires regarding food neophobia, food habits and cognitive development at baseline and post intervention. A similar intervention among 2-year-old children in kindergarten has been implemented and evaluated earlier. We will investigate whether a digital version of this intervention has an effect, because digital interventions can be easily implemented nationwide. We will also investigate whether there are benefits of conducting such interventions in younger children, before the onset of food neophobia. Questionnaires, information videos and recipes will be digitally distributed. Discussion: Results of this study will provide new knowledge about whether a sensory education and a healthy meal intervention targeting children, kindergarten staff and parents will reduce levels of food neophobia in children, improve parental and kindergarten feeding practices, improve children's dietary variety, improve children's cognitive development and reduce childhood overweight. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","Blomkvist, E.

200,Supplementary feeding in the maternity ward shortens the duration of breast feeding,"In a prospective study, feeding routines of a maternity unit and the subsequent feeding patterns of 521 newborns were analysed. During the stay in the maternity unit, 69% of newborns were exclusively breast fed and 1% received only donor's milk from the milk bank and/or formula. Nine percent received their mothers' milk by bottle at least once and 21% received one or more supplementary feedings with donor's milk from the milk bank. One-quarter of the children received supplementary feeds on the third day of life, the indications for this being birth weight less than 3.0 kg, maternal diabetes or gestational diabetes, ""insufficient amounts"" of milk or fussiness. At three months, 65% were being exclusively breast fed and 15% partially breast fed. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the potential determinants (neonatal feeding, maternal characteristics, characteristics of the delivery and the child) for the duration of breast feeding were included. The adjusted relative risk (estimated as odds ratios, OR) of not being breast fed at three months was associated with maternal age (< 25 years, OR 4.2), maternal smoking (OR 4.0), neonatal feeding (supplements given, OR 3.9) and initial weight loss (10% or more, OR 2.8). Thus the administration of supplementary donor's milk or formula during the early neonatal period was associated with an increased risk of a short duration for breast feeding, even after adjustment for a number of potential confounders.","Blomquist, H.

203,Effects of antihypertensive drugs on ultrasound production and cardiovascular responses in 15-day-old rats,"When exposed to extreme cold or injected with the Œ±2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine, infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). Based upon the cardiovascular changes that accompany these two manipulations, especially decreased venous return, it was hypothesized that USVs are the acoustic by-product of the abdominal compression reaction (ACR), a maneuver that increases venous return. If this hypothesis is correct, then other anithypertensive drugs that decrease venous return should evoke USVs. In Experiment 1, sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 400 Œºg/kg), a direct-acting dilator of arteries and veins, was administered to 15-day-old rats under thermoneutral conditions while cardiac rate and ultrasound production were monitored. In Experiment 2, femoral artery pressure was monitored after SNP administration. Infants responded to SNP administration with decreased arterial pressure and tachycardia and, in addition, significantly increased ultrasound production. In Experiment 3, chlorisondamine (5 mg/kg), a ganglionic blocker that causes vasodilation and bradycardia, and hydralazine (20 mg/kg), a selective dilator of arteries, was administered to 15-day-olds. As predicted, chlorisondamine evoked ultrasound production and hydralazine did not. These results introduce SNP and chlorisondamine as only the second and third known agents capable of independently evoking USVs in thermoneutral conditions, and provide further support for the notion that ultrasound production is triggered by decreased venous return. ¬© 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

205,"In-Hospital Formula Supplementation of Healthy Newborns: Practices, Reasons, and Their Medical Justification","INTRODUCTION: In-hospital formula supplementation is a common practice and has been shown to be a strong determinant of shorter exclusive and any breastfeeding. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reasons for and circumstances in which in-hospital formula supplementation occurs and whether the stated reasons are medically acceptable. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted among 342 mother-infant pairs from April to July 2011 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital of Split, Croatia. Data were collected based on ""every feed"" charts and WHO/UNICEF ""Questionnaire for Monitoring Baby-Friendly Hospitals"". We used WHO/UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative and Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine documents on indications for supplemental feeding. RESULTS: During the first 48 hours and entire hospital stay, 49.5% and 62.8% of infants, respectively, received supplements, given on average 16.68‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ18.6 hours after delivery. In 94.1% of supplemented infants, healthy newborns were given artificial milk, of which 5.9% of mothers had not been notified. The most common maternal reasons for supplementing were ""lack of milk"" (49.8%), a ""crying baby"" (35.5%), ""cesarean section"" (11.5%), newborn weight loss (10.6%), and sore nipples (10.1%). Of all the given reasons, 24.6% were categorized as being medically acceptable. Primiparas were 1.3 times more likely to supplement in hospital, whereas multiparas were 1.3 times more likely to exclusively breastfeed. CONCLUSION: In our study, most reasons for formula supplementation of healthy term newborns were not standard acceptable medical reasons, indicating a need for improved maternal support, revision of hospital policies, and training of hospital staff.","Boban, M. and Zakarija-Grkoviƒá, I.",0,166

207,Umbilical blood flow patterns directly after birth before delayed cord clamping,"BACKGROUND: Delayed umbilical cord clamping (DCC) affects the cardiopulmonary transition and blood volume in neonates immediately after birth. However, little is known of blood flow in the umbilical vessels immediately after birth during DCC. The objective is to describe the duration and patterns of blood flow through the umbilical vessels during DCC. METHODS: Arterial and venous umbilical blood flow was measured during DCC using Doppler ultrasound in uncomplicated term vaginal deliveries. Immediately after birth, the probe was placed in the middle of the umbilical cord, pattern and duration of flow in vein and arteries were evaluated until cord clamping. RESULTS: Thirty infants were studied. Venous flow: In 10% no flow was present, in 57% flow stopped at 4:34 (3:03-7:31) (median (IQR) min:sec) after birth, before the cord was clamped. In 33%, flow continued until cord clamping at 5:13 (2:56-9:15) min:sec. Initially, venous flow was intermittent, increasing markedly during large breaths or stopping and reversing during crying, but then became continuous. Arterial flow: In 17% no flow was present, in 40% flow stopped at 4:22 (2:29-7:17) min:sec, while cord pulsations were still palpable. In 43% flow continued until the cord was clamped at 5:16 (3:32-10:10) min:sec. Arterial flow was pulsatile, unidirectional towards placenta or bidirectional to/from placenta. In 40% flow became continuous towards placenta later on. CONCLUSIONS: During delayed umbilical cord clamping, venous and arterial umbilical flow occurs for longer than previously described. Net placental transfusion is probably the result of several factors of which breathing could play a major role. Umbilical flow is unrelated to cessation of pulsations.","Boere, I. and Roest, A.

208,The Crying Clinic: Increasing accessibility to Infant Mental Health services for immigrant parents at risk for peripartum depression,"Peripartum depression (PPD) is considered a major public health concern due to its profound impact on families, including infants. In this paper, we report on a pilot initiative designed to reduce barriers and stigma related to the use of traditional infant mental health services for immigrant parents deemed at high risk of PPD. The Crying Clinic (CC) is an innovative walk-in service offered in a culturally diverse Canadian community to support maternal well-being and healthy parent‚Äìinfant relationships. The CC was designed to be a gateway to existing infant mental health services, through its emphasis on accessibility and cultural sensitivity. Support for concrete concerns, such as anxiety about normative infant behaviors like crying, is underscored in this approach to attract vulnerable families who would otherwise not access mental health support. A review of 44 users, utilization, plans for the use of additional services, and client evaluations suggests that the CC accomplished most of its goals. We conclude that gateway service models such as the CC have the potential to enhance traditional infant mental health programs by creatively addressing the challenge of engaging highly vulnerable parents from culturally diverse backgrounds. ¬© 2020 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health","Bohr, Y. and Bimm, M. and Bint Misbah, K. and Perrier, R. and Lee, Y. and Armour, L. and Sockett-DiMarco, N.",0,169
211,Adult perceptions of positive and negative infant emotional expressions,"Adults' perceptions provide information about the emotional meaning of infant facial expressions. This study asks whether similar facial movements influence adult perceptions of emotional intensity in both infant positive (smile) and negative (cry face) facial expressions. Ninety-five college students rated a series of naturally occurring and digitally edited images of infant facial expressions. Naturally occurring smiles and cry faces involving the co-occurrence of greater lip movement, mouth opening, and eye constriction, were rated as expressing stronger positive and negative emotion, respectively, than expressions without these 3 features. Ratings of digitally edited expressions indicated that eye constriction contributed to higher ratings of positive emotion in smiles (i.e., in Duchenne smiles) and greater eye constriction contributed to higher ratings of negative emotion in cry faces. Stronger mouth opening contributed to higher ratings of arousal in both smiles and cry faces. These findings indicate a set of similar facial movements are linked to perceptions of greater emotional intensity, whether the movements occur in positive or negative infant emotional expressions. This proposal is discussed with reference to discrete, componential, and dynamic systems theories of emotion. Copyright ¬© 2005, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.","Bolzani Dinehart, L.

212,Nature vs nurture in infant sleep: A longitudinal italian study in the first two months of life,"Background The endogenous characteristics of sleep and its regulation have been well described on the basis of biological mechanisms, but the human being shows ample individual differences in his sleep pattern starting from the early stages of life. The existing literature claims that environmental factors can account for these differences. Aim This study aims to confirm previous North American and North European findings about the normal developmental pattern of infant sleeping in a group of Italian babies in the first two months of life and to discuss the influence of biology and environment on infant sleep. Method A cohort of 70 healthy, full-term Italian infants was assessed longitudinally at 2, 5 and 8 weeks of age. Mothers were asked to fill in 24-hour behaviour diaries for three consecutive days at each age, providing data about the daily amount of infant sleeping.Result Findings from the diaries show that the Italian infants spend the same quantity of time sleeping taking into consideration the amounts reported in other studies on infant of the same ages, indicating that at least in the first two months, the sleeping pattern is similar across different countries. Discussion These results seem to suggest that environmental and cultural variations for instance in terms of effects of different parenting behaviors and expectations on infant sleeping, can be taken into stronger consideration with child's increasing age. Basing upon these data implications for theory on the developmental pattern of sleeping, as well as clinical practice, will be discussed. ¬© 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Bonichini, S.",1,171
213,Infant crying and maternal holding in the first 2 months of age: An Italian diary study,"This study aims to confirm previous North American and North European findings about the normal developmental pattern of infant crying by studying the crying of Italian babies. A cohort of 70 healthy, full-term Italian infants was assessed longitudinally at 2, 5 and 8 weeks of age. Mothers were asked to fill in 24-h behaviour diaries for 3 consecutive days at each age. Results show significant differences in the amount of daily crying between 2 and 8 weeks and between 5 and 8 weeks. Different from other similar studies, no significant cry peak at 5 weeks was found in the Italian babies, but the amount of time Italian mothers spent holding their babies showed a peak at 5 weeks. Infants cried more during the evenings and mothers carried them most during this part of the day. Significant correlations between maternal holding and infant crying were found both concurrently and predictively. The amount of infant crying at 2 weeks predicted the amount of holding at 5 weeks. Results confirmed previous findings about the individual stability of daily crying in the first 8 weeks of age, but future research should take account of cultural variations in maternal holding in studying infant crying in different societies.

The expanded version of the ‚ÄúBrief Infant Sleep Questionnaire‚Äù is a questionnaire developed by Sadeh for assessing sleep problems and their causes in early childhood. We have translated this questionnaire and assessed sleep problems and their causes among infants. Patients and Methods: The translation process was undertaken with the consent of the author. The final translated questionnaire was evaluated using a sample of 121 infants. Results: The parents of 11.6% of the infants considered their infants‚Äô sleep to be a very serious problem, 22.3% had a small problem, and 66.1% had no problem at all. According to the poor sleeper criteria suggested by Sadeh, 32.2% (39) infants were considered as poor sleepers. In a logistic regression analysis sleeping in the parent‚Äôs bed was associated with sleeping poorly. The mother‚Äôs perception of the infant‚Äôs sleep as a problem correlated with infant‚Äôs sleep problem criteria suggested by Sadeh. Conclusion: Test results provide preliminary evidence that the Turkish translation is acceptable and understandable for assessing sleep problems during early childhood. ¬© 2014, Marmara University.

215,Maternal Sensitivity and Children's Behavior Problems: Examining the Moderating Role of Infant Sleep Duration,"The current study aimed to examine infant sleep duration as a moderator of the relations between maternal sensitivity and child externalizing and internalizing symptoms, in a prospective longitudinal design. Fifty-five Caucasian infants (33 girls) took part in 2 assessments, at 1 and 4 years. Maternal sensitivity was rated at 1 year, based on observations performed throughout a home visit. Infant sleep duration (i.e., nighttime sleep duration and 24-hr sleep duration) was assessed at 1 year as well, using a sleep diary completed by mothers. At 4 years, mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist to assess children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results indicated that maternal sensitivity interacted with infant nighttime sleep duration, such that there were negative relations between sensitivity and subsequent internalizing and externalizing symptoms only for children who slept more at night. Interactions using 24-hr sleep duration as the moderator were not significant. These findings add to an emerging literature on the importance of sleep for children's daytime functioning by suggesting that inadequate or insufficient sleep in infancy can interfere with the normal developmental process linking early maternal sensitivity to child subsequent emotional and behavioral adjustment. ¬© 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Bordeleau, S. and Bernier, A. and Carrier, J.",0,174

Three dimensions of maternal interactive behavior were considered using 70 mother-child dyads, while the quality of father-child interactions was assessed using 41 of these families. Maternal mind-mindedness was assessed at 12 months during a mother-infant free-play sequence, maternal sensitivity was rated at 12 months based on observations performed throughout a home visit, maternal autonomy support was assessed at 15 months with a 10-min problem-solving situation, and the quality of father-child interactions was scored at 18 months, during father-child free play. Children's sleep was assessed at 3 and 4 years using a sleep diary completed by mothers during 3 consecutive days. Results indicated that, after controlling for family socioeconomic status and daycare attendance, the quality of both mother-infant and father-infant interactions was positively related to children's percentage of night-time sleep at preschool age. These findings add to previous literature in suggesting that early caregiving behavior by both mothers and fathers is related to subsequent child sleep. ¬© 2012 American Psychological Association.","Bordeleau, S. and Bernier, A. and Carrier, J.",0,175

Furthermore, the study aimed to explore the distinct sociodemographic as well as mother and infant related factors that are associated with the above parenting aspects. Design: A descriptive and cross-sectional study design was used. Setting: Three separate postpartum wards 1-7 days after childbirth in one university level hospital in Finland. Participants: All mothers who gave birth during March 1st to May 20th, 2019 and filled the inclusion criteria, were invited to participate in this study. A convenience sample of 250 mothers with healthy singleton infants agreed to participate. Measurements and findings: The following instruments were used: The Parenting Self-Efficacy (PSE) scale, the Evaluation subscale of What Being the Parent of a New Baby is Like-revised (WBPL-R) and the Perception of Infant scale. Mothers‚Äô parenting self-efficacy and parenting satisfaction were high during the first days postpartum. Age, marital status, education and type of birth were not associated with parenting self-efficacy nor satisfaction. Mothers who were unemployed or working only part-time reported higher scores across all categories of parenting self-efficacy, compared to full time employed mothers (p < .001). A higher number of children (‚â• 3) were positively associated with both parenting self-efficacy and satisfaction. Mothers who reported poor breastfeeding initiation success also reported significantly lower scores in parenting self-efficacy and parenting satisfaction across all categories. Mothers‚Äô perceptions of their infants‚Äô fussiness were not associated with parenting self-efficacy (p = .113) nor parenting satisfaction (p = .091). Key conclusions and implications for practice: The results of this study can benefit postpartum maternity health care professionals by suggesting factors that could be focused on during the very short period that mothers stay in hospital. Discussing prior mothering experiences, work life before maternity leave, breastfeeding initiation experiences and perception of infant with the mothers after childbirth, may lead to better PSE and PS during the postpartum period. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Botha, E. and Helminen, M. and Kaunonen, M. and Lubbe, W. and Joronen, K.",0,178
222,Defining awakening from anesthesia in neonates: a consensus study,"BACKGROUND: A descriptive tool for determining awakening in infants is desirable to test the value of depth of anesthesia monitors. Although scales and criteria have been developed for children and infants, none has been applied to the study of anesthetised neonates. We aimed to seek consensus in a group of experts on a definition of awakening at the end of anesthesia in neonates. METHODS: We used a modified Delphi technique with an iterative process of questionnaires and anonymised feedback. Communication was conducted by email. Thirty-one consultant pediatric anesthetists in the UK and Ireland took part. Consensus was defined a priori as 80% agreement. RESULTS: The 83% of respondents agreed that defining awakening is possible. Consensus was reached on six criteria and also that a combination of these criteria must be used. As crying and attempting to cry are similar, we propose that at least two of the following five behaviors are present to consider a neonate awake after anesthesia: (i) crying or attempting to cry, (ii) vigorous limb movements, (iii) gagging on a tracheal tube, (iv) eyes open, and (v) looking around. There was also consensus that three stimuli are appropriate to test rousability in neonates awakening from anesthesia: (i) removal of skin adhesive tape, (ii) stroking/tickling the skin or gentle shaking, and (iii) pharyngeal suction. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a scale for determining awakening from anesthesia in neonates that may be used in future studies, particularly regarding electroencephalographic data and depth of anesthesia monitoring in neonates.","Bould, M.

225,"Can broad-spectrum multinutrients treat symptoms of antenatal depression and anxiety and improve infant development? Study protocol of a double blind, randomized, controlled trial (the 'NUTRIMUM' trial)","Background: Untreated antenatal depression and anxiety can be associated with short and long term health impacts on the pregnant woman, her infant and the rest of the family. Alternative interventions to those currently available are needed. This clinical trial aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of a broad-spectrum multinutrient formula as a treatment for symptoms of depression and anxiety in pregnant women and to determine the impact supplementation has on the general health and development of the infant. Methods: This randomised, controlled trial will be conducted in Canterbury, New Zealand between April 2017 and June 2022. One hundred and twenty women aged over 16 years, between 12 and 24 weeks gestation and who score ‚â• 13 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) will be randomly assigned to take the intervention (n = 60) or an active control formula containing iodine and riboflavin (n = 60) for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, participants can enter an open-label phase until the birth of their infant and naturalistically followed for the first 12 months postpartum. Infants will be followed until 12 months of age. Randomisation will be computer-generated, with allocation concealment by opaque sequentially numbered envelopes. Participants and the research team including data analysts will be blinded to group assignment. The EPDS and the Clinical Global Impressions Scale of Improvement (CGI-I) will be the maternal primary outcome measures of this study and will assess the incidence of depression and anxiety and the improvement of symptomatology respectively. Generalized linear mixed effects regression models will analyse statistical differences between the multinutrient and active control group on an intent-to-treat basis. A minimum of a three-point difference in EPDS scores between the groups will identify clinical significance. Pregnancy outcomes, adverse events and side effects will also be monitored and reported. Discussion: Should the multinutrient formula be shown to be beneficial for both the mother and the infant, then an alternative treatment option that may also improve the biopsychosocial development of their infants can be provided for pregnant women experiencing symptoms of depression and anxiety.

Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted with children enrolled at birth in Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil, whose mothers underwent prenatal care at primary care units. Soon after the birth of the children, data were collected on anthropometrics, type of childbirth, and time until breastfeeding on the first day of life. At 6 and 12 months of age, data were collected on breastfeeding practices and whether the child had used a pacifier in the previous 6 months. Statistical analysis involved the use of Poisson regression with robust variance. Results: The incidence of pacifier use in the first year of life was 60% (317/532). The multivariable analysis showed that pacifier use in the first year of life was 33% higher when the mother was younger than 18 years of age (relative risk [RR] = 1.33","Braga, V. S. and V√≠tolo, M.

227,The neonate cry after cesarean section and vaginal delivery during the first minutes of life,"Although the option for vaginal delivery is most physiological, the achievement of cesarean section is very common in Brazil. The neonate cry represents the beginning of both processes, physiological adaptation and human vocal communication. The cry emission depends on the functioning of respiratory and laryngeal muscles, which are controlled by the nervous system. The acoustic analysis of neonate cry is useful in the assessment of healthy babies and can be used to characterize the signals of diseases through a previously multidisciplinary diagnosis, with immediate medical intervention. The present study compared the acoustic cry characteristics of 30 healthy newborn after a cesarean section and 30 healthy newborn after a vaginal delivery, of both genders, from the exact moment of birth until the first 5 min of life. Using the softwares VOXMETRIA and GRAM, it was possible to analyze the duration, frequency, intensity, occurrence, localization and inspiratory phonation, besides the type of spectrographic tracings. The acoustic cry characteristics of newborns after a C section and a vaginal delivery could evidence not only harmonic, expiratory, acute and strong emissions, but also emissions rich in sounds and varied in types of melody. The differences found can be related to the physiology of birth.","Branco, A. and Behlau, M. and Rehder, M. I.",0,183
230,Timing for the Introduction of Cycled Light for Extremely Preterm Infants: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"Day-night cycled light improves health outcomes in preterm infants, yet the best time to institute cycled light is unclear. The hypothesis of this study was that extremely preterm infants receiving early cycled light would have better health and developmental outcomes than infants receiving late cycled light. Infants born at ‚â§28 weeks gestation were randomly assigned to early cycled light (ECL) starting at 28 weeks postmenstrual age [PMA] or late cycled light (LCL), starting at 36 weeks PMA. Daylight was 200‚Äì600 lux and night was 5‚Äì30 lux. Primary outcomes were weight over time and length of hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs, sleep development, and neurodevelopment at 9, 18, and 24 months corrected age. Of 121 infants randomized, 118 were included in analysis. Weight gain in the two groups did not differ significantly but increased across time in both groups. In PMA weeks 36‚Äì44, the mean weight gain was 193.8 grams in the ECL group compared to 176.3 grams in the LCL group. Effect sizes for weight were Cohen d = 0.26 and 0.36 for 36 and 44 weeks PMA. Infants in the ECL group went home an average of 5.5 days earlier than the LCL group, but this difference was not statistically significant. There were no group differences on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Although statistically non-significant, clinically important differences of improved weight gain and decreased hospital stay were observed with ECL. The small observed effect sizes on weight during hospitalization should be considered in future cycled light research with extremely preterm infants. ¬© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ¬© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Brandon, D.

Behaviors indicative of reactivity included objective ratings of average intensity cry, peak intensity cry, and latency to cry. Durations of orienting, avoidant, and nonnegative communicative behaviors were assessed as measures of regulation at each age. Results show that infant behavior during frustrating situations show both continuity and change from 5‚Äì10 mo. Observed behaviors were organized into similar constructs reflecting reactivity and regulation at both 5 and 10 mo, indicating continuity in the structure of factors.

Studied affiliative responses to a strange adult in 48 White middle-class 1-yr-olds using home visits and an adaptation of M. D. S. Ainsworth and B. A. Wittig's 1969 ""Strange Situation."" In the laboratory playroom mother and child were joined by a female stranger who attemped to engage the infant in play. After the 8-min play episode the mother briefly left and returned. Infant facial expression, toy manipulation, vocalization, and body orientation were videotaped while 2 researchers taperecorded narrative accounts. Frequency, duration, and incidence measures were taken. Infants' responses to the stranger were overridingly favorable. Mild wary responses combined with affiliative behaviors. 94% of the infants played one or more games with the stranger, and only 23% protested separation from the mother by crying. During home visits interaction with the stranger was even more prolonged. The affiliative behaviors exhibited are an initial stage in the process of attachment. They are best classified as interaction-motivated attachment behaviors that should be distinguished from the security-motivated attachment behaviors that are almost invariably directed toward the mother.

A major factor involved in this effect is consumption of unprocessed cow's milk obtained directly from a farm. However, this phenomenon has never been shown in a longitudinal design, and the responsible milk components are still unknown. Objectives We sought to assess the asthma-protective effect of unprocessed cow's milk consumption in a birth cohort and to determine whether the differences in the fatty acid (FA) composition of unprocessed farm milk and industrially processed milk contributed to this effect. Methods The Protection Against Allergy - Study in Rural Environments (PASTURE) study followed 1133 children living in rural areas in 5 European countries from birth to age 6 years. In 934 children milk consumption was assessed by using yearly questionnaires, and samples of the ""usually"" consumed milk and serum samples of the children were collected at age 4 years. Doctor-diagnosed asthma was parent reported at age 6 years. In a nested case-control study of 35 asthmatic and 49 nonasthmatic children, 42 FAs were quantified in milk samples.

238,Assessment of Neonatal Pain During Heel Prick: Lancet vs Needle-A Randomized Controlled Study,"BACKGROUND: Heel prick is a frequent painful procedure in newborns. A lancet or a 26-gauge needle is used for a heel prick in India. OBJECTIVE: To compare the pain caused by heel prick with a lancet or a 26-gauge needle in newborns admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) using the preterm infant pain profile (PIPP). METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted over 2 months in a Level III NICU with a sample size of 40 subjects (20 in each group), which was required for the study to have a power of 80% with an alpha error of 0.05. Hemodynamically stable newborns on at least those on partial oral feeds undergoing heel prick for routine glucose monitoring were randomized into two groups within 48‚Äâh of NICU admission after informed parental consent: heel prick with a lancet or with a 26-gauge needle using computer-generated random numbers. Two milliliters of expressed breast milk was given 2‚Äâmin before the heel prick. Pain before, during and after (1 and 5‚Äâmin) was assessed using the PIPP score. The primary outcome measure was the PIPP score. The secondary outcome measures were the duration of audible cry and the number of pricks needed for an adequate sample. Statistical analysis was done using the Mann Whitney U test and Friedman's test on SPSS v.21. A p value of‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05 was significant. RESULTS: There were 40 neonates, 24 males and 16 females included in the study with a median age of 7 days. The mean birth weight was 2441‚Äâg (SD: 699) at a mean gestation of 34.4 weeks (SD: 3.2).

239,Infant temperament and maternal anxiety and depressed mood in the early postpartum period,"Although difficult infant temperament has been associated with maternal postpartum anxiety and depressed mood in later infancy, the emergence of this association in the early postpartum period has not been explored. In a survey study of 296 mothers of healthy term newborns during the first postpartum month, the relationship of infant temperament with maternal anxiety and depressed mood was explored. Maternal ratings of infant temperament were measured by the Early Infancy Temperament Questionnaire. Postpartum anxiety was measured by the State Scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and depressed mood by the Beck Depression Inventory. The State Scale and Beck Depression Inventory correlated positively with ratings of infant activity, rhythmicity, approach, distractibility, and overall temperamental difficulty. In addition, the State Scale correlated positively with ratings of adaptability and intensity. In regression analyses, controlling for other factors, ratings of overall temperamental difficulty were independently associated with both State Scale and Beck Depression Inventory scores. Associations of difficult infant temperament withmaternal postpartum anxiety and depressive symptoms emerge early in the postpartum period. These associations are independent of other known contributors to postpartum mood. ¬© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Britton, J. R.",1,191
240,Introducing solids and water to Australian infants,"Background: Recommendations for the introduction of solids and fluids to an infants diet have changed over the past decade. Since these changes, there has been minimal research to determine patterns in the introduction of foods and fluids to infants. Methods: This retrospective cohort study surveyed mothers who birthed in Queensland, Australia, from February 1 to May 31, 2010, around 4 months postpartum. Frequencies of foods and fluids given to infants at 4, 8, 13, and 17 weeks were described. Logistic regression determined associations between infant feeding practices, the introduction of other foods and fluids at 17 weeks, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Response rate was 35.8%. At 17 weeks, 68% of infants were breastfed and 33% exclusively breastfed. Solids and water had been introduced in 8.6% and 35.0% of infants, respectively. The introduction of solids by 17 weeks was associated with younger maternal age and the infant being given water and infant formula at 4 weeks. The infant being given water at 17 weeks was associated with younger maternal age, the infant being given infant formula at 4 weeks, level of education, relative socioeconomic disadvantage, parity, and birth facility. Conclusion: Over the past decade, there has been a significant reduction in the proportion of infants in Australia who have been given solids by 17 weeks. Sociodemographic characteristics and formula feeding practices at 4 weeks were associated with the introduction of solids and water by 17 weeks. Further research should examine these barriers to improve compliance with current infant feeding recommendations. ¬© 2013 The Author(s).","Brodribb, W. and Miller, Y.",0,192
241,Toddlers with Early Behavioral Problems at Higher Family Demographic Risk Benefit the Most from Maternal Emotion Talk,"Objective: To test the hypothesis that toddlers at highest risk for behavioral problems from the most economically vulnerable families will benefit most from maternal talk about emotions. Methods: This study included 89 toddlers and mothers from low-income families. Behavioral problems were rated at 2 time points by masters-level trained Early Head Start home visiting specialists. Maternal emotion talk was coded from a wordless book-sharing task. Coding focused on mothers' emotion bridging, which included labeling emotions, explaining the context of emotions, noting the behavioral cues of emotions, and linking emotions to toddlers' own experiences. Maternal demographic risk reflected a composite score of 5 risk factors. Results: A significant 3-way interaction between Time 1 toddler behavior problems, maternal emotion talk, and maternal demographic risk (p .001) and examination of slope difference tests revealed that when maternal demographic risk was greater, more maternal emotion talk buffered associations between earlier and later behavior problems. Greater demographic risk and lower maternal emotion talk intensified Time 1 behavior problems as a predictor of Time 2 behavior problems. The model explained 54% of the variance in toddlers' Time 2 behavior problems. Analyses controlled for maternal warmth to better examine the unique contributions of emotion bridging to toddlers' behaviors. Conclusion: Toddlers at highest risk, those with more early behavioral problems from higher demographic-risk families, benefit the most from mothers' emotion talk. Informing parents about the use of emotion talk may be a cost-effective, simple strategy to support at-risk toddlers' social-emotional development and reduce behavioral problems. ¬© 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","Brophy-Herb, H.

242,"Differences in eating behaviour, well-being and personality between mothers following baby-led vs. traditional weaning styles","Baby-led weaning, where infants self-feed family foods in place of traditional spoon-feeding of purees, is continuing to grow in popularity. Evidence is emerging which suggests that the method may promote healthier eating behaviour and weight gain in children, but the research is in its infancy. One issue is the self-selecting nature of participants to the approach. Although those who follow a baby-led approach are known to have a higher education and more professional occupation, little is known about wider maternal characteristics, which might affect either adoption of or outcomes of the method. The aim of this study was to explore differences in maternal characteristics between those adopting a baby-led or traditional approach. Six hundred four mothers with an infant aged 6‚Äì12 months completed a questionnaire including a copy of the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) (anxiety, obsessive‚Äìcompulsive and depression scales) and Ten Item Personality Questionnaire (TIPQ) alongside details of weaning approach (baby-led vs. traditional). Mothers who adopted a baby-led weaning style scored significantly lower on restrained eating (DEBQ), anxiety and introversion (TIPQ) and anxiety and obsessive‚Äìcompulsive symptoms (BSI). Mothers who currently adopt a baby-led approach are therefore significantly different in personality, eating behaviour and well-being characteristics compared with those adopting a traditional approach. These characteristics may affect likelihood of choosing a baby-led approach or indirectly affect outcomes for infants weaned using the approach. Further research exploring baby-led weaning in a wider population sample is needed. ¬© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Brown, A.",0,194
243,Early influences on child satiety-responsiveness: The role of weaning style,"Background: Nutrition during infancy may have a long-term impact upon weight gain and eating style.How infants are introduced to solid foods may be important.Traditionally, infants are introduced to solid foods via spoon-feeding of purees.However, baby-led weaning advocates allowing infants to self-feed foods in their whole form.Advocates suggest this may promote healthy eating styles, but evidence is sparse.The aim of the current study was to compare child eating behaviour at 18-24 months between infants weaned using a traditional weaning approach and those weaned using a baby-led weaning style.Methods: Two hundred ninety-eight mothers with an infant aged 18-24 months completed a longitudinal, self-report questionnaire.In Phase One, mothers with an infant aged 6-12 months reported breastfeeding duration, timing of solid foods, weaning style (baby-led or standard) and maternal control, measured using the Child Feeding Questionnaire.At 18-24 months, post-partum mothers completed a follow-up questionnaire examining child eating style (satiety-responsiveness, food-responsiveness, fussiness, enjoyment of food) and reported child weight.Results: Infants weaned using a baby-led approach were significantly more satiety-responsive and less likely to be overweight compared with those weaned using a standard approach.This was independent of breastfeeding duration, timing of introduction to complementary foods and maternal control.Conclusions: A baby-led weaning approach may encourage greater satiety-responsiveness and healthy weight-gain trajectories in infants.However, the limitations of a self-report correlational study are noted.Further research using randomized controlled trial is needed. ¬© 2013 The Authors.Pediatric Obesity published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Association for the Study of Obesity.","Brown, A. and Lee, M.

244,Body image concerns during pregnancy are associated with a shorter breast feeding duration,"Objective: breast feeding is affected by numerous psycho-social factors. Antenatal concerns such as embarrassment regarding public feeding and the impact of breast feeding upon breast shape are known to lead to artificial milk use. However, although work has explored the relationship between maternal weight and infant feeding, wider body image concerns have not been examined. The aim of the current study was to explore the association between maternal body image concerns during pregnancy upon intended and actual breast feeding duration. Design: a two stage self report questionnaire completed during pregnancy and at six months post partum. Setting: mothers were recruited from local mother and infant groups, nurseries and online mother and infant forums. Participants: 128 pregnant women completed both stages. Measures: phase one: completion of a questionnaire exploring body image during pregnancy (concerns about stretch marks, weight gain and appearance) and planned breast feeding duration during the second/third trimester of pregnancy (body image, weight, intended duration) followed by a second questionnaire measuring actual breast feeding duration and breast feeding experiences. Findings: factor analysis revealed three primary body image concerns: pregnancy body image, prospective postnatal body image and dieting during pregnancy. Higher concerns on all three factors were associated with both intended and actual shorter breast feeding duration. Amongst mothers who stopped breast feeding before six months, those with higher body image concerns were more likely to report stopping due to embarrassment or the perceived impact upon their breast shape. The relationship was not explained by maternal weight, although a higher residual weight gain at six months was associated with a shorter breast feeding duration. Conclusions and implications for practice: mothers who are affected negatively by changes to their body during pregnancy may be less likely to plan to or initiate breast feeding potentially due to underlying issues such as embarrassment or perceived impact of feeding upon their appearance. The findings are important to those working with women during pregnancy and the postpartum period in understanding the impact of body image upon intention and ability to initiate and continue breast feeding. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Brown, A. and Rance, J. and Warren, L.",0,196
245,Development of a bundle measure for preventive service delivery to infants in primary care,"Rationale, aims and objectives In the United States, paediatric patients receive only 41% of indicated preventive services. Past improvement efforts have not bundled preventive services to measure the reliability with which infants' physical, developmental and emotional needs are all addressed. We aimed to create a comprehensive bundle measure that reflects reliable delivery of preventive services during primary care visits, as well as overall preventive service status of a population of patients served by three primary care centres. Method Data were collected from electronic health records for cohorts of infants < 14 months old with at least one visit to one of three primary care centres. Immunizations, lead screening, developmental screening and screening for biopsychosocial risk factors (gestational age, parental depression, food insecurity) were chosen by local expert consensus for inclusion in the preventive services bundle measure. Monthly measures of preventive service status at 14 months of age were constructed. A visit-level bundle measure of preventive service delivery was also created. To obtain a baseline for improvement work, bundle completion rates were calculated for infants born in May 2011. Visit-level performance was measured for visits from July to August 2012. Results Among 278 patients born in May 2011, 22% of patients received the entire bundle of preventive services by 14 months of age. On a visit level, patients received all indicated services at 58% of visits. Conclusion A novel bundle measure can be used to characterize delivery of preventive services and drive improvement at both an individual visit level and a population level. ¬© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Brown, C.

Methods: Seven hundred four parent/child pairs participated in a longitudinal cohort study. Structured interview recording general demographic data, feeding habits, intercurrent diseases, family history, sleep habits, and parental evaluation of the infant's sleep carried out at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months Results: Nocturnal, daytime, and total sleep duration showed a high inter-individual variability in the first year of life associated with changes in the first 6 months and stability from 6 to 12 months. Bedtime was at around 22:00 and remained stable at 6, 9, and 12 months of age. Approximately 20% of the infants had more than 2 awakenings and slept more often in the parent bed. Nearly 10% of the infants were considered as having a problematic sleep by parents and this significantly correlated with nocturnal awakenings and difficulties falling asleep. Conclusions: Sleep patterns change during the first year of life but most sleep variables (i.e., sleep latency and duration) show little variation from 6 to 12 months.

250,The impact of infant crying on young women: A randomized controlled study,"Infant crying is a common source of distress in parents. This study used an experimental paradigm to explore the impact of infant crying on mood, perceptions of temperament and caregiving behaviours in young women. The use of a life-like programmable baby doll with a real infant's cry sound recorded within it enabled rigorous control of the amount and intensity of crying exposure. Dependent variables included state anxiety, negative affect change after exposure and doll handling behaviour during exposure. Participants were 80 female undergraduate students (mean age519.62 years, SD52.02, all non-mothers). Results showed that exposure to infant crying had an immediate impact on young women's negative affect, state anxiety and was related to more negative perceptions of infant temperament. The study predictions regarding negative caretaking responses to crying could not be tested, but participant comments about feelings of self-efficacy in caretaking are discussed. The substantial shortterm impact that infant crying had on women's mood and affect confirms the need for health professionals working with new parents to be sensitive to the impact of persistent infant crying, both with regard to mood state and confidence in caretaking. ¬© 2009 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.","Bruning, S. and McMahon, C.",0,202
251,Exclusive breastfeeding changes in Brazil attributable to pacifier use,"Background Identifying key interventions to increase exclusive breastfeeding duration has been a challenge. Pacifier use has been associated with exclusive breastfeeding discontinuation in Brazil. However, the proportion of the improvement in exclusive breastfeeding duration attributable to pacifier use remains unknown. Research aim Quantify the proportion of increases in exclusive breastfeeding prevalence that can be attributed to reduced pacifier use over time. Methods Secondary data analyses of two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys conducted in States‚Äô capitals in 1999 and in 2008 (N = 42,395 Brazilian infants under 6 months of age). We estimated the fraction of exclusive breastfeeding prevalence improvements that could be attributed to pacifier use based on multilevel regression analysis. Results From 1999 to 2008, there was an increase of 15.2 percentage points in exclusive breastfeeding prevalence and a decrease of approximately 17 percentage points in the prevalence of pacifier use among infants under 6 months. Reduction in pacifier use explained an increase in 5.5 percentage points‚Äô exclusive breastfeeding rates. If pacifier use were to decrease from 41.6% (prevalence in 2008) to 14% (as found in New Zealand), there would be an expected additional increase in exclusive breastfeeding of approximately 12 percentage points. Conclusions About one-third of the improvements in EBF prevalence observed in Brazil over a decade can be attributed to the corresponding decline in pacifier use. Copyright: ¬© 2018 Buccini et al.

253,Pacifier Use and Exclusive Breastfeeding in Brazil,"Background: Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates for infants younger than 6 months have increased in Brazil, although at the current pace of improvement it would take 6 years to reach an EBF rate of 50%. Thus, it is important to identify relevant modifiable key risk factors for the premature interruption of EBF. Objective: This study aimed to find out if pacifier use is an independent risk factor for the interruption of EBF among Brazilian infants. Methods: We conducted secondary cross-sectional data analyses of 2 waves of infant feeding surveys conducted in 1999 and in 2008 in the Brazilian state capitals and Federal District (N = 42 395 children < 6 months). Multivariate logistic regression was used to test the association between pacifier use and the risk of interruption of EBF in a pooled sample and within each survey wave, adjusting for socioeconomic, demographic, and biomedical confounders. Results: In the pooled sample, a third of the infants were exclusively breastfed (32.7%) and almost 50% had used a pacifier. Whereas EBF prevalence among infants increased from 25.1% in 1999 to 40.3% in 2008, pacifier use prevalence decreased from 58.5% to 41.6% in the same time period. Pacifier use was strongly associated with the risk of interruption of EBF in 1999 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.65","Buccini, G. D. S. and P√©rez-Escamilla, R. and Venancio, S. I.",0,204
254,Determinants of using pacifier and bottle feeding,"Objective: To analyze the factors associated with the use of pacifiers and/ or bottle feeding in infants aged under one year. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study with 34,366 children and using data from the database of the 2nd Nationwide Survey of Breastfeeding Prevalence performed in the Brazilian capitals and Federal District in 2008. Cluster sampling was used. The questionnaire included questions about the use of artificial nipples in the last 24 hours. The analysis considered three outcomes: exclusive use of pacifier, exclusive use of bottle feeding, and use of artificial nipples (pacifier and bottle feeding). Prevalence ratios were obtained using Poisson regression with robust variance following a hierarchical model. Results: The following factors were associated with exclusive use of the pacifier: mother working outside the home, primiparity, child was not breastfed within the first hour, and child had consumed tea on the first day at home. The following factors were associated with exclusive use of bottle feeding: mother working outside the home, primiparity, low birth weight, child not breastfed within the first hour, and child had consumed milk formula and tea on the first day at home. The following factors were associated with use of artificial nipples (pacifier and bottle feeding): mother working outside the home, primiparity, cesarean delivery, the male gender, low birth weight, born in a hospital not accredited as ""baby friendly"", required health baby monitoring in the Primary Health Care Unit (PR = 0.91), and child had consumed milk formula, water, or tea on the first day at home. Conclusions: This study identified profiles of exclusive users of pacifiers, bottle feeding, and both. The provided information can guide preventive practices for child health.","Buccini, G.

258,Breast milk and glucose for pain relief in preterm infants: a noninferiority randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: The study goal was to compare the efficacy of expressed breast milk (EBM) versus 25% glucose on pain responses of late preterm infants during heel lancing. METHODS: In a noninferiority randomized controlled trial, a total of 113 newborns were randomized to receive EBM (experimental group [EG]) or 25% glucose (control group [CG]) before undergoing heel lancing. The primary outcome was pain intensity (Premature Infant Pain Profile [PIPP]) and a 10% noninferiority margin was established. Secondary outcomes were incidence of cry and percentage of time spent crying and adverse events. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used. RESULTS: Groups were similar regarding demographics and clinical characteristics, except for birth weight and weight at data collection day. There were lower pain scores in the CG over 3 minutes after lancing (P < .001). A higher number of infants in the CG had PIPP scores indicative of minimal pain or absence of pain (P = .002 and P = .003 on ITT analysis) at 30 seconds after lancing, and the mean difference in PIPP scores was 3 (95% confidence interval: 1.507-4.483). Lower incidence of cry (P = .001) and shorter duration of crying (P = .014) were observed for CG. Adverse events were benign and self-limited, and there was no significant difference between groups (P = .736 and P = .637 on ITT analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Results based on PIPP scores and crying time indicate poorer effects of EBM compared with 25% glucose during heel lancing. Additional studies exploring the vol and administration of EBM and its combination with other strategies such as skin-to-skin contact and sucking are necessary.","Bueno, M. and Stevens, B. and de Camargo, P.

The cohort included 4438 newborns brought to a clinic for the first time between 1 April and 1 July 1998. The odds ratios of demographic and gestational variables connected with the start and duration of breastfeeding were measured. The frequency of the reasons why breastfeeding was interrupted was determined. At birth 71% of the infants included in this study were exclusively breastfed. After 4 mo the percentage had dropped to 21%. Breast milk was replaced directly by formula (23%) or by a mixture of breast milk and formula (77%). Exclusive breastfeeding was given irrespective of the mother's cultural background.

At that time parents rated infant temperament and responded to a structured pediatric interview. Developmental testing was performed by a psychologist, who also rated infant behavior. Some significant associations found between these separate ratings indicate the usefulness of the temperament scale for infant behavior studies and suggest the need for a combined approach to behavioral evaluation. The total score of minor anomalies also showed low but significant association with irritable, fussy behavior as rated at the pediatric interview and by parent questionnaire. The usefulness of temperament and anomaly measures for prediction of later behavior problems is currently being assessed by longitudinal follow-up.

263,Infant feeding beliefs and practices: Effects of maternal personal characteristics,"Purpose: Information is limited about how mothers make food decisions on behalf of their children. Eating practices are established early in life and are difficult to change, so it is imperative to focus on the caregiver who influences a young child's food preferences and eating behaviors. The purpose of this secondary data analysis was to examine the relationship between maternal characteristics and infant feeding beliefs and practices in a sample of multiparous mothers with a history of a prior preterm infant birth. Design and Methods: Secondary analysis of a subset of data (n = 112) collected from women who participated in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) assessing the efficacy of a home-based intervention to improve maternal and child outcomes. Inclusion criteria for the RCT: women ‚â•18 years of age at enrollment with a prior preterm live birth >20 and <37 weeks gestation, <24 weeks gestation at enrollment, spoke/read English, and received prenatal care at a regional medical center. Criteria for the subset included: completed the Infant Feeding Questionnaire at 5 months postpartum and had reported a prenatal body mass index (BMI). Univariate correlations and multiple linear regression analyses were used to assess the associations between maternal personal characteristics and infant feeding practices. Results: Median age of the mothers was 27 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 23‚Äì32) with median education of 12 years (IQR: 12‚Äì16).

266,"Prevalence, patterns, and persistence of sleep problems in the first 3 years of life","OBJECTIVE: Examine the prevalence, patterns, and persistence of parent-reported sleep problems during the first 3 years of life. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-nine mother/child pairs participated in a prospective birth cohort study. Sleep questionnaires were administered to mothers when children were 6, 12, 24, and 36 months old. Sleep variables included parent response to a nonspecific query about the presence/absence of a sleep problem and 8 specific sleep outcome domains: sleep onset latency, sleep maintenance, 24-hour sleep duration, daytime sleep/naps, sleep location, restlessness/vocalization, nightmares/night terrors, and snoring. RESULTS: Prevalence of a parent-reported sleep problem was 10% at all assessment intervals. Night wakings and shorter sleep duration were associated with a parent-reported sleep problem during infancy and early toddlerhood (6-24 months), whereas nightmares and restless sleep emerged as associations with report of a sleep problem in later developmental periods (24-36 months). Prolonged sleep latency was associated with parent report of a sleep problem throughout the study period. In contrast, napping, sleep location, and snoring were not associated with parent-reported sleep problems. Twenty-one percent of children with sleep problems in infancy (compared with 6% of those without) had sleep problems in the third year of life. CONCLUSIONS: Ten percent of children are reported to have a sleep problem at any given point during early childhood, and these problems persist in a significant minority of children throughout early development. Parent response to a single-item nonspecific sleep query may overlook relevant sleep behaviors and symptoms associated with clinical morbidity.

267,Perceived fussy eating in Australian children at 14¬†months of age and subsequent use of maternal feeding practices at 2¬†years,"BACKGROUND: Concerns about fussy eating are common amongst parents of young children. However, studies of the long-term impact of fussy eating show mixed results with regard to adequacy of dietary intake and child growth. This may be in part because there is no accepted definition of fussy eating and studies measure the construct in different ways, commonly relying on parent perception. This longitudinal analysis explores maternal and child characteristics associated with maternal perception of her toddler as a fussy eater in early toddlerhood and subsequent use of feeding practices at 2¬†years. METHODS: Mothers completed a self-administered questionnaire at child age 14¬†months, describing perception of their child as fussy/not fussy and child behaviour. Intake was assessed using a single 24-h recall and weight was measured by research staff. At child age 2¬†years mothers completed the validated 28-item Feeding Practices and Structure Questionnaire (FPSQ-28). Weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) was derived from WHO standards. Gram daily intake of fruit, vegetables and meat/alternative and a dietary diversity score were determined. Maternal/child characteristics independently associated (p¬†‚â§¬†0.05) with perception of child as a fussy eater were determined using logistic regression. Variables were combined in a structural equation model assessing the longitudinal relationship between child/maternal characteristics, perception of child as a fussy eater and eight FPSQ factors. RESULTS: Mothers' (n¬†=¬†330) perception of her child as a fussy eater at age 14¬†months, was associated with higher frequency of food refusal and lower WAZ (R (2)¬†=¬†0.41) but not dietary intake. Maternal perception as fussy (age 14¬†months) was associated with four FPSQ factors at 2¬†years (n¬†=¬†279) - Reward for Eating, Reward for Behaviour, Persuasive Feeding and Overt Restriction, x (2) /df¬†=¬†1.42, TLI¬†=¬†0.95, CFI¬†=¬†0.95, RMSEA¬†=¬†0.04(0.03-0.05), PCLOSE¬†=¬†0.99. CONCLUSIONS: Lower relative child weight and food refusal prompted mothers to perceive their child as fussy. These behaviours in healthy weight children most likely reflect self-regulation of energy intake and neophobia. This perception was prospectively associated with use of non-responsive feeding practices, which may increase obesity risk. Future interventions could directly address perceptions of growth and fussiness, supporting parents to understand food refusal as developmentally appropriate behaviour in healthy young children.

To address these gaps, in this chapter we first present a brief demographic profile of Latinx in the United States to contextualize the later theoretical and empirical discussions. We then review theoretical frameworks that explain SES differences in Latinx home environments and examine how they have been used to explain disparities in Latinx children's outcomes. Third, we describe the current research on the early home environments of Latinx children of varying levels of parental SES. Fourth, we review the literature on Latinx children's inequalities noting the scarcity of research that compares Latinx to White children or Latinx to Black children compared to the studies that focus on the White-Black academic gap. Finally, we conclude by summarizing state of knowledge and offering suggestions for future directions. We focus on young children (0‚Äì8) due to space limitations but also because the early childhood period is foundational to later development and is where the effects of poverty most likely to have enduring effects. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cabrera, N.

The purpose was to describe various phonatory behaviors in infants in whom significant hearing loss could be ruled out. We also compared these results with normal-hearing full-term infants, and evaluated whether linkage exists among acoustic cry features and various anthropometric, diagnostic and treatment variables obtained throughout the peri- and neonatal periods. Our analysis revealed that cry duration was significantly related to total days receiving respiratory assistance. The occurrence of other complex spectral and temporal aspects of acoustic cry vocalizations including harmonic doubling and vibrato also increased in infants receiving some form of respiratory assistance. The presence of harmonic doubling also depended on weight and conceptional age at test. The discussion focuses on the implication of these relationships and directions for future research.","Cacace, A. T. and Robb, M. P. and Saxman, J. H. and Risemberg, H. and Koltai, P.",0,219
272,Effects of swaddled and traditional tub bathing methods on crying and physiological responses of newborns,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two bathing methods on crying duration and physiological measurements of newborns. DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized trial design was used in this study. The sample consisted of newborns (n = 80) who were admitted to neonatal intensive care unit of a university hospital located in a large city. The groups were determined as swaddled bathing (SB) (n = 40) and traditional tub bathing (TTB) (n = 40) by using random number table. All newborns were bathed 24 hours after the birth. Environmental variables were organised identically in both experimental and control groups. Duration of bathing was determined as maximum 5 min in both groups. Body temperature, heart rate (HR), and O(2) saturation values were evaluated before bath, just after the bath and at 10 min after the bath. The groups were compared in terms of all vital symptoms and duration of crying during bath. Pre-bath and post-bath stress levels between newborns in both groups were compared by using the Newborn Infant Pain Scale (NIPS). RESULTS: When the newborns were compared based on groups, it was observed that there was no statistically significant difference between SB and TTB groups in terms of the gestational week, APGAR score, postnatal age, and body weight. Body temperatures of the newborns in SB group just after the bath and 10 minutes after the bath were significantly higher than those in TTB group. HR was higher in TTB group in the post-bath period. NIPS scores of the newborns in SB group after bath decreased at a statistically significant level, but the scores of the newborns in TTB group increased. The results of the study indicated that SB was effective in maintaining body temperature, SpO(2) level, and HR of newborns within normal limits and may decrease stress experienced during the bath. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Swaddled bathing decreases behavioural stress symptoms such as crying, agitation, and pulling arms and legs back unintentionally and thus the infants feel relaxed. Swaddled bathing can be recommended because swaddled bathing method decreases behavioural stress symptoms in infants.","√áaka, S. Y. and G√∂zen, D.",0,220

275,Assessment of infant sleep: How well do multiple methods compare?,"The current study compares sleep variables obtained from videosomnography, actigraphy, and sleep diaries, three of the most common sleep assessment methods used in infant sleep studies. Using a sample of 90 African American 3-month olds, we compare correlations and discrepancies for seven sleep variables across each of the three pairs of assessment methods for one night of a week-long sleep study. These seven variables are indicative of sleep schedule (e.g. sleep onset time, rise time), duration (e.g. sleep period, sleep time, wake time), and fragmentation (e.g. night wakings, longest sleep period). We find that across all sleep assessment methods, correlations are highest for variables indicative of sleep schedule, and lowest for variables indicative of sleep fragmentation. Comparing the magnitude and significance of the discrepancies, we find that actigraphy and sleep diaries significantly overestimate sleep period duration and underestimate the number of night waking episodes, compared with videosomnography. Actigraphy and sleep diaries were more concordant with one another than with videosomnography. Epoch-by-epoch analyses indicated that actigraphy had low sensitivity to detect wakefulness, compared with videosomnography. Contrary to our hypothesis, the discrepancies between sleep assessment methods did not vary widely based on infant sleep location (own room vs. parent's room) or sleep surface (own bed vs. parent's bed). Limitations and implications of these findings for future research are discussed. ¬© Sleep Research Society 2018. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Sleep Research Society.

280,How to achieve long-term breast-feeding: Factors associated with early discontinuation,"Objectives: To evaluate the factors associated with discontinuation of breast-feeding before 12 months in order to make suggestions for achieving long-term breast-feeding. Design: A descriptive cross-sectional study. Setting: Gazi University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey. Subjects: Mothers of 1230 children who discontinued breast-feeding at least 15 d before the last visit were asked to fill out a questionnaire about the discontinuation process. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the independent effects of factors that might influence breast-feeding discontinuation. Results: Mean breast-feeding duration of the study group was 11.04 (sd 7.45) months. Introduction of bottle-feeding correlated with discontinuation of breast-feeding (r = 0.507, P = 0.001). Important risk factors for discontinuation of breast-feeding before the first 12 months were not exclusively breast-feeding at 3 and 6 months, prematurity, not having a plan about breast-feeding duration and maternity leave duration of ‚â§91 d for working mothers. The common reasons for abandoning breast-feeding in the first and second 6 months were similar, namely the mother's concerns about the sufficiency of breast milk. After 12 months and 18 months the reasons for discontinuation were the baby's unwillingness to eat solid foods while breast-feeding and the mother's perception that 'the baby is old enough', respectively. Conclusion: The factors that improve long-term breast-feeding are successful exclusive breast-feeding in the first few months, intention of the mother to breast-feed and sufficient duration of maternity leave. This study emphasizes the importance of successful breast-feeding counselling during the first few months to achieve the desired long-term breast-feeding. ¬© The Authors 2008.","Camurdan, A.

Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody blocking TNF-Œ±, has proven effective as an induction and maintenance therapy for refractory Crohn's disease in adult and pediatric patients. However, infliximab therapy induces the appearance of neutralizing anti-infliximab antibodies. In the pediatric cohort, we analyzed (n = 28) sensitization occurred in 35.7% patients and was associated with a loss of response to maintenance infusions. In two patients presenting high titers of anti-infliximab antibodies, severe infusion reactions were observed, possibly IgE-mediated, precluding further use of the medication. Serum concentrations of TNF-Œ± and infliximab were influenced by the presence of anti-infliximab antibodies. We propose that surveillance of circulating infliximab and/or TNF-Œ± concentration during maintenance therapy represents an indirect but reliable method to monitor anti-infliximab immunization. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Follow-up at four years of age: still more ""emotional""","This paper presents a follow-up at 4 y of formerly colicky infants and controls, with respect to behaviour, temperament, eating and sleeping habits, psychosomatic complaints, number of hospital stays, growth and ""family climate"". There were no differences between the two groups in most parameters studied. However, ex-colicky children displayed more negative emotions according to the temperament scale. There were also more negative moods during meals, and more reported stomach-ache.

However, 7-day diaries of colicky and control infants (n = 116 + 119) revealed low distress amounts in colicky infants in general. In the subgroup of Wessel-colicky infants (n = 37), distress episodes were frequent and long lasting, and there was a high proportion of colicky crying versus fussing and normal crying. Even if there may be a reduction in the infantile colic incidence and support for the hypothesis that infantile colic is at least partially ""in the eye of the beholder,"" that is, the concerned parent, a subgroup of infants may be more ""genuinely colicky."" Women who had stated in late-pregnancy interviews that there is a risk of spoiling an infant with too much physical contact were more likely to have infants with colic, and their infants were more distressed, even when given the same amount of physical contact. This finding warrants further elucidation.","Canivet, C. and Jakobsson, I. and Hagander, B.",1,229

We investigated the effects of maternal uridine (as uridine-5‚Ä≤-monophosphate) and docosahexaenoic acid supplementation on pups' brain phospholipids, synaptic proteins and dendritic spine densities. Dams consumed neither, 1 or both compounds for 10 days before parturition and 20 days while nursing. By day 21, brains of weanlings receiving both exhibited significant increases in membrane phosphatides, various pre- and postsynaptic proteins (synapsin-1, mGluR1, PSD-95), and in hippocampal dendritic spine densities. Administering these phosphatide precursors to lactating mothers or infants could be useful for treating developmental disorders characterized by deficient synapses. Copyright ¬© 2009 S.

288,Eating behaviour patterns in Chinese children aged 12-18 months and association with relative weight--factorial validation of the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire,"BACKGROUND: Eating behaviours have been suggested relating to obesity development. The Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) is a parent-report measure constructed to assess multiple dimensions of eating behavior for children. This study aimed to test the validity of the Chinese version of Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) in Chinese children aged 12-18 months. We examined factor structure and the reliability of the Chinese version of the CEBQ, the associations between children's eating behaviours and children's weight (BMI SDS) were assessed. METHODS: 219 questionnaires were filled out by the caregivers, approached in community health care centers in two cities in China. BMI of each child was calculated and converted to BMI SDS. Factor validation (Principal Component Analysis, exploratory factor analysis) on all CEBQ items was performed and gender difference in eating behaviours was examined. Correlations between eating behaviours and the child's BMI SDS were analyzed by linear regression analysis controlling for gender, parental combined weight, and education. RESULTS: The factor analysis revealed a seven-factor solution, with factor 'food responsiveness' (FR) split into two. 'Satiety responsiveness' (SR) and 'Enjoyment of food' (EF) factors were not detected. Interestingly, boys scored higher than girls in the FR scales, whereas girls had a higher score in 'food fussiness' (FF) scale. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that although a valuable psychometric instrument, CEBQ might be affected by age and cultural differences. Therefore, adjusting it in order to fit the Chinese population was suggested. We did not find an association between eating behaviours and children's BMI SDS, when it was controlled for gender and parental weight.","Cao, Y.

289,"Preterm birth, pacifier use and breastfeeding: Is there a relationship?","The immaturity of born to preterm infants may predispose to sucking difficulties. This research aimed to evaluate if pacifier use is associated with preterm birth and influenced in type of infant feeding. This comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in Belo Horizonte, Brazil and evaluated 250 children aged 3 to 5 years. As a sample, two groups were established: the normal term children group (n=125) was selected at a day-care centre and the group of preterm children (125) was identified at a public university hospital with a preterm care project from birth to seven years of age. To collect data, a pre-tested questionnaire regarding information on gestational age, infant development, infant feeding and non-nutritive sucking habits was used for both groups. Bivariate and multivariate Poisson regression was used for the statistical analysis. Pacifier use was more prevalent in the preterm group (PR=1.20, 95% CI=1.02-1.42) who used the bottle (PR=1.38, 95% CI=1.15-1.64) and were breastfed for less than six months (PR=1.19, 95% CI=1.01-1.41). The majority of breastfed infants were of normal term birth (PR=1.14, 95% CI=1.04-1.20) and had monthly family income greater than USD 450.28 (RP= 1.10, 95% CI=1.01-1.20). In this study, pacifier use was more prevalent among preterm infants and associated with less than six months of breastfeeding and used of bottle. Monthly family income was associated with a prevalence of breastfeeding. ¬© 2018, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica. All rights reserved.","Carcavalli, L. and Martins, C.

292,Temperament and increased weight gain in infants,"Obtained weight and temperament data from a random sample of 200 normal infants from a largely middle-class private practice during the Ss' bimonthly visits at ages 6‚Äì12 mo. 24 Ss gained 30 or more percentile points in weight for length determinations between 6 and 12 mo of age, and 25 lost 20 percentile points or more. These growth data were compared with contemporaneous findings on the Infant Temperament Questionnaire developed by the author. Those gaining the most had significantly more difficult temperament ratings and were perceived by their mothers as more difficult than average. Ss with the most decelerated growth were not temperamentally different from the general sample. Negative mood rather than low activity was the specific characteristic distinguishing the Ss gaining the most. It is suggested that fussy infants are fed more to quiet them.

293,Infantile colic: A pediatric practitioner‚Äêresearcher's point of view,Infantile colic is at the same time exasperating and also fascinating and gratifying. This is the point of view of a pediatric practitioner and researcher with over three decades of practical experience. Colic is exasperating because of the unpleasantness of the extensive crying and because of the inadequacies of much of the existing research and writing on the subject. It is fascinating for the researcher and observing clinician because it probably represents the earliest known example of a behavior problem resulting from a stressful parent‚Äêchild interaction. It is gratifying because of the opportunity for successful clinical intervention to help distressed families. This paper summarizes the evidence supporting these points and suggests ways to solve some of the remaining problems. No new data are introduced,"Carey, W. B.",0,236
295,Autism spectrum disorders before diagnosis: results from routine developmental surveillance at 18 months,"AIM: This study investigated the results from the national, routine 18-month developmental surveillance at Child Healthcare Centres (CHCs) on children later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS: Child Healthcare Centre records of 175 children, diagnosed with ASD before 4.5 years in Stockholm County, Sweden, were reviewed regarding the results of the eight-item neurodevelopmental surveillance. Results were contrasted with normative data from the general child population in Stockholm County. RESULTS: More than one-third of the total ASD group, including half of the group with ASD and intellectual disability (ID), did not pass the required number of items, compared to one in 50 in the general child population. Of those with ASD and ID who had passed, more than one-third experienced developmental regression after 18 months of age. If the CHC surveillance had considered reported regulatory problems - crying, feeding and sleeping - then another 10% of the children with ASD and ID could have been identified during this surveillance. CONCLUSION: The existing CHC surveillance traced half of the group of children who were later diagnosed with ASD combined with intellectual disability. Adding an item on regulatory problems to the 18-month surveillance would have increased this number by another 10%.","Carlsson, L. H. and Westerlund, J. and Olsson, M. B. and Eriksson, M.

296,PVC flooring is related to human uptake of phthalates in infants,"Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flooring material contains phthalates, and it has been shown that such materials are important sources for phthalates in indoor dust. Phthalates are suspected endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Consecutive infants between 2 and 6months old and their mothers were invited. A questionnaire about indoor environmental factors and family lifestyle was used. Urinary metabolites of the phthalates diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP), and dietylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) were measured in the urine of the children. Of 209 invited children, 110 (52%) participated. Urine samples were obtained from 83 of these. Urine levels of the BBzP metabolite monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) was significantly higher in infants with PVC flooring in their bedrooms (P<0.007) and related to the body area of the infant. Levels of the DEHP metabolites MEHHP (P<0.01) and MEOHP (P<0.04) were higher in the 2-month-old infants who were not exclusively breast-fed when compared with breast-fed children. The findings indicate that the use of soft PVC as flooring material may increase the human uptake of phthalates in infants. Urinary levels of phthalate metabolites during early life are associated with the use of PVC flooring in the bedroom, body area, and the use of infant formula. Practical Implications: This study shows that the uptake of phthalates is not only related to oral uptake from, for example, food but also to environmental factors such as building materials. This new information should be considered when designing indoor environment, especially for children. ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Carlstedt, F. and J√∂nsson, B. A. G. and Bornehag, C. G.",0,238
298,Novel Methods for Screening: Contributions from Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up,"Preventative interventions are needed across the lifespan, including for children who have experienced maltreatment. However, interventions‚Äô effect sizes are typically smaller in real-world settings than in clinical trials. Identifying providers who are likely to implement interventions with fidelity could promote implementation outcomes through targeted allocation of training resources. This study tested two pre-training screening measures as predictors of provider fidelity to Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC), a preventative intervention for maltreated infants. One measure assessed valuing of attachment/openness, and the other used vignettes to assess initial skill in a key intervention component. In a sample of 42 providers across 197 sessions, both screening measures predicted future ABC fidelity, even when controlling for experience and education. These results support the development of screening measures for other interventions, suggesting approaches that target specific qualities and behaviors are likely to predict implementation fidelity. ¬© 2018, Society for Prevention Research.","Caron, E. and Roben, C.

300,Recovery from stunting and cognitive outcomes in young children: Evidence from the South African Birth to Twenty Cohort Study,"In this study we analyse the implications for cognitive function of recovery from stunting in early childhood. More specifically, we test whether children who met the definition for stunted at age 2, but not at age 5, perform better in cognitive tests than children who remain stunted over this period. The sample is drawn from the Birth to Twenty Cohort Study, a prospective data set of children born in 1990 in urban South Africa. The measure of cognitive function that we use is based on the Revised Denver Prescreening Developmental Questionnaire implemented when the children were age 5. We employ multivariate regression in the analysis to control for child-specific characteristics, socio-economic status, the home environment and caregiver inputs. We find that recovery from stunting is not uncommon among young children in our sample. However, children who recover from stunting by age 5 still perform significantly worse on cognitive tests than children who do not experience early malnutrition, and almost as poorly as children who remain stunted. These findings suggest that the timing of nutritional inputs in the early years is key in a child's cognitive development, with implications for school readiness and achievement. ¬© 2015 Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.","Casale, D. and Desmond, C.",0,241

METHODS: A prospective observational noncomparative cohort study, as part of postmarketing and customer satisfaction surveillance was specifically performed among family paediatricians in Lombardy, Italy. Two hundred and forty patients were admitted from 22 different family pediatricians belonging to the Italian Federation of Paediatricians (Federa-zione Italiana Medici Pediatri, FIMP) in Lombardy. All patients took part in the safety assessment. Two hundred and twelve patients (104 females, 108 males, average age 9.6 months, age range 1.8-27.6 months) also underwent clinical efficacy assessment (28 patients were excluded). Upon admission and at the first outpatient examination (E1), parents were taught by their family pediatrician to clean their babies' noses by nasal aspiration 3 times a day for 7 consecutive days immediately before feeding. At the end of treatment, a second outpatient examination (E2) was carried out at which parents' treatment diaries were collected and the parents answered a satisfaction questionnaire. SAFETY of use was checked using: 1) Italian Health Ministry incident/near incident report forms and 2) treatment diaries where the parents noted any events that had occurred while using the device every day. EFFICACY was assessed by analysing various clinical parameters (anterior and posterior rhinorrhea, oral respiration, noisy nasal respiration, and nasally transmitted chest sounds) measured by the pediatrician at the two examinations (E1 and E2), and the entries in the parents' treatment diary regarding quality of sleep, feeding and respiration, and use of any drugs.

305,The influence of maternal infant feeding practices and beliefs on the expression of food neophobia in toddlers,"Food neophobia is a highly heritable trait characterized by the rejection of foods that are novel or unknown and potentially limits dietary variety, with lower intake and preference particularly for fruits and vegetables. Understanding non-genetic (environmental) factors that may influence the expression of food neophobia is essential to improving children's consumption of fruits and vegetables and encouraging the adoption of healthier diets. The aim of this study was to examine whether maternal infant feeding beliefs (at 4 months) were associated with the expression of food neophobia in toddlers and whether controlling feeding practices mediated this relationship. Participants were 244 first-time mothers (M =30.4, SD= 5.1 years) allocated to the control group of the NOURISH randomized controlled trial. The relationships between infant feeding beliefs (Infant Feeding Questionnaire) at 4 months and controlling child feeding practices (Child Feeding Questionnaire) and food neophobia (Child Food Neophobia Scale) at 24 months were tested using correlational and multiple linear regression models (adjusted for significant covariates). Higher maternal Concern about infant under-eating and becoming underweight at 4 months was associated with higher child food neophobia at 2 years. Similarly, lower Awareness of infant hunger and satiety cues was associated with higher child food neophobia. Both associations were significantly mediated by mothers' use of Pressure to eat. Intervening early to promote positive feeding practices to mothers may help reduce the use of controlling practices as children develop. Further research that can further elucidate the bi-directional nature of the mother-child feeding relationship is still required. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cassells, E. L. and Magarey, A.

307,Appropriate age range for introduction of complementary feeding into an infant's diet,"Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel¬†on Nutrition, Novel Foods and Food Allergens (NDA) revised its 2009 Opinion on the appropriate age for introduction of complementary feeding of infants. This age has been evaluated considering the effects on health outcomes, nutritional aspects and infant development, and depends on the individual's characteristics and development. As long as foods have an age-appropriate texture, are nutritionally appropriate and prepared following good hygiene practices, there is no convincing evidence that at any age investigated in the included studies (<¬†1 to <¬†6¬†months), the introduction of complementary foods (CFs) is associated with adverse health effects or benefits (except for infants at risk of iron depletion). For nutritional reasons, the majority of infants need CFs from around 6¬†months of age. Infants at risk of iron depletion (exclusively breastfed infants born to mothers with low iron status, or with early umbilical cord clamping (<¬†1¬†min after birth), or born preterm, or born small-for-gestational age or with high growth velocity) may benefit from earlier introduction of CFs that are a source of iron. The earliest developmental skills relevant for consuming pureed CFs can be observed between 3 and 4¬†months of age. Skills for consuming finger foods can be observed in some infants at 4¬†months, but more commonly at 5‚Äì7¬†months. The fact that an infant may be ready from a neurodevelopmental perspective to progress to a more diversified diet before 6¬†months of age does not imply that there is a need to introduce CFs. There is no reason to postpone the introduction of potentially allergenic foods (egg, cereals, fish and peanut) to a later age than that of other CFs as far as the risk of developing atopic diseases is concerned. Regarding the risk of coeliac disease, gluten can be introduced with other CFs. ¬© 2019 European Food Safety Authority.

The influence of the maternal explanatory variables on the neonatal response variables were verified through bivariate analysis, ANOVA, and multiple regression. The mothers' behavior and depression and/or anxiety did not affect the neonates' responses to pain and stress, though the mothers' levels of salivary cortisol before the procedure explained the variance in the neonates' levels of salivary cortisol after the procedure (p=0.036). Additionally, the mothers' baseline levels of salivary cortisol along with the neonates' age explained the variance in the neonates' heart rate (p=0.001). The ability of mothers to regulate their own stress contributed to the infants' responses to pain and stress.","Castral, T. C. and Warnock, F. F. and Ribeiro, L. M. and de Vasconcelos, M.

317,Service Characteristics and Family Involvement in an Early Childhood System of Care,"Participation in community-based family interventions characterized by an integrated service approach is linked to enhanced caregiver and child outcomes. However, more research is needed that examines the developmental impacts of interventions serving young children and their families, given that adversity in early childhood may predict problematic developmental trajectories. We examined potential relations among perceived characteristics of an early childhood system of care serving children with severe emotional and behavioral challenges and their families, dimensions of family involvement, and changes in child and caregiver functioning from intake to 6 months. We analyzed data from 158 caregivers of children under age 6 (Mage = 3.9 years, SD = 1.11, Range = 1.4‚Äì5.9 years) who were primarily White and boys. Results indicated, for instance, that perceived cultural competence and general satisfaction were positively associated with active caregiver participation in services. Although multiple path models tested via path analyses were not statistically significant, the model that assessed the potential mediating effect of active caregiver participation on the relation between cultural competence and caregiver stress approached significance (z = ‚àí1.89, SE =.03, p =.06). Qualitative results indicated that caregivers primarily viewed receiving family support as the most helpful aspect of the SOC, followed by learning enhanced parenting skills and observing positive changes in their children‚Äôs behaviors. Our findings highlight important facets of an early childhood SOC linked to positive participant experiences and outcomes. We discuss limitations of our study and implications for future research. ¬© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Champine, R. B. and Whitson, M. L. and Kaufman, J. S.",0,254
318,Mothers' experiences of caring for premature children without major physical impairment in Taiwan,"Aim: To describe mothers' experiences of caring for premature children who are born without major physical impairment. Methods: This descriptive phenomenological study used purposive sampling, and conducted in-depth interviews with 13 mothers who were recruited from a regional hospital in Taiwan. The participants described their experiences of caring for their children who were born prematurely and without major physical impairment. Semi-structured question guides were used to guide the interviews and the participants' responses were tape-recorded and transcribed. Data were analysed using Giorgi's method. Results: Four major themes emerged from the analysis, including the immediate psychological impact experienced by the mothers, psychosocial adaptation of the mothers, developing positive family functions, and concerns for the future of the premature newborns and their mothers. Exploration of these findings indicate that nursing care should focus on the alleviation of the mothers' feelings of guilt, clear explanations of the infants' condition and positive prognoses, provision of individual teaching on infant care, and encouragement of fathers' participation in the caring of children. These nursing care interventions should be provided to the parents for the duration of the children's hospital admission. Conclusion: Through the results of this study, healthcare providers can better understand the mothers' experiences and provide parents with special assistance and interventions. ¬© 2007 Scientific Communications International Limited.","Chang, C.

320,Decreased activity and oxygen desaturation in prone ventilated preterm infants during the first postnatal week,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of supine and prone positions on oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), desaturation episodes (SpO(2) < 90% and >or= 20 seconds), and motor activity in ventilated preterm infants during their first postnatal week. DESIGN: With use of a crossover design, we randomly assigned infants to a supine/prone or prone/supine position sequence. Infants were placed in each position for 2 hours. A stabilization period of 10 minutes before observation of each position was allowed. During the protocol, care procedures were kept minimal and ventilator settings remained unchanged. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care units at 2 tertiary care centers in Taiwan. SAMPLE: The sample consisted of 28 infants receiving mechanical ventilation who were 25 to 36 weeks' gestation, without known congenital abnormalities, within 7 postnatal days of birth, and were not receiving sedation. RESULTS: When prone, infants had higher SpO(2), fewer episodes of oxygen desaturation, and less motor activity than when supine. No significant differences in duration of SpO(2) less than 90%, 85%, and 80% were found between the 2 positions. Seventy-four percent of desaturation episodes were associated with vigorous motor activity and crying. CONCLUSION: The prone position results in less motor activity and may stabilize oxygenation for ventilated preterm infants. This may conserve energy and decrease complications of hypoxia for sick preterm infants.","Chang, Y. J. and Anderson, G. C. and Dowling, D. and Lin, C. H.",0,257
321,Systematic review of the relationships between sleep duration and health indicators in the early years (0-4 years),"Background: The objective of this systematic review was to examine for the first time the associations between sleep duration and a broad range of health indicators in children aged 0 to 4 years. Methods: Electronic databases were searched with no limits on date or study design. Included studies (published in English or French) were peer-reviewed and met the a priori determined population (apparently healthy children aged 1 month to 4.99 years), intervention/exposure/comparator (various sleep durations), and outcome criteria (adiposity, emotional regulation, cognitive development, motor development, growth, cardiometabolic health, sedentary behaviour, physical activity, quality of life/well-being, and risks/injuries). The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Due to high levels of heterogeneity across studies, narrative syntheses were employed. Results: A total of 69 articles/studies (62 unique samples) met inclusion criteria. Data across studies included 148,524 unique participants from 23 countries. The study designs were randomized trials (n = 3), non-randomized interventions (n = 1), longitudinal studies (n = 16), cross-sectional studies (n = 42), or longitudinal studies that also reported cross-sectional analyses (n = 7). Sleep duration was assessed by parental report in 70% of studies (n = 48) and was measured objectively (or both objectively and subjectively) in 30% of studies (n = 21). Overall, shorter sleep duration was associated with higher adiposity (20/31 studies), poorer emotional regulation (13/25 studies), impaired growth (2/2 studies), more screen time (5/5 studies), and higher risk of injuries (2/3 studies). The evidence related to cognitive development, motor development, physical activity, and quality of life/well-being was less clear, with no indicator showing consistent associations. No studies examined the association between sleep duration and cardiometabolic biomarkers in children aged 0 to 4 years. The quality of evidence ranged from ""very low"" to ""high"" across study designs and health indicators. Conclusions: Despite important limitations in the available evidence, longer sleep duration was generally associated with better body composition, emotional regulation, and growth in children aged 0 to 4 years. Shorter sleep duration was also associated with longer screen time use and more injuries. Better-quality studies with stronger research designs that can provide information on dose-response relationships are needed to inform contemporary sleep duration recommendations. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).","Chaput, J.

We argue that poverty is an important indicator of societal and child well-being, but that poverty is more than just an indicator. Poverty and low income are causally related to worse child development outcomes, particularly cognitive developmental and educational outcomes. Mechanisms through which poverty affects these outcomes include material hardship, family stress, parental and cognitive inputs, and the developmental context to which children are exposed. The timing, duration, and community context of poverty also appear to matter for children's outcomes - with early experiences of poverty, longer durations of poverty, and higher concentrations of poverty in the community leading to worse child outcomes. ¬© 2016 Academic Pediatric Association.","Chaudry, A. and Wimer, C.",0,260
324,"Phosphatidylcholine supplementation in pregnant women consuming moderate-choline diets does not enhance infant cognitive function: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","Background: Choline is essential for fetal brain development, and it is not known whether a typical American diet contains enough choline to ensure optimal brain development. Objective: The study was undertaken to determine whether supplementing pregnant women with phosphatidylcholine (the main dietary source of choline) improves the cognitive abilities of their offspring. Design: In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 140 pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive supplemental phosphatidylcholine (750 mg) or a placebo (corn oil) from 18 wk gestation through 90 d postpartum. Their infants (n = 99) were tested for short-term visuospatial memory, long-term episodic memory, language development, and global development at 10 and 12 mo of age. Results: The women studied ate diets that delivered ‚àº360 mg choline/d in foods (‚àº80% of the recommended intake for pregnant women, 65% of the recommended intake for lactating women). The phosphatidylcholine supplements were well tolerated. Groups did not differ significantly in global development, language development, short-term visuospatial memory, or long-term episodic memory. Conclusions: Phosphatidylcholine supplementation of pregnant women eating diets containing moderate amounts of choline did not enhance their infants' brain function. It is possible that a longer follow-up period would reveal late-emerging effects. Moreover, future studies should determine whether supplementing mothers eating diets much lower in choline content, such as those consumed in several low-income countries, would enhance infant brain development.

325,Prematurity and school readiness in a nationally representative sample of Australian children: Does typically occurring preschool moderate the relationship,"Objective: This study aims to examine the relationship between indicators of prematurity and children's cognitive and behavioral school readiness in a nationally representative sample and to investigate whether typically occurring preschool enrollment moderates this relationship, particularly for children from disadvantaged families in Australia. Methods: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children is a nationally representative prospective sample of two cohorts of children with sequentially obtained indicators of child health and developmental outcomes. We analyzed information on 8060 children aged 4-5. years who had complete data on birth weight, gestational age, prenatal risks, social factors, and cognitive and behavioral outcomes of school readiness. Multivariate regressions were used to relate three indicators of prematurity (low birth weight, preterm birth, and small for gestational age) to cognitive and behavioral school readiness. Results: Children born preterm, small for gestational age, or with low birth weight have significantly lower cognitive school readiness after controlling for social factors and prenatal risks. None of the premature indicators were associated with behavioral school readiness. All children benefited from attending preschool. Yet, preschool enrollment did not moderate the relationship between prematurity and school readiness. The only exception is for small for gestational age survivors with low educated mothers. Preschool enrollment was associated with an increase in cognitive school readiness skills. Conclusions: Prematurity was associated with lower cognitive school readiness skills. Typical occurring preschool did not eliminate this association. Findings suggest that simply expanding the preschool enrollment is inadequate to address the developmental needs of premature children from disadvantaged backgrounds. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Chen, J.

In stage one, an item pool was created for the AHT awareness questionnaire. Four experts assessed the content validity. Test‚Äìretest reliability and internal consistency were examined using a pilot study of 24 healthcare professionals. In stage two, 302 healthcare professionals from a medical centre in southern Taiwan were recruited to establish the questionnaire's psychometric properties. The final version of the questionnaire comprised 81 items, including demographics, attitudes towards childrearing and four sub‚Äêconcepts on AHT awareness (infant crying, soothing skills, clinical manifestations and consequences of AHT, and risk factors of AHT). The content validity of the questionnaire was satisfactory with a score of 0.91 to 1.0 for the scale content validity index. The test‚Äìretest reliability was 0.51‚Äì0.71. Cronbach's alphas for the final sample were 0.52‚Äì0.93 for the four subscales. Exploratory factor analysis extracted two factors as risk factors of AHT with a total explained variance of 55.9 per cent. This questionnaire is useful in understanding AHT awareness with identified aspects among healthcare professionals and other professionals working in child protection fields. Items and subscales of the AHT awareness questionnaire could act as a reference guide for future training programmes. ‚ÄòThis two‚Äêstage study aimed to develop and validate a paediatric abusive head trauma (AHT) awareness questionnaire for healthcare professionals‚Äô Key Practitioner Messages We developed and validated a questionnaire to assess healthcare professionals' awareness of paediatric AHT.

327,Daily touchscreen use in infants and toddlers is associated with reduced sleep and delayed sleep onset,"Traditional screen time (e.g. TV and videogaming) has been linked to sleep problems and poorer developmental outcomes in children. With the advent of portable touchscreen devices, this association may be extending down in age to disrupt the sleep of infants and toddlers, an age when sleep is essential for cognitive development. However, this association has not been demonstrated empirically. This study aims to examine whether frequency of touchscreen use is associated with sleep in infants and toddlers between 6 and 36 months of age. An online survey was administered to 715 parents reporting on child media use (daily exposure to TV and use of touchscreens), sleep patterns (night-time and daytime sleep duration, sleep onset-time to fall asleep, and frequencies of night awakenings). Structural equation models controlling for age, sex, TV exposure and maternal education indicated a significant association between touchscreen use and night-time sleep, daytime sleep and sleep onset. No significant effect was observed for the number of night awakenings. To our knowledge, this is the first report linking the use of touchscreen with sleep problems in infants and toddlers. Future longitudinal studies are needed to clarify the direction of effects and the mechanisms underlying these associations using detailed sleep tracking. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).","Cheung, C. H.

329,"Mothers' perception and management of abdominal colic in infants in Enugu, Nigeria","BACKGROUND: Abdominal colic is common in infants but generally harmless. The exact aetiology is unknown but it has been associated with vicious cycle of crying and swallowing of air by the infant. The excessive crying associated with it can result in a lot of distress for family members creating unnecessary panics. We sought to find the perception and management of abdominal colic by mothers in Enugu. OBJECTIVE: Objective of this study is to determine the perception and 'home management' of abdominal colic in infants by mothers in Enugu, south-east Nigeria and the factors associated with them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey involving 177 mothers that presented with their infants at the pediatric outpatient clinic of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Ituku Ozalla, Enugu between June and November 2011. A pretested questionnaire was used after obtaining their consent. RESULTS: A total of one hundred and seventy-seven mothers participated in this study. They were aged 20 to 60 years with mean age of 34 ¬± 7.3 years. Most of them (99.4%) believed that babies can have abdominal colic. While 41.3% attributed no problems to colic, the rest believed that it causes loose/greenish stools (12.4%), fever (16.4%) and vomiting (9.6%) etc. Most of the mothers (87.7%) do apply medications for colic which range from paracetamol (33.1%), Gbomoro (16.2%), teething powder (15.4%), salt water (13.2%), Buscopan (7.7%) and gripe water (4.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Mothers attribute symptoms of childhood illnesses to abdominal colic. This may have led to unnecessary and sometimes harmful management. There is need for health education of mothers and potential mothers.","Chinawa, J. M. and Ubesie, A. C. and Adimora, G. N. and Obu, H. A. and Eke, C. B.",0,266

332,Maternal Depressive Symptoms and Developmental Delay at Age 2: A Diverse Population-Based Longitudinal Study,"Objectives: Children raised by depressed mothers perform lower on measures of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral skills, compared to children of non-depressed mothers. It is unclear how maternal depressive symptoms (MDS), which persist and accrue over time, impact child development. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cumulative MDS from pre-pregnancy to postpartum influences child development in children by age 2.5. Methods: Using a longitudinal population-based study design, 2679 racially and ethnically diverse mothers completed the 2014 Los Angeles Mommy and Baby (LAMB) and 2016 Follow-Up surveys. A total MDS score was created based on responses to standardized questions, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). Data was collected for before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and 4¬†months postpartum in the 2014 survey, and at 2.5¬†years postpartum in the 2016 survey. Child development was measured using the CDC‚Äôs Learn the Signs. Act Early Milestones Checklist. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were conducted. Results: The prevalence of any cumulative MDS was 45.2%. Language, cognitive/adaptive, motor, and social-emotional delays for surveyed toddlers were 7.7%, 4.0%, 1.2%, and 14.2%. After adjusting for covariates, mothers reporting depressive symptoms at all four time points were significantly more likely to report a social-emotional delay in their child (aOR = 4.39, 95% CI ‚àí¬†1.72 to 11.18). Conclusions for Practice: Mothers with cumulative depressive symptoms are at-risk of reporting social-emotional delays by age 2.5. Understanding these effects may help direct resources to target interventions that support mothers with depressive symptoms early-on and promote positive developmental outcomes among their children. ¬© 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Chorbadjian, T.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-blind cross over study in which total 140 neonates were enrolled. Pain stimulus was given in the form of heel-lance before and after giving KMC and data were recorded. RESULTS: The effect of KMC on heart rate variability was statistically significant in preterm (30-34 wks) and very low birth weight (1.0-1.5‚Äâkg) neonates. The mean fall in SpO2 from base line was less in KMC group as compared to without KMC group at 60‚Äâs (1.63% versus 2.22%) and 120‚Äâs (0.45% versus 2.22%). The mean duration of cry was less in the KMC group (15.05‚Äâs) as compared to without KMC group (24.82‚Äâs) and the difference was statistically significant (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). The mean duration of cry was reduced by 36% in KMC group as compared to the without KMC group. The effect of KMC on pain scores (premature infant pain profile (PIPP)) were significantly lower after heel-lance in KMC at 60‚Äâs (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.01). CONCLUSION: KMC is a most physiological, non-pharmacological and easy intervention that involves parents: to manage procedural pain that can be implemented for physiological or behavioral stability in their premature infants.","Choudhary, M. and Dogiyal, H. and Sharma, D. and Datt Gupta, B. and Madabhavi, I. and Choudhary, J.

335,Exposure to BPA in children-media-based and biomonitoring-based approaches,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in numerous industrial and consumer product applications resulting in ubiquitous exposure. Children's exposure is of particular concern because of evidence of developmental effects. Childhood exposure is estimated for different age groups in two ways. The ""forward"" approach uses information on BPA concentrations in food and other environmental media (air, water, etc.) combined with average contact rates for each medium. The ""backward"" approach relies on urinary biomonitoring, extrapolating backward to the intake which would have led to the observed biomarker level. The forward analysis shows that BPA intakes are dominated by canned food consumption, and that intakes are higher for younger ages. Mean intake estimates ranged from ~125 ng/kg-day for 1 year-olds to ~73 ng/kg-day among 16-20 years olds. Biomonitoring-based intakes show the same trend of lower intakes for older children, with an estimate of 121 (median) to 153 (mean) ng/kg-day for 2-6 years, compared with 33 (median) to 53-66 (mean) ng/kg-day for 16-20 years. Infant intakes were estimated to range from ~46 to 137 ng/kg-day. Recognizing uncertainties and limitations, this analysis suggests that the ""forward"" and ""backward"" methods provide comparable results and identify canned foods as a potentially important source of BPA exposure for children. ¬© 2014 by the authors.","Christensen, K.

337,Caregiver perceptions of child development in rural Madagascar: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Human capital (the knowledge, skills, and health that accumulate over life) can be optimized by investments in early childhood to promote cognitive and language development. Parents and caregivers play a crucial role in the promotion and support of cognitive development in their children. Thus, understanding caregiver perceptions of a child's capabilities and attributes, including intelligence, may enhance investments early in life. To explore this question, we asked caregivers to rank their child's intelligence in comparison with other children in the community, and compared this ranking with children's scores on an assessment of developmental abilities across multiple domains. Methods: Our study examined cross-sectional data of 3361 children aged 16-42 months in rural Madagascar. Child intelligence, as perceived by their caregiver, was captured using a ladder ranking scale based on the MacArthur Scale for Subjective Social Status. Children's developmental abilities were assessed using scores from the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Inventory (ASQ-I), which measures cognitive, language, and socio-emotional development. Ranked percentiles of the ASQ-I were generated within communities and across the whole sample. We created categories of under-estimation, matched, and over-estimation by taking the differences in rankings between caregiver-perceived child intelligence and ASQ-I. Child nutritional status, caregiver belief of their influence on child intelligence, and sociodemographic factors were examined as potential correlates of discordance between the measures using multinomial logistic regressions. Results: We found caregiver perceptions of intelligence in Madagascar did not align consistently with the ASQ-I, with approximately 8% of caregivers under-estimating and almost 50% over-estimating their children's developmental abilities. Child nutritional status, caregiver belief of their influence on child intelligence, caregiver education, and wealth were associated with under- or over-estimation of children's developmental abilities. Conclusions: Our findings suggest parents may not always have an accurate perception of their child's intelligence or abilities compared with other children. The results are consistent with the limited literature on parental perceptions of child nutrition, which documents a discordance between caregiver perceptions and objective measures. Further research is needed to understand the common cues caregivers that use to identify child development milestones and how these may differ from researcher-observed measures in low-income settings.

Prior research is mixed on how grandmother involvement influences child outcomes and there is a paucity of research on grandmother caregiving in low-income and middle-income countries. We examined the role of grandmother involvement on child growth and development in the first 2 years of life cross sectionally and longitudinally in rural Pakistan. Methods We used data from the Bachpan Cohort, a longitudinal birth cohort in rural Pakistan. Maternally reported grandmother involvement in daily instrumental and non-instrumental caregiving was collected at 3 and 12 months.

Material and Method: The study was conducted in a Mother and Child Health Centre in ƒ∞stanbul in May- October 2006. All 364 mothers who were registered in the health centre were enrolled. A total of 358 mothers were included in the study. Results: The frequencies of breastfeeding initiation and of breastfeeding within the first hour were 98.9%and 62.3%respectively. Among the babies older than 6 months (n=200), 52.5%were weaned before 6 months. Pacifier use (OR: 3.01, 95%CI: 1.35-6.69), being preterm (OR: 3.36, 95%CI: 1.04-10.79), having a job (OR: 2.83, 95%CI: 1.14- 7.04) or smoking (OR: 2.27, 95%CI: 1.01-5.14) were found to be risk factors for early weaning. Conclusion: Although the frequency of initiating breastfeeding is very high, the continuation duration is below the World Health Organization (WHO)'s recommendations. Physicians and other health workers should strongly recommend against smoking during prenatal and postnatal visits. Physicians should not support pacifiers, until we have sufficient data to support its benefits. In order to increase the duration of breast feeding, health professionals should focus on preterm babies, smoking or working mothers.","√áif√ßili, S. Y. and Akg√ºn, T.

Parents recorded a baseline state-of-arousal diary for 3 days using their usual feeding methods, and then they used six study-provided bottles for 2 weeks while recording a second state-of-arousal diary. Infants being fed with placebo bottles significantly spent more time crying (œÅ = .010) and fussing (œÅ = .002) on average than infants using Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Baby Bottles. Because these bottles decreased the time the infants spent crying and fussing, use of these bottles may be recommended for colicky infants who receive any bottle feedings.","Cirgin Ellett, M.

344,Development of emotional and behavioral regulation in children born extremely preterm and very preterm: Biological and social influences,"This study describes the development of emotional and behavioral regulation in a regional cohort of children born extremely preterm (<28 weeks gestational age, n = 39), very preterm (<34 weeks gestational age, n = 56), and full term (n = 103). At 2 and 4 years, children born at younger gestational ages demonstrated poorer self-regulation across multiple contexts spanning observed interactions, formal cognitive testing, and parental report of child behavior at home. Among children born preterm, the 2 strongest predictors of impairments in self-regulation were the presence of moderate-to-severe cerebral white matter abnormalities on neonatal magnetic resonance and a less sensitive parenting style when children were aged 2 years. Findings support the importance of early neurological development and parenting for developing regulation in children born very preterm. ¬© 2008, Society for Research in Child Development, Inc.","Clark, C.

353,Stress and coping in fathers of newborns: comparisons of planned versus unplanned pregnancy,"The purpose of this survey was to identify stresses and coping styles in fathers of newborns, and to explore if these vary according to pregnancy planning. Data from 69 subjects were collected using the Ireton Personal Inventory and the Jalowiec Coping Scale. The most common and least often sources of stress or worry were reported. Fathers' predominant mode of coping was problem oriented. Compared to fathers with planned pregnancies, fathers with unplanned pregnancies were found to be significantly more stressed about numerous issues as well as feeling powerless in adapting to the arrival of a new infant. Implications for practice and research are explored.     The aim was to assess among new fathers their stresses and coping styles and to ascertain whether there was different behavior in planned versus unplanned pregnancies. The study was confined to 69 fathers with 4-6 week health infants and no other children less than one year old, and who had no prior history of institutionalization for mental health problems. Fathers were recruited from the community at large. The sample included 68% (47) planned and 32% (22) unplanned pregnancies. The mean age of the fathers was 29 years. There was wide spectrum of income levels. 88% were White, 5% Black, 2% Asian, 3% Hispanic, and 2% American Indian. 90% were married. Marriage duration averaged 2.5 years. The Ireton Personal Inventory and the Jalowiec Coping Scale were administered at the School of Nursing at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. The results indicated that the stress centered around work, family health, finances, and children. Friendships and marital situation held the least stress.

Developmental systems suggest maintenance through strong contextual constraints, perturbed only by unusual alterations in social demands and light exposure, such as shift work. Retrospective data from university students, employing the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ), supported predicted continuity of sleep/wake patterns and associated states of alertness and fatigue as a function of time of day as well as relations with different patterns of social interactions with parents over daily routines in childhood and adolescence. Eveningness is related to greater difficulty meeting familial and social demands for morning performance than Morningness.","Cofer, L. F. and Grice, J. W. and Sethre-Hofstad, L. and Radi, C.

357,"Evaluating the Alimentary and Respiratory Tracts in Health and disease (EARTH) research programme: a protocol for prospective, longitudinal, controlled, observational studies in children with chronic disease at an Australian tertiary paediatric hospital","Introduction Chronic gastrointestinal and respiratory conditions of childhood can have long-lasting physical, psychosocial and economic effects on children and their families. Alterations in diet and intestinal and respiratory microbiomes may have important implications for physical and psychosocial health. Diet influences the intestinal microbiome and should be considered when exploring disease-specific alterations. The concepts of gut-brain and gut-lung axes provide novel perspectives for examining chronic childhood disease(s). We established the ' Evaluating the Alimentary and Respiratory Tracts in Health and disease' (EARTH) research programme to provide a structured, holistic evaluation of children with chronic gastrointestinal and/or respiratory conditions. Methods and analysis The EARTH programme provides a framework for a series of prospective, longitudinal, controlled, observational studies (comprised of individual substudies), conducted at an Australian tertiary paediatric hospital (the methodology is applicable to other settings). Children with a chronic gastrointestinal and/or respiratory condition will be compared with age and gender matched healthy controls (HC) across a 12-month period. The following will be collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months: (i) stool, (ii) oropharyngeal swab/sputum, (iii) semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, (iv) details of disease symptomatology, (v) health-related quality of life and (vi) psychosocial factors. Data on the intestinal and respiratory microbiomes and diet will be compared between children with a condition and HC. Correlations between dietary intake (energy, macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients), intestinal and respiratory microbiomes within each group will be explored. Data on disease symptomatology, quality of life and psychosocial factors will be compared between condition and HC cohorts. Results will be hypothesis-generating and direct future focussed studies. There is future potential for direct translation into clinical care, as diet is a highly modifiable factor.

361,Emergence behaviour in children: defining the incidence of excitement and agitation following anaesthesia,"BACKGROUND: Children display a variety of behaviour during anaesthetic recovery. The purpose of this study was to study the frequency and duration of emergence behaviour in children following anaesthesia and the factors that alter the incidence of various emergence behaviour following anaesthesia. METHODS: A prospective study of children who required outpatient lower abdominal surgery was designed to determine an incidence and duration of emergence agitation. We developed a 5-point scoring scale to study the postanaesthetic behaviour in these children. The scale included behaviour from asleep (score=1) to disorientation and severe restlessness (score=5). Children were scored by a blinded observer every 10 min during the first hour of recovery or until discharge from same day surgery. RESULTS: We found 27 of 260 children experienced a period of severe restlessness and disorientation (score 5) during anaesthesia emergence. Thirty percent of the children (79/260) experienced a period of inconsolable crying or severe restlessness (score 4 or 5) following anaesthesia. The frequency of this behaviour was greatest on arrival in the recovery room, but many children who arrived asleep in the recovery room later experienced a period of agitation or inconsolable crying. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated assessments of behaviour following anaesthetic recovery are required to define an incidence and duration of emergence agitation. Emergence agitation occurs most frequently in the initial 10 min of recovery, but many children who arrive asleep experience agitation later during recovery.","Cole, J. W. and Murray, D.

362,Developmental effects on sleep‚Äìwake patterns in infants receiving a cow‚Äôs milk-based infant formula with an added prebiotic blend: a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Few studies have evaluated nutritive effects of prebiotics on infant behavior state, physiology, or metabolic status. Methods: In this double-blind randomized study, infants (n = 161) received cow‚Äôs milk-based infant formula (Control) or similar formula with an added prebiotic blend (polydextrose and galactooligosaccharides [PDX/GOS]) from 14‚Äì35 to 112 days of age. Infant wake behavior (crying/fussing, awake/content) and 24-h sleep‚Äìwake actograms were analyzed (Baseline, Days 70 and 112). Salivary cortisol was immunoassayed (Days 70 and 112). In a subset, exploratory stool 16S ribosomal RNA-sequencing was analyzed (Baseline, Day 112). Results: One hundred and thirty-one infants completed the study. Average duration of crying/fussing episodes was similar at Baseline, significantly shorter for PDX/GOS vs. Control at Day 70, and the trajectory continued at Day 112. Latency to first and second nap was significantly longer for PDX/GOS vs. Control at Day 112. Cortisol awakening response was demonstrated at Days 70 and 112. Significant stool microbiome beta-diversity and individual taxa abundance differences were observed in the PDX/GOS group. Conclusions: Results indicate faster consolidation of daytime waking state in infants receiving prebiotics and support home-based actigraphy to assess early sleep‚Äìwake patterns. A prebiotic effect on wake organization is consistent with influence on the gut‚Äìbrain axis and warrants further investigation. Impact: Few studies have evaluated nutritive effects of prebiotics on infant behavior state, cortisol awakening response, sleep‚Äìwake entrainment, and gut microbiome.Faster consolidation of daytime waking state was demonstrated in infants receiving a prebiotic blend in infant formula through ~4 months of age.Shorter episodes of crying were demonstrated at ~2 months of age (time point corresponding to age/developmental range associated with peak crying) in infants receiving formula with added prebiotics.Results support home-based actigraphy as a suitable method to assess early sleep‚Äìwake patterns.Prebiotic effect on wake organization is consistent with influence on the gut‚Äìbrain axis and warrants further investigation. ¬© 2020, The Author(s).","Colombo, J. and Carlson, S.

364,Caregiver Opinion of In-Hospital Screening for Unmet Social Needs by Pediatric Residents,"Objective Child health is strongly influenced by social determinants. Little is known about the opinions of primary caregivers regarding the physicians' role in addressing social needs. Our objective was to examine caregivers' opinions about that role and any associations between those opinions, previous exposure to screening for needs by pediatric residents, and socioeconomic status (SES). Methods Cross-sectional survey study of caregivers of hospitalized children. The survey collected information on caregiver opinion regarding their ability to ask physicians for help with social needs, whether physicians know how to help with those needs, and whether physicians should ask about social needs. The chi square test was used to identify associations between caregiver opinions, prior screening by a resident at admission, and SES (determined by census tract median household income). Results Surveys were completed by 143 caregivers (79% participation). Most respondents agreed that they could ask their physician for help (54.5%), that their physician knows how to help (64.3%), and that physicians should ask about social needs (71.3%). Previously screened caregivers had more favorable opinions about asking for help (76.2% vs 45.5%, P <.01), whether their physician knows how to help (81.0% vs 57.4%, P =.02), and physician screening for unmet needs (85.7% vs 65.3%, P =.03). There were no SES differences in opinion. Conclusions Caregivers have favorable opinions of the physician's role in addressing the social determinants of health, especially after being screened. Physicians should be confident in the acceptability of screening families for social needs. ¬© 2016 Academic Pediatric Association.","Colvin, J. D. and Bettenhausen, J. L. and Anderson-Carpenter, K.

366,Evaluation of infantile acid and nonacid gastroesophageal reflux using combined pH monitoring and impedance measurement,"OBJECTIVE: Characterize the proportion of acid and nonacid esophageal reflux events in young infants with suspected gastroesophageal reflux (GER) using combined pH-multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) monitoring. Determine the symptom index correlation with nonacid reflux and acid reflux events. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of children, aged 2 weeks to 1 year, referred to The Children's Hospital of Denver Gastroenterology Clinic for evaluation of GER. Exclusion criteria were congenital anomalies or syndromes, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and pulmonary or cardiac disease. The children were admitted to The Children's Hospital General Clinical Research Center for a 20 hour pH-MII study. Acid suppression was either never used or discontinued 2 weeks before testing. RESULTS: Thirty-four infants were enrolled from February 2004 to February 2005. Ages ranged from 2 months to 11 months, median = 7 (20 females/14 males). One thousand eight hundred ninety reflux events were detected by MII, and 588 reflux events were detected by pH probe alone. The percent of reflux that was acid was 47% (888 events) versus 53% of (1,002 events) nonacid reflux events. The proportion of nonacid reflux decreased with age (P < 0.0001 by Pearson chi test) and with increasing time elapsed from last meal. There were 958 total symptoms evaluated. The most frequently reported symptom was fussiness/pain, which correlated with nonacid reflux events 24.6% and acid reflux 25.2%. The proximal height of a reflux was predictive for symptoms of fussiness/pain, arching, and burping. CONCLUSION: MII detects more reflux events than pH monitoring alone. The proportion of nonacid reflux to acid reflux events in infants is more similar to adults than previously reported. Combined pH-MII esophageal monitoring identifies more reflux events and improves clinical correlation with symptoms.","Condino, A.

367,Sex differences: A study of the ear of the beholder,"Conducted an experiment in which 32 high school seniors and 8 college students, while performing an unrelated task, heard a single infant awakening. Ss were randomly assigned to 2 conditions of attributed sex in which the infant was labeled either as a girl or a boy. The dependent variable was how quickly Ss responded to the crying infant. Females responded more quickly to the girl than to the boy. Males responded equally slowly to boy and girl. A questionnaire on sex differences in fragility showed that females and males tended to disagree with the proposition that girls are more fragile than boys. Thus, the females' faster response to a crying girl cannot be accounted for by a belief in sex-differential fragility. Correlations between fragility beliefs and response times to an infant indicate that sex-differential belief‚Äìbehavior relationships are not the same for males and females.

370,Management of dysphonia in children,"BACKGROUND: Dysphonia is common in children, but practice varies considerably regarding what, if any, investigations are performed and how the condition is managed. Although childhood dysphonia is mostly due to non-serious causes such as voice misuse, very serious pathology such as papillomatosis or malignancy needs occasionally to be excluded, and treatable congenital anomalies such as webs and cysts can be missed. Voice clinics and voice therapy services are now well established in most adult health services in the developed world, but equivalent services for children are less common, at least in the UK. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all children presenting to our large children's hospital with a primary complaint of dysphonia between January 2001 and October 2007, in order to determine their management, investigations and final diagnosis. RESULTS: We identified 142 children. Case records were found for 137 (97 per cent). Eight-three children were male (61 per cent) and 54 female (39 per cent). Ages ranged from two months to 15 years (median 5.3 years). In 10 children (7 per cent), hoarseness was congenital, presenting as a hoarse, weak cry at birth. In 15 children (11 per cent), onset of hoarseness was related to a specific surgical procedure. The larynx was visualised by mirror alone in 23 children (17 per cent), by awake fibre-optic laryngoscopy in 27 (20 per cent) and by microlaryngoscopy-bronchoscopy under anaesthesia in 42 (31 per cent). Forty children (29 per cent) did not undergo laryngeal visualisation at any time and were diagnosed based on history alone. A further five (4 per cent) were scheduled for direct laryngoscopy but this was not performed due to resolution of symptoms. Voice abuse accounted for 62 (45 per cent) of all diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood dysphonia accounts for a large number of referrals. There is considerable variation in how these children are managed. A more structured approach to diagnosis and investigation would be beneficial, perhaps within the setting of a dedicated paediatric voice clinic.","Connelly, A. and Clement, W.

372,Effectiveness of skin-to-skin contact versus care-as-usual in mothers and their full-term infants: Study protocol for a parallel-group randomized controlled trial,"Background: Twenty-to-forty percent of women experience postpartum depressive symptoms, which can affect both the mother and infant. In preterm infants, daily skin-to-skin contact (SSC) between the mother and her infant has been shown to decrease maternal postpartum depressive symptoms. In full-term infants, only two studies investigated SSC effects on maternal depressive symptoms and found similar results. Research in preterm infants also showed that SSC improves other mental and physical health outcomes of the mother and the infant, and improves the quality of mother-infant relationship. This randomized controlled trial will investigate the effects of a SSC intervention on maternal postpartum depressive symptoms and additional outcomes in mothers and their full-term infants. Moreover, two potential underlying mechanisms for the relation between SSC and the maternal and infant outcomes will be examined, namely maternal oxytocin concentrations and infant intestinal microbiota. Methods/design: Design: A parallel-group randomized controlled trial. Participants: 116 mothers and their full-term infants. Intervention: Mothers in the SSC condition will be requested to provide daily at least one continuous hour of SSC to their infant. The intervention starts immediately after birth and lasts for 5 weeks. Mothers in the control condition will not be requested to provide SSC. Maternal and infant outcomes will be measured at 2 weeks, 5 weeks, 12 weeks and 1 year after birth. Primary outcome: maternal postpartum depressive symptoms. Secondary maternal outcomes: mental health (anxiety, stress, traumatic stress following child birth, sleep quality), physical health (physical recovery from the delivery, health, breastfeeding, physiological stress), mother-infant relationship (mother-infant bond, quality of maternal caregiving behavior). Secondary infant outcomes: behavior (fussing and crying, sleep quality), physical health (growth and health, physiological stress), general development (regulation capacities, social-emotional capacities, language, cognitive and motor capacities). Secondary underlying mechanisms: maternal oxytocin concentrations, infant intestinal microbiota. Discussion: As a simple and cost-effective intervention, SSC may benefit both the mother and her full-term infant in the short-and long-term. Additionally, if SSC is shown to be effective in low-risk mother-infant dyads, then thought could be given to developing programs in high-risk samples and using SSC in a preventive manner.

373,Baby Business: A randomised controlled trial of a universal parenting program that aims to prevent early infant sleep and cry problems and associated parental depression,"Background: Infant crying and sleep problems (e.g. frequent night waking, difficulties settling to sleep) each affect up to 30% of infants and often co-exist. They are costly to manage and associated with adverse outcomes including postnatal depression symptoms, early weaning from breast milk, and later child behaviour problems. Preventing such problems could improve these adverse outcomes and reduce costs to families and the health care system. Anticipatory guidance-i.e. providing parents with information about normal infant sleep and cry patterns, ways to encourage self-settling in infants, and ways to develop feeding and settling routines before the onset of problems-could prevent such problems. This paper outlines the protocol for our study which aims to test an anticipatory guidance approach.Methods/Design: 750 families from four Local Government Areas in Melbourne, Australia have been randomised to receive the Baby Business program (intervention group) or usual care (control group) offered by health services. The Baby Business program provides parents with information about infant sleep and crying via a DVD and booklet (mailed soon after birth), telephone consultation (at infant age 6-8 weeks) and parent group session (at infant age 12 weeks). All English speaking parents of healthy newborn infants born at > 32 weeks gestation and referred by their maternal and child health nurse at their first post partum home visit (day 7-10 postpartum), are eligible. The primary outcome is parent report of infant night time sleep as a problem at four months of age and secondary outcomes include parent report of infant daytime sleep or crying as a problem, mean duration of infant sleep and crying/24 hours, parental depression symptoms, parent sleep quality and quantity and health service use. Data will be collected at two weeks (baseline), four months and six months of age. An economic evaluation using a cost-consequences approach will, from a societal perspective, compare costs and health outcomes between the intervention and control groups.Discussion: To our knowledge this is the first randomised controlled trial of a program which aims to prevent both infant sleeping and crying problems and associated postnatal depression symptoms. If effective, it could offer an important public health prevention approach to these common, distressing problems.Trial registration number: ISRCTN: ISRCTN63834603. ¬© 2012 Cook et al","Cook, F. and Bayer, J. and Le, H.

Digital technology offers platforms for making such programs widely available in a cost-efficient manner. However, it remains unclear who accesses online parenting advice and in particular, whether the parents who would most benefit are represented amongst users. It is also unknown whether the uptake of online programs can be improved by health professional recommendations, or whether parents require additional prompts and reminders to use the program. In this study we aim to: (1) determine whether weekly email prompts increase engagement with and use of a brief online program about infant sleeping and crying, (2) determine whether encouragement from a maternal and child health nurse promotes greater engagement with and use of the program, (3) examine who uses a brief online program about infant sleeping and crying","Cook, F. and Seymour, M. and Giallo, R. and Cann, W. and Nicholson, J.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of healthy children (9 months to 7 years) who underwent BMT at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia or its ambulatory surgery centers from 2013 to 2016. Anesthetic care included preoperative oral midazolam, sevoflurane/nitrous oxide (N2O)/air/oxygen (O2) by mask, and intramuscular ketorolac. Demographic and procedural information included left and right tympanic membrane (normal, retracted, or bulging) and middle ear (normal/no, serous, mucoid, or purulent effusion) conditions. Because tympanic membrane and middle ear conditions were highly concordant and mean maximum Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC) scores (0-10) were not different across the array of abnormal findings, we categorized each ear as normal or abnormal based on middle ear effusion alone. We then defined the ear condition of each child (primary exposure) using bilateral findings: normal/normal, normal/abnormal, and abnormal/abnormal. Secondary exposures included age, BMT history, procedure duration, facility location, and attending surgeon/anesthesiologist pair. The primary outcome was maximum postanesthesia care unit FLACC score: 4-10 (moderate-to-severe pain) versus 0-3 (no-to-low pain). Rescue oxycodone, acetaminophen administration, and emergence agitation were secondary outcomes. Statistical analysis incorporated generalized linear mixed models with random intercepts accounting for the clustering effect of provider pairs. Adjusting for multiple comparisons, significance level was set at P = .004. RESULTS: Excluding recurrent cases, 1922 unique evaluable subjects remained. The probability of moderate-to-severe pain behavior (FLACC, 4-10) was 52.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50.2-54.6) overall. In a confounder-adjusted model, ear condition was significantly associated with moderate-to-severe pain: compared to bilateral abnormal (effusions), odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) for bilateral normal was 2.2 (1.6-2.9), P < .0001.

379,Explaining infant feeding style of low-income black women,"Unstructured interviews were conducted with 10 low-income black women to explore infant feeding style. Formula-feeding with early introduction of cereal in the bottle was the most common pattern used by mothers in the first 3 months. By 6 months, formula-fed infants had a complex diet of a variety of foods. Half the women intended to breast-feed, but only one exclusively breast-fed. Beliefs about healthy infants and crying influenced feeding. There was a lack of knowledge about and support for breast-feeding in these women's environment. Support and advice about infant feeding from the health care system were uneven.","Corbett, K. S.",0,304
380,Maternal depression and the experience of parenting in the second postnatal year,"Cognitive theories of depression maintain that negative thoughts about the self and of the future are central features of depression. In postnatal depression, these negative thoughts may impact upon the mother's experience of parenting. This study investigated the impact of maternal depression during the first postnatal year and beyond and infant gender on parenting stress, on the mother's feelings of attachment to her infant and on her perceptions of her infant's behaviour. One hundred and twelve generally well-educated middle-class mothers who had presented with unsettled infant behaviour to a parent-craft hospital, were interviewed and completed questionnaires when their infants were 4, 12 and 15 months of age. Mothers who had experienced depression reported higher levels of parenting stress at 15 months than never depressed mothers. Only mothers who had experienced chronic depression (‚â•12 months duration), however, reorted higher parenting stress related to characteristics of their infants. They also reported significantly more negative perceptions of their infant's behaviour and more hostile feelings towards their infants than never depressed mothers. Results are discussed with respect to the impact of the duration of depression on the mothers' reported experiences of parenting and the clinical implications of these findings. ¬© 2006 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.","Cornish, A.

381,"Sickness behavior in feverish children is independent of the severity of fever. An observational, multicenter study","BACKGROUND. OBJECTIVES: Behavioral changes in a febrile child are usually considered to stem from the fever. We studied sickness behavior (SB) in terms of its clinical components and its relation to fever. METHODS: This observational, multicenter study included children aged 6 months to 3 years who were either febrile (fever ‚â•12 hours, ‚â• 39¬∞C and ‚â•38¬∞C at inclusion) or non-febrile and well. The child had to have been awake for the 2 hours preceding the consultation and cared for by the parent who brought him/her to the doctor. SB was evaluated according to 6 parameters over this 2-hour period: time spent playing, distance covered, time spent seeking comfort, time spent whining or crying, time spent in a state of irritation or of anger, most distorted facial expression. Two parameters were assessed for the 24-hour period preceding the consultation: time spent sleeping and appetite. The parent reported the degree of change in these parameters compared with the usual situation, using rating scales. RESULTS: 200 febrile children (most with nonspecific upper respiratory infections) and 200 non-febrile children were included. The mean values of the 8 parameters differed significantly (p<0.001) between the 2 groups and were independent of the height of fever at inclusion in the febrile children. In the study conditions, paracetamol failed to improve SB when the child was still feverish. CONCLUSION: The 8 parameters suggested that SB and fever are two independent manifestations that are activated simultaneously during an infection. This independence is in harmony with recommendations to treat the discomfort of SB and not the fever.","Corrard, F. and Copin, C. and Wollner, A. and Elbez, A. and Derkx, V. and Bechet, S. and Levy, C. and Boucherat, M. and Cohen, R.",0,306
382,A review of excessive infant crying,"Background: The objective of this review is to situate the study of excessive crying in the wider context of early emotion regulation research and to examine the extent to which converging findings from across the infant literature support a developmental, neuro-bio-behavioural-interactional framework for the understanding of this phenomenon in its typical, extreme, and persistent manifestations. Methodology: A review of databases using terms related to infant crying was conducted. The selection of empirical and theoretical papers was drawn from within and beyond the 'infant crying' literature, in keeping with the integrative aim to examine excessive infant crying in a larger developmental and theoretical context. Conclusion: That excessive infant crying in the first three months is a normal, although extreme, multi-determined developmental phenomenon, most effectively explained in terms of maturational change and multi-directional influences across systems intrinsic and extrinsic to the infant. This conceptualisation suggests that the search for discrete, single level causes is futile. A systemic approach to research, assessment and treatment is therefore warranted. Considerable evidence points to the importance of sensory experiences in infant regulation","Cotton, L. and Milne, L.",0,307
383,A comparison of fetal outcome in birth chair and delivery table births,"This study was conducted to determine the effect of the birth chair on fetal outcome in primigravid subjects with a normal pregnancy and labor. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare 33 birth-chair deliveries with 22 delivery-table deliveries. No difference between groups was found in the mean pH and pO2 of arterial and venous cord blood samples. The mean arterial pCO2 was lower in the chair group (49.25 and 44.50, p = 0.023), but there was no difference in venous pCO2. In the chair group, the mean vein pO2 was higher when the angle of the chair was more than 45 degrees upright (22.3 and 28.4, p = 0.007). Means for chair and table groups were similar for maternal hemoglobin, breathholding while pushing, duration of second stage, time of first cry, time of cord clamping, and Apgar scores. Incidence of cord around the neck was identical. The mean one-minute Apgar scores were significantly higher when chair or table was more than 30 degrees upright (8.0 and 8.59, p = 0.037). Results suggest that the birth chair is a safe alternative to the delivery table in terms of fetal outcome. The findings of lower arterial pCO2 with unchanged pO2 and pH in the chair group, support earlier findings of less transient cord compression in upright positions.","Cottrell, B. H. and Shannahan, M.

384,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for the treatment of postpartum depression,"Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a common and gravely disabling health concern. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an FDA approved treatment for major depression and may be a valuable tool in the treatment of PPD. The treatment effect of rTMS is rapid, generally well tolerated, without systemic effects, and without medication exposure to a fetus and/or breastfed infant. Methods: Six women with PPD received 20 sessions of 10 Hz rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) over a 4 week period. Psychiatric rating scales (BDI, EPDS, STATI), cognitive assessments (MMSE, Trails B, List Generation) and breastfeeding practices were surveyed at baseline and post rTMS treatment. BDI and EPDS were obtained weekly, as well as 3 months and 6 months post study conclusion. Results: Average BDI, EPDS, and STAI scores declined over the 4-week duration of rTMS treatment. Of the six patients, four achieved remission as assessed by EPDS and one achieved remission and two responded as assessed by BDI. Mean BDI and EPDS scores at 3 and 6 months follow-up remained below levels at study entry. No evidence of cognitive changes or breastfeeding disruptions. Limitations: This was an exploratory study with small sample size with no sham control arm. Daily administration of rTMS provides potential for confounding of behavioral activation in the otherwise often isolative postpartum period. Conclusions: rTMS was safe and well tolerated among participants with evidence of sustained improvements in depression and anxiety scores. This study supports rTMS as a promising non-pharmacologic treatment modality for perinatal depression. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cox, E.

391,Change in maternal behavior during the baby's first year of life,"Assessed the influence of maternal attitudes, social support, and infant irritability on maternal behavior. Ss were 46 White and 2 Asian-American mothers and infants, previously reported by the 1st author (see record 1982-01036-001) and followed from pregnancy through the 1st yr of the child's life. Mothers completed a prenatal maternal questionnaire, a neonatal behavioral assessment scale, and a social support interview. Mother‚Äìinfant interaction was observed when the infant was 3 mo old, and each mother and infant were seen in the Ainsworth Strange Situation near the infant's 1st birthday. Maternal sensitivity was also assessed. Findings reveal that early maternal behavior did not predict later maternal behavior. Change in maternal behavior was associated with the mother's social support and with an interaction between her initial attitudes about responsiveness and her baby's irritability. Mothers with good social support were more sensitive toward their babies during reunion episodes of the Strange Situation than mothers with poor support. Mothers with unresponsive attitudes and irritable babies were the most insensitive. It was found that infant crying during separation was associated with early maternal unresponsiveness rather than with neonatal irritability. Implications of change in maternal behavior for the child's attachment security are discussed, including the possibility of altering attachment security by changing the conditions influencing maternal behavior.

Quality ratings for these same aspects of care were completed by trained data collectors. Parents gave high importance scores for all aspects of care, with higher scores for interactions, health, and safety related items than for other aspects of care. Parents gave their children's quality of care significantly higher ratings than did observers. When parents and observers rated the quality of aspects of care that were easy to monitor, differences in parent/observer quality scores were smaller than when they rated aspects that were more difficult to monitor. As parental values increased for an aspect of care, the difference between parent and observer quality scores also increased.

397,Improved circadian sleep-wake cycle in infants fed a day/night dissociated formula milk,"On the basis of the circadian nutritional variations present in breast milk, and of the implications for the sleep/wake cycle of the nutrients present in infant formula milks, we designed a formula milk nutritionally dissociated into a Day/Night composition. The goal was to improve the bottle-fed infant's sleep/wake circadian rhythm. A total of 21 infants aged 4-20 weeks with sleeping difficulties were enrolled in the three-week duration study. The sleep analysis was performed using an actimeter (Actiwatch) placed on an ankle of each infant to uninterruptedly record movements during the three weeks. The dissociated Day milk, designed to be administered from 06:00 to 18:00, contained low levels of tryptophan (1.5g/1OOg protein) and carbohydrates, high levels of proteins, and the nucleotides Cytidine 5‚Ä≤ monophosphate, Guanosine 5‚Ä≤ monophosphate and Inosine 5‚Ä≤ monophosphate. The dissociated Night milk, designed to be administered from 18.00 to 06.00, contained high levels of tryptophan (3.4g/1OOg protein) and carbohydrates, low levels of protein, and the nucleotides Adenosine 5‚Ä≤ monophosphate and Uridine 5‚Ä≤ monophosphate.

398,Predictors of maternal reactions to excessive crying of newborns. Findings from a prospective study in a naturalistic situation,"The prospective study examines which factors assessed in pregnancy predispose mothers to seeing their newborn crying more as a problem and to more mental health problems in response to excessive baby crying. Ss were 1,798 pregnant women (aged 19‚Äì43 yrs) who delivered a living singleton. Data were collected by means of a series of written questionnaires. The duration of the baby crying as well as the maternal reactions to the crying were assessed at a mean time of 1‚Äì2 mo following delivery. The maternal reactions were related to several variables assessed at the end of the 1st trimester of pregnancy. Four factors were found to be associated with the reactions of mothers to newborn crying. These are (1) the duration of the crying, (2) a first-born baby, (3) a relatively high maternal age, and (4) a relatively high score on ""neuroticism"" in mothers. It was concluded that it is possible to indicate to a certain degree which mothers of excessive crying babies are prone to report more impact of the crying or more mental health symptomatology. It might be worthwhile to offer those mothers some extra support in order to try to prevent the situation from becoming worse.

399,The development of auditory feedback monitoring: I. Delayed auditory feedback studies on infant cry,"Recorded vocal cry samples of 20 normal newborn infants under 2 test conditons: synchronous auditory feedback and a 200-msec delay in auditory feedback (DAF). Averages for cry duration, pause time, and maximum SPL were obtained for 16 of the 20 Ss. An analysis of variance showed significant effects for cry duration and amplitude (p < .05) but not for pause time. Ss tended to decrease the average duration of cry bursts by more than 100 msec. during the DAF test conditions. The results, while not conclusive, indicate that cry behavior may be under closed-loop auditory feedback control. It is suggested that the auditory monitoring of cry behavior be further investigated by the use of several delay times. If the magnitude and character of changes in crying behavior show consistent variation as a function of delay time, more persuasive evidence for an auditory feedback monitoring system will have been adduced.

Many preterm infants cared for in the NICU are exposed to parent‚Äìinfant separation, stress, and pain from medical care procedures. The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of early life stress on the trajectory of gut microbial structure. Stool samples from very preterm infants were collected weekly for 6¬†weeks. NICU stress exposure data were collected daily for 6¬†weeks. V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Zero-inflated beta regression model with random effects was used to assess the impact of stress on gut microbiome trajectories. Week of sampling was significant for Escherichia, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, Proteus, Streptococcus, Clostridium butyricum, and Clostridium perfringens. Antibiotic usage was significant for Proteus, Citrobacter, and C.¬†perfringens. Gender was significant for Proteus. Stress exposure occurring 1 and 2¬†weeks prior to sampling had a significant effect on Proteus and Veillonella. NICU stress exposure had a significant effect on Proteus and Veillonella. An overall dominance of Gammaproteobacteria was found. Findings suggest early life NICU stress may significantly influence the developing gut microbiome, which is important to NICU practice and future microbiome research. ¬© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","D‚ÄôAgata, A.

406,Recent advances in understanding and managing infantile colic,"A newborn brings joy to the family. Crying belongs to the spectrum of normal behaviour of young infants. However, although it occurs in about 20% of all infants, unsoothable and persistent crying in young infants distresses the family, although it is usually benign. The aetiology of infantile colic remains unknown, although an unbalanced gastro-intestinal microbiome, increased intestinal permeability, and chronic inflammation are involved, as well as behavioural factors, including over- and under-stimulation. It is a challenge for healthcare professionals to decide when organic disease needs to be excluded. Parental stress is a reason for babies to cry more, inducing a vicious cycle. Therefore, parental reassurance with explanatory guidance is the cornerstone of management. The placebo effect is estimated to be as high as 50%. If an intervention is felt to be necessary to offer further support to the baby and family, it is important to choose the options for which there is some efficacy without adverse effects. There is evidence that some specific probiotic strains such as Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 19378, especially in breastfed infants, are effective. However, there are also promising data for some synbiotics and/or killed or tyndallized bacteria, as well as substances decreasing intestinal permeability. Formula management with extensive and/or partial hydrolysates may also bring relief. But, above all, offering parental support remains imperative. ¬© 2018 Daelemans S et al.","Daelemans, S. and Peeters, L. and Hauser, B. and Vandenplas, Y.",0,325

This gap in research stands in contrast to the observable shift in parental roles and responsibilities in contemporary society. The goal of this study was to examine the roles of fathers, mothers, and children in the development of children's prosocial behavior. In the current study we examined the development of reciprocal relations between paternal and maternal behavior and child prosociality over 36 months. Three hundred eighty-one families were assessed when children were 18, 36, and 54 months of age. Fathers and mothers reported on their own warmth and negativity using standardized questionnaires. Child prosociality was measured using averaged parental reports. Actor-partner interdependence models revealed that paternal and maternal warmth predicted subsequent increases in child prosocial behavior, but child prosocial behavior did not predict subsequent parenting. Father and mother parenting practices were reciprocally interrelated. The results point to the important roles paternal and maternal warmth play in the development of children's prosocial behavior.","Daniel, E. and Madigan, S. and Jenkins, J.",0,328

Evaluation by the nurses of feeding, crying, motoric process, tremor and parental attitudes correlated well with observational data and with the results of a neurological examination. It was concluded that evaluation by the nurses using a questionnaire can be of value in neonatal units, especially when detailed observations or a systematic neurological examination are not feasible.","Dani√´ls, H. and Casaer, P. and Devlieger, H. and Eggermont, E.",0,329
413,A Case Study of the Environmental Experience of a Hospitalized Newborn Infant with Complex Congenital Heart Disease,"Background: Infants with complex congenital heart disease are at high risk for developmental delays. Although the etiology of these delays is multifactorial, the physical environment may be a contributory factor. Extensive studies have been conducted in neonatal intensive care units measuring environmental influences on development, resulting in policy and practice changes. Cardiothoracic intensive care units and cardiac step-down units are new environments in which newborns with heart disease receive care. No environmental studies have been conducted in units caring for newborn infants recovering from cardiac surgery. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the environmental experience of a newborn infant with heart disease after surgical intervention within the first month of life. Methods: Measurements of illumination, sound levels, and sleep were recorded on 1 infant for 2 consecutive postoperative days in the cardiothoracic intensive care unit and 2 consecutive days in the step-down unit. Results: Although average daily noise exposure remained below recommended guidelines on 3 of 4 days, the infant experienced intermittent periods of excessive noise (‚â•55 dBA) during 59 of 87 hours and 110 episodes of acute noise events greater than 70 dBA. Average daily light exposure was below the recommended guidelines. However, light levels were more than twice the recommended levels at multiple points daily. For each of the 4 observation days, the infant experienced 66 to 102 awakenings during sleep, and sleep durations were less than 30 minutes 90% of the time. Conclusions: This study provides the first report of potential environmental stressors in newborn infants cared for in cardiac specialty units. Excessive levels of light and noise as well as frequent interruptions for medical and nursing care may contribute to disorganized sleep and increased patient distress and may impact subsequent neurodevelopment. Studies are needed to identify potentially adverse aspects of the intensive caregiving environment for newborn infants who have undergone cardiac surgery. ¬© 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

414,Modifiable ‚Äúpredictors‚Äù of zinc status in toddlers,"Suboptimal zinc status is common in very young children and likely associated with increased risk of infection and detrimental effects on growth. No studies have determined potentially modifiable ‚Äúpredictors‚Äù of zinc status in toddlers from high-income countries. This cross-sectional analysis of 115 toddlers from the Baby-Led Introduction to SolidS (BLISS) study used weighed diet records (three non-consecutive days) to assess dietary intake, and a venous blood sample (trace-element free techniques) to assess plasma zinc, at 12 months of age. ‚ÄúPredictors‚Äù of plasma zinc were determined by univariate analysis and multiple regression. Mean (SD) plasma zinc was 9.7 (1.5) ¬µmol/L, 60% were below the IZiNCG reference limit of <9.9 ¬µmol/L. Median (25th, 75th percentiles) intake of zinc was 4.4 (3.7, 5.4) mg/day. Red meat intake (p = 0.004), consumption of zinc-fortified infant formula (3‚Äì6 mg zinc/100 g) (p = 0.026), and food fussiness (p = 0.028) were statistically significant ‚Äúpredictors‚Äù of plasma zinc at 12 months. Although higher intakes of red meat, and consumption of infant formula, are potentially achievable, it is important to consider possible barriers, particularly impact on breastfeeding, cost, and the challenges of behavior modification. Of interest is the association with food fussiness‚Äîfurther research should investigate the direction of this association. ¬© 2018 by the authors.

415,Feeding Practices and Parenting: A Pathway to Child Health and Family Happiness,"Feeding and parenting are inextricably linked. The complex bidirectional interactions between parent feeding practices and child eating behaviour shape the early feeding environment which in turn interacts with genetic predispositions to lay the foundation for life-long eating habits and health outcomes. Parent feeding and child (and parent) eating are central to the fabric of family life and are strongly rooted in culture and tradition. Yet, many parents experience stress and anxiety related to this ubiquitous parenting task and perceive their child as a ""fussy eater"" or a ""difficult feeder."" Parents commonly misinterpret heritable and developmentally ""normal"" child eating behaviour, such as food refusal, as cause for concern. In an effort to get their child to ""eat well"" they respond with coercive feeding practices, such as pressure, reward and restriction. Emotional feeding that uses food to comfort, distract, calm or shape behaviour is also common. Although well intentioned, these non-responsive, parent- rather than child-centred feeding practices are ineffective, even counterproductive. They teach children to eat for reasons unrelated to appetite and, hence, more than they need and fail to support development of healthy food preferences and appetite regulation. Early feeding interventions are needed that assist parents to understand normal child eating behaviour and promote responsive feeding practices and effective food parenting. The aim of this chapter is to review (1) ""normal"" eating behaviour of young children, (2) the range of feeding practices and strategies that parents use to respond to and try to shape these behaviours, (3) evidence for approaches to feeding young children that have potential to reduce conflict related to child feeding and promote life-long healthy eating patterns that are a key determinant of long-term health and well-being and (4) to provide an overview of an early feeding intervention, NOURISH, which demonstrated a positive impact on maternal feeding practices and potentially reduced parent anxiety and stress related to feeding. ¬© 2019 S.

416,Child eating behavior outcomes of an early feeding intervention to reduce risk indicators for child obesity: The NOURISH RCT,"Objective The objective was to describe parent-reported child eating behavior and maternal parenting impact outcomes of an infant feeding intervention to reduce child obesity risk. Methods An assessor masked Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) with concealed allocation of individual mother-infant dyads. The NOURISH RCT enrolled 698 first-time mothers (mean age 30.1 years, SD = 5.3) with healthy term infants (51% female) aged 4.3 months (SD = 1.0) at baseline. Outcomes were assessed 6 months post-intervention when the children were 2 years old. Mothers reported on child eating behaviors using the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ), food preferences, and dietary intake using a 24-hour telephone recall. Parenting was assessed using five scales validated for use in Australia. Results Intervention effects were evident on the CEBQ overall (MANOVA P = 0.002) and 4/8 subscales: child satiety responsiveness (P = 0.03), fussiness (P = 0.01), emotional overeating (P < 0.01), and food responsiveness (P = 0.06). Intervention children ""liked"" more fruits (P < 0.01) and fewer non-core foods and beverages (P = 0.06, 0.03). The intervention mothers reported greater ""autonomy encouragement"" (P = 0.002).

417,Evaluation of an intervention to promote protective infant feeding practices to prevent childhood obesity: Outcomes of the NOURISH RCT at 14 months of age and 6 months post the first of two intervention modules,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a universal obesity prevention intervention, which commenced at infant age 4-6 months, using outcome data assessed 6 months after completion of the first of two intervention modules and 9 months from baseline. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial of a community-based early feeding intervention. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Six hundred and ninety-eight first-time mothers (mean age 30 ¬± 5 years) with healthy term infants (51% male) aged 4.3 ¬± 1.0 months at baseline, Mothers and infants were randomly allocated to self-directed access to usual care or to attend two group education modules, each delivered over 3 months, that provided anticipatory guidance on early feeding practices. Outcome data reported here were assessed at infant age 13.7 ¬± 1 .3 months. Anthropornetrics were expressed as z-scores (WHO reference), Rapid weight gain was defined as change in weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) of > + 0.67. Maternal feeding practices were assessed via self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: There were no differences according to group allocation on key maternal and infant characteristics, At follow-up (n = 598 (86%)), the control group infants had higher BMI-for-age z-score (BMIZ) (0.42 ¬± 0,85 vs 0.23 ¬± 0.93, P = 0.009) and were more likely to show rapid weight gain from baseline to follow-up (odds ratio (OR) 1.5, confidence interval (Cl) 95% = 1.1-2.1, P=0.014). Mothers in the control group were more likely to report using non-responsive feeding practices that fail to respond to infant satiety cues such as encouraging eating by using food as a reward (15% vs 4%, P=0.0O1) or using games (67% vs 29%, P.<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide early evidence that anticipatory guidance targeting the 'when, what and how' of solid feeding can be effective in changing maternal feeding practices and, at least in the short term, reducing anthropometric indicators of childhood obesity risk. Analyses of outcomes at later ages are required to determine if these promising effects can be sustained. ¬© 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.","Daniels, L. A. and Mallan, K.

In developed countries many non-pharmacological interventions are used for neonatal pain reduction. Breast feeding has been proved to be an effective analgesic during mild to moderate painful procedures in neonates. METHODS: The study, randomized controlled trial was conducted in CMH, Quetta. The study period extended from June to November 2015. Neonates included in the experimental group were breastfeed during BCG vaccination and neonates in the control group were provided with routine care. Duration of cry with needle insertion was recorded with a digital stopwatch till the baby is silent for more than 5 seconds. RESULTS: The mean crying duration in experimental group was significantly less than control group. In experimental group mean crying duration was 16.48s (12.76) whereas in control group mean crying duration was 34.93 s(45.26). Statistically significant difference was observed between the mean crying times of the two groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mean duration of crying with breastfeeding is shorter than without breast feeding during BCG immunization.

429,Extended Release Liposomal Bupivacaine Injection (Exparel) for Early Postoperative Pain Control Following Palatoplasty,"INTRODUCTION: Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is a long-acting local anesthetic reported to decrease postoperative pain in adults. The authors demonstrate the safe use of LB in pediatric patients with improved pain control following palatoplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective patient series of all single-surgeon palatoplasty patients treated at a tertiary craniofacial center from August 2014 to December 2015 were included. All patients received 1.3% LB intraoperatively as greater palatal nerve and surgical field blocks in 2-flap V-Y pushback palatoplasty. Postoperative oral intake, opioids administered, duration of hospitalization, and FLACC (face, legs, activity, cry, consolability) pain scores were measured. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (16 males and 11 females, average age of 10.8 months, weight 8.8‚Ääkg) received 2.9‚Ää¬±‚Ää0.9‚ÄämL (2.6‚Ää¬±‚Ää1.9‚Äämg/kg) 1.3% LB. Average FLACC scores were 2.4‚Ää¬±‚Ää2.2/10 in the postanesthesia care unit and 3.8‚Ää¬±‚Ää1.8/10 while inpatients. Oral intake was first tolerated 10.3‚Ää¬±‚Ää11.5‚Äähours postoperatively and tolerated 496.4‚Ää¬±‚Ää354.2 mL orally in the first 24‚Äähours postoperatively. Patients received 8.5‚Ää¬±‚Ää8.4‚Äämg hydrocodone equivalents (0.46‚Ää¬±‚Ää0.45‚Äämg/kg per d hydrocodone equivalents) and were discharged 2.1‚Ää¬±‚Ää1.3 days postoperatively. Opioid-related adverse events included emesis in 7.4% and pruritis in 3.7% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The LB may be used safely in pediatric patients. Intraoperative injection of LB during palatoplasty can yield low postoperative opioid use and an early and adequate volume of oral intake over an average hospital stay. Further cost-efficacy studies of LB are needed to assess its value in pediatric plastic surgery.","Day, K. M. and Nair, N. M. and Sargent, L. A.",0,343

434,Functioning within a relationship: Mother-infant synchrony and infant sleep,"The aim of this study was to investigate the coupling of the biological system of infant sleep and the social system of mother-infant synchrony. Before birth and shortly after birth the systems appear to be connected, but it is unclear whether this remains the case over time. This study therefore examined whether infant sleep measured at 6 weeks and 5 months could predict mother-infant gaze synchrony after a social challenge at 5 months (N=84). Infant sleep was measured in terms of sleep bout duration, which normally increases during this period. Gaze was defined in terms of looking at each other's head simultaneously, known as gaze synchrony, or looking elsewhere. Results showed that infant sleep could predict the temporal dynamics of the mother-infant interaction in terms of flexibility of gaze pattern shifts. The larger the increase in sleep bout duration over age, the more flexible the interaction appeared to be. Maternal Age, type of feeding and change of feeding appeared to function as confounding variables in this relation. Infant sleep could not predict percentage of synchrony (central tendency measure) or the average sequence length of gaze patterns (temporal dynamic measure). ¬© 2011 Elsevier Inc.","De Graag, J.

435,Maternal responses to the sexual abuse of their children,"To define categories of maternal response and determine their relationship to variable features of the abuse situation, a questionnaire was administered to mothers of 103 children returning for a routine 2- to 3-week follow-up of a sexual abuse episode. Three categories of response were identified: nonsupportive, supportive without emotional changes, and supportive with emotional changes. Nonsupportive mothers (n = 32) believed that the abuse complaint was a lie, a misunderstanding, or the child's fault. They rarely considered pressing charges or requested counseling. Supportive mothers (n = 71) believed that the child was telling the truth and that the assailant was primarily responsible. Anger, fear, anxiety, and guilt were commonly expressed. Thirty-nine of the supportive mothers reported behavior or mood changes including sleep, appetite, or somatic complaints and recurrent crying. Most were pressing charges (79%) and sought counseling for themselves (74%) and their children (82%). The 32 supportive mothers without behavior or mood changes also frequently pressed charges (88%) but sought counseling for themselves (6%) and the children (53%) less often (P less than .001). Individual personality and coping mechanisms may determine the maternal response. Maternal emotional responses do not appear to be related to variable features of the abuse situation but are significantly related to the approach to subsequent psychologic and legal issues.","De Jong, A.

Data from the Hospital Information System for 2013 were compiled according to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision. Hospitalization rates were estimated according to region, sex, age and disease chapter, taking into account the 2012 population as a reference, as well the percentage of highly complex procedures and mortality rates. Public hospitals treated 190,000 inpatients in 2013. The rate was highest among the population in the South of Brazil, those who were male and children under the age of one. The rate was lowest among the population in the North, females and children aged between 10 and 14years. The mean duration of hospitalization was six days, the percentage of highly complex procedures was 13.5% and the mortality rate was 1.3%. The three most common causes for hospitalizations were diseases of the respiratory system, neoplasms and diseases of the nervous system. The incidence of complex chronic conditions is 331 inwards per 100,000 children and adolescents in Brazil, with an estimate of 240,000 children and adolescents hospitalized.

451,"Mothers' attachment to infants: Relations with infant temperament, stress, and responsive maternal behavior","38 mothers completed attachment, stress, and infant temperament questionnaires, and were observed interacting with their infants, when the infants were 6 wks and 9 mo old. Maternal feelings of attachment were unrelated to their responsive behaviors. More severely stressed mothers felt less attached at 6 wks, but stress did not affect maternal behaviors. Fussy babies had less attached mothers: the effect of temperament on responsive behavior was more complex. Mothers of fussier babies were less responsive. Mothers also reported feeling more attached to boys. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","Denham, Susanne A. and Moser, Margo H.",0,357
453,Associations of Infant Sleep Duration with Body Composition and Cardiovascular Health to Mid-Adolescence: The PEAS Kids Growth Study,"Short sleep duration in childhood has often been linked with obesity in later childhood or adolescence. However, whether infant sleep duration affects body composition trajectories and cardiovascular health through to mid-adolescence remains unknown. Methods: Participants were 336 adolescents from a community-based prospective birth cohort in Melbourne, Australia. Mothers completed 24-hour time diaries, including infant sleep in 5-minute intervals at ages 2, 4, and 12 months. BMI and body composition outcomes were measured 6-monthly between 4 and 6.5 years and at 10 and 14 years. Cardiovascular outcomes at 14 years comprised blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, retinal arteriole-to-venule ratio, and carotid intima-media thickness. We used multivariable linear regression and multinomial logistic regression analyses adjusted for sex, age, BMI at birth, gestational age, ethnicity, maternal education, maternal BMI, and neighborhood socioeconomic position. Results: At 2 months, infants slept on average 14.1 hours [standard deviation (SD) 1.9], decreasing to 13.4 hours (SD 2.0) by 12 months. We observed no associations between the different sleep duration time points in infancy and later BMI or body composition. Moreover, a shorter sleep duration did not increase the odds of being on a high body composition trajectory compared with longer sleep (e.g., odds ratio per hour of sleep at 4 months is 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.65-1.11). Infant sleep duration was also not associated with cardiovascular function or large or small artery structure at 14 years of age. Conclusions: We found no evidence that sleep duration very early in life affects adolescent body composition or cardiovascular health. ¬© Copyright 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","Derks, I.

455,Clinician Satisfaction and Self-Efficacy With CenteringParenting Group Well-Child Care Model: A Pilot Study,"Introduction: Group-based models for well-child care have been shown to positively affect patient experience. One promising group well-child care model is CenteringParenting. However, clinician self-efficacy with delivery of the model is unknown and clinician satisfaction with the model has been understudied. Objectives: To investigate sense of self-efficacy, degree of satisfaction, and comfort with trauma-informed care (TIC) among diverse clinical providers implementing the CenteringParenting curriculum. We also examined the relationship between self-efficacy, satisfaction, and comfort with TIC, and delivery of the model. Methods: Electronic surveys were sent to CenteringParenting providers (N = 98) from 49 clinics. Providers (N = 41) from 24 clinical sites completed the survey, corresponding to a 42% individual and 49% site response rate. Surveys explored provider: satisfaction with the curriculum, perceived self-efficacy, and perspective on competency with TIC. Results: Providers indicated that the CenteringParenting model achieves each of its four objectives (means ranged from 4.10 to 4.52 for each objective, with 5 being the highest possible response). Providers rated their level of satisfaction (scale of 1 [unsatisfied] to 5 [very satisfied]) with their ability to address patient concerns higher with CenteringParenting in the group care setting (mean = 4.10) than in the individual care setting (mean = 3.55). Respondents demonstrated a high mean average Self-Efficacy in Group Care score of 93.63 (out of 110). Unadjusted logistical regression analyses demonstrated that higher provider Self-Efficacy in Group Care score (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08) and higher comfort with TIC (OR = 22.16) is associated with curriculum content being discussed with a facilitative approach. Conclusions: Providers from diverse clinical sites report high satisfaction with and self-efficacy in implementing the CenteringParenting model. ¬© The Author(s) 2019.","Desai, S. and Chen, F. and Boynton-Jarrett, R.",0,359
456,"Colic and fussing in infancy, and sensory processing at 3 to 8 years of age","The purpose of this follow-up study was to examine whether a group of 28 clinic-referred infants with colic, excessive crying, or both at 4 to 12 weeks demonstrated sensory processing, coping, and behavioral/attention regulation difficulties at 3 to 8 years of age. Seventy-five percent of the sample demonstrated atypical behavioral responses to sensory experiences. Hours of fussing during infancy significantly correlated with inattention, emotional reactivity, touch processing, environmental coping, and externalizing behavior at 3 to 8 years, but not hours of crying. The most striking result was that children with more hours of early fussing showed less efficient sensory processing, poorer coping with the environment, and more attention/hyperactivity problems compared to those with less hours of fussing. Results suggest that hours of fussing rather than crying could be an early marker for infants at risk. ¬© 2004 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.","Desantis, A. and Coster, W. and Bigsby, R. and Lester, B.",0,360
457,"Exploring an integrative model of infant behavior: What is the relationship among temperament, sensory processing, and neurobehavioral measures?","Traditionally, developmental psychology, occupational/physical therapy, and behavioral pediatrics view similar infant behaviors from temperament, sensory processing, or neurobehavioral theoretical perspectives. This study examined the relations between similar and unique summary scores of three infant assessments (Early Infancy Temperament Questionnaire - EITQ, the Infant Sensory Profile - ISP, and the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale - NNNS) in a healthy sample of 100, one-month-old infants. A Principal Components Analysis of selected subscale scores derived from the three assessments suggested a three-factor model. Temperament and sensory summary scores had the strongest relations on two factors: Sensory-Affective Reactivity and Engagement. A third factor had strong relations between state regulation and motor competence. This new integrative model also validates an existing model and expands explanation of infant behavior across disciplines and methods which have significant implications for assessment, intervention, and management practices. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Inc.","DeSantis, A. and Harkins, D. and Tronick, E. and Kaplan, E. and Beeghly, M.",0,361

A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out at the neonatal intensive care unit at the King Edward Memorial Hospital. Sixty healthy preterm infants of gestation age 28-37 weeks and postnatal age 2-28 days were randomized to receive 2 ml of one of three solutions (sterile water, 10 per cent wt/vol. glucose and 25 per cent wt/vol. glucose) in the mouth 2 min before venipuncture. There was a significant reduction in duration of first cry in the babies given 25 per cent glucose compared with controls and those given 10 per cent glucose. There was no significant effect on heart rate, respiratory rate or oxygen saturation. It is concluded that concentrated glucose solution seems to reduce pain and may be a useful and safe analgesic for minor procedures in neonates.","Deshmukh, L. S. and Udani, R. H.",0,362
460,A reassessment of the role of pitch and duration in adults' responses to infant crying,"Researchers have identified pitch and duration as components of infants' cries that mediate adults' reactions. The current study used a novel method of cry manipulation to resolve a methodological confounding of pitch with other variables. The stimuli consisted of 25 different 15-sec cry sounds. These were created by computer manipulation of the pitch and durational features of sections of a single cry bout of a 3-mo-old female infant. The reactions of 19 female undergraduates (aged 18‚Äì21 yrs) were assessed using a Semantic Differential scale. After each cry sound, the S rated that cry along 11 7-point scales. A 5 (pitch)‚ÄÇ√ó‚ÄÇ5 (duration) repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for each of the response and descriptive scales. The results demonstrate that differences in pitch mediate adults' perceptions.

461,"Risk factors for suboptimal infant breastfeeding behavior, delayed onset of lactation, and excess neonatal weight loss","Objective. Some mothers have difficulty initiating lactation even when highly motivated to breastfeed. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for suboptimal infant breastfeeding behavior (SIBB), delayed onset of lactation, and excess neonatal weight loss among mother-infant pairs in a population with high educational levels and motivation to breastfeed. Methods. All mothers residing in Davis, California, who gave birth to a healthy, single, term infant at 1 of 5 area hospitals during the 10-month recruitment period in 1999 were invited to participate if they were willing to attempt to breastfeed exclusively for at least 1 month. Lactation guidance was provided and data were collected in the hospital (day 0) and on days 3, 5, 7, and 14. Infant breastfeeding behavior was evaluated by trained lactation consultants using the Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool. Onset of lactation was defined based on maternal report of changes in breast fullness. Infant weight loss was considered excessive if it was 210% of birth weight by day 3. Results. Of the 328 eligible mothers, 280 (85%) participated in the study. The prevalence of SIBB was 49% on day 0, 22% on day 3, and 14% on day 7. SIBB was significantly associated with primiparity (days 0 and 3), cesarean section (in multiparas, day 0), flat or inverted nipples, infant status at birth (days 0 and 3), use of nonbreast milk fluids in the first 48 hours (days 3 and 7), pacifier use (day 3), stage II labor &gt","Dewey, K.

METHODS: Infants were recruited at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary Neonatal Unit, Edinburgh, UK. Eyes were examined by WFDRI and BIO with eyelid speculum by two experienced paediatric ophthalmologists in random order. A pain score (Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP)) for WFDRI and BIO was generated. RESULTS: A total of 76 infants were recruited. The (mean, SD) PIPP score for WFDRI was 15.0, 2.1 and for BIO was 15.2, 2.4 (paired t test p=0.47). The authors observed that infants started crying with corresponding physiological changes as soon as the eyelid speculum was inserted and crying stopped on speculum removal. CONCLUSION: WFDRI and BIO with eyelid speculum are similarly painful for infants. The authors speculate that the eyelid speculum rather than the examination method may contribute most to the pain experienced.","Dhaliwal, C.

465,Association of a Postnatal Parent Education Program for Abusive Head Trauma With Subsequent Pediatric Abusive Head Trauma Hospitalization Rates,"IMPORTANCE: Studies suggest that a postnatal parental intervention may reduce the incidence of abusive head trauma (AHT) of infants and young children. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of statewide universal AHT education for parents on AHT hospitalization rates in Pennsylvania and on parents' self-reported knowledge gains and parenting behaviors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Changes in AHT hospitalization rates in Pennsylvania before and during the intervention were compared with those in 5 other states lacking universal parental AHT education during the same period. Data were collected from maternity units and birthing centers throughout Pennsylvania from the parents of 1‚ÄØ593‚ÄØ834 infants born on these units from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2013. Parental behavior and knowledge were assessed through immediate (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ16‚ÄØ111) and 7-month postintervention (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ146) parent surveys in a per protocol analysis of evaluable parents. INTERVENTIONS: Parents read a brochure, viewed an 8-minute video about infant crying and AHT, asked questions of the nurse, and signed a commitment statement affirming their participation. Educational posters were displayed on each unit. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in AHT hospitalization rates before and during the intervention in Pennsylvania and 5 other states.

467,New strategies for the treatment of colic: Modifying the parent/infant interaction,"Introduction: The purpose of this study was to validate the effectiveness of behavior modification in treating colicky infants. Colic was defined as a self-limiting condition in infants less than 4 months of age with a complex of physical behaviors and inconsolable crying (>2 hours a day for 3 days), It was hypothesized that when parents are given specific instructions about how to respond quickly and appropriately to their infants cues (modification of the parent/infant interaction), the amount of crying by the infant decreases. Method: A quasi-experimental design with an untreated control group and a pretest and posttest was used for the study. Twenty-three infants were randomly assigned to intervention, nonintervention, and control groups. Crying diaries kept by the parents were used obtain quantitative measurements of crying before and after intervention. The Nursing Child Assessment Feeding Scale (NCAFS) was used to measure parent/infant interaction. Results: Crying was significantly reduced from 3.79 hours per day to 1.12 hours per day (F=46.00, df= 2, P < .05) among infants whose parents received interventions of individualized counseling and education. Caregivers of colicky infants in the intervention group scored lower on the NCAFS (F=5.59, df= 2, P < .05).

470,Safety monitoring of a new pentavalent vaccine in the expanded programme on immunisation in Ghana,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Safety monitoring of vaccines used in expanded programmes on immunisation is important in all countries, including those with limited resources. As the rates of target diseases decrease, parents become less accepting of even minor common adverse events. Identification, detection, prevention and appropriate communication of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) are therefore essential to preserve the integrity of immunisation programmes and protect public health. The objective of this study was to document the occurrence of common minor AEFI associated with a newly introduced pentavalent vaccine for routine immunisation in Ghana's expanded programme on immunisation. METHODS: A prospective descriptive study on AEFI associated with the administration of a pentavalent diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B (DTP-hepatitis B vaccine/Hib vaccine) vaccine that is part of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation was carried out in four locations in Accra, Ghana. These locations were the nation's premier teaching hospital (the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital) two urban polyclinics (the Mamprobi and Ussher Town polyclinics) and a community immunisation centre (the Zongo Junction Immunisation Centre).A total of 406 infants were recruited for the study. Upon receipt of signed informed consent from the parents/guardians of the infants, the parents/guardians were supplied with a pink card that functioned as a pseudo-diary for recording AEFI that occurred at home and for measuring and noting the sizes of any injection-site swellings that might occur. It also enabled each participant to obtain free medical care at the Department of Child Health, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital for the duration of the study (from September 2003 to December 2004) and until the child was 12 months old. Information about the occurrence of AEFI was actively solicited during each visit for immunisation and also at a visit 4 weeks after administration of the last dose of pentavalent vaccine, when participants were asked to report to the respective immunisation centres for the specific purpose of reporting any AEFI which might have occurred in the intervening period. These AEFI were analysed separately from those reported to the dedicated hospital unit at the Department of Child Health, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, since the AEFI reported to that unit were all verified and recorded by trained physicians. RESULTS: Of the 406 infants, 368 completed the study, whereas 38 defaulted or were lost to follow-up. There were 104 attendances to report cases of suspected AEFI requiring physician attention at the Department of Child Health, Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital.

474,Can newborns discriminate between their own cry and the cry of another newborn infant?,"Two experiments were conducted to test whether newborns could discriminate between their own cry and the cry of another newborn infant. Facial behavior and nonnutritive sucking rate were adopted as dependent measures. In Experiment 1, 20 newborns in an awake state were presented with either their own cry or the cry of another infant. In the latter condition, newborns showed the facial expression of distress more frequently and for a longer duration. In addition, the rate of sucking decreased significantly between the pretest phase and the 1st min of presentation of another infant's cry. Newborns' responses, although delayed and less intense, showed a similar trend in Experiment 2, during which 20 newborns in a sleep state were tested with the same procedure. These results indicate the newborns' capability to discriminate between the 2 cry stimuli and show the effectiveness of a newborn cry in inducing distress signals in another newborn infant.

Heart rate and skin conductance were recorded continuously while each S viewed a sequence of 6 identical episodes of one expression followed by 6 episodes of the other expression. Both cardiac and skin conductance responses to the smile expression decreased following repeated presentations of the cry stimulus. Cardiac deceleration to the cry was prolonged following the viewing of the smiling infant. Ss' perception of their own infants' temperament assessed by the Infant Temperament Questionnaire was systematically related to maternal heart rate response. Ss who described their infants as more difficult were physiologically less sensitive to changes in infant expressions.

This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Pedilact on the treatment of infantile colic. Materials and Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, 84 infant younger than 3 months with infantile colic were divided in two groups of 42 cases each- probiotic and standard treatment. This study was done in Arak city, Iran between 2013 and 2016. The population of the study consisted of breastfed infants and formula-fed infants younger than 3 months (less than 13 weeks) who referred to Amir Kabir Hospital and pediatric clinics presenting crying and restlessness symptoms consistent with the modified Wessel criteria. In the treatment group, in addition to the main treatment, five drops of Pedilact (Iran) was daily administered for 28 days. In both groups, the main treatment was instructed to the parents and they were advised to do the following techniques to pacify the infant: making relaxing sounds or vocals, applying peaceful and rhythmic rocking motion, walking, and using mild tremor-like movements. Results: In Pedilact and control groups, 54.75% and 28.57% of the cases were male, respectively. 23 infants (75.61%) in the Pedilact group and 33 infants (82.5%) in the control group were breastfed infants. The mean age of infants in Pedilact and control groups were 6.64 + 2.90 and 6.69 + 5.97, respectively. There was no significant difference between the Pedilact and control groups in terms of mean duration of crying time during a day (P= 0.075), and the number of crying attacks per day (P= 0.127), there was a significant decrease in both variables over time, but the mean for hours of sleep in the group receiving the standard treatment was significantly higher than that of the group receiving Pedilact (P= 0.001).

478,Infant and maternal predictors of early life feeding decisions. The timing of solid food introduction,"There is limited research on the maternal and infant characteristics associated with the timing of solid food introduction. The current study examined how maternal feeding style and infant temperament independently and interactively predicted the age at which infants were introduced to solid food. Data from 115 predominately white, middle-class mothers were collected when infants were 4 and 6 months of age. The timing of solid food introduction was positively correlated with mothers' age, education, breastfeeding at 4 months, self-reported responsiveness to infants' hunger and satiety cues, and negatively correlated with mothers' pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), beliefs about feeding infants solid food prior to 6 months of age, and infants' temperamental motor reactivity. When controlling for maternal age, education, pre-pregnancy BMI, and milk feeding method at 4 months, the timing of solid food introduction was negatively predicted by mothers' beliefs about feeding solid food prior to 6 months of age. Exploratory interaction analyses suggested that infant temperament marginally moderated maternal feeding style in predicting the timing of solid food introduction. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Doub, A.

479,Making Sense of Studies That Claim Benefits of Frenotomy in the Absence of Classic Tongue-Tie,"By performing an in-depth analysis of one high profile example, this article aims to help breastfeeding support professionals understand the methodological flaws that characterize recent studies claiming to show the efficacy of frenotomy for the diagnoses of posterior tongue-tie and upper lip-tie. The example study does not address definitional confusion or control for the effects of the passage of time. It does not consider the effects of caring attention, validation, and lactation consultant support. It also does not consider the extensive research over the past three decades that has established that reflux in the first 6 months of life is benign, even though increased reflux frequency may correlate with unsettled infant behavior. The study authors relied on the hypothesis that reflux is caused by excessive air swallowing in infants with poor latch due to posterior tongue-tie and upper lip-tie, which lacks credible physiological mechanisms or supporting evidence. The authors' claim that conducting a randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of frenotomy would be unethical contradicts the basic principles of good science. This article argues that our breastfeeding women and their babies deserve the most rigorous scientific methods available, and acknowledgment of the biases inherent in less rigorous research, if we are to make appropriate decisions concerning intervention with frenotomy and to prevent unnecessary oral surgery. ¬© International Lactation Consultant Association.","Douglas, P.",0,376
480,"Gestalt Breastfeeding: Helping Mothers and Infants Optimize Positional Stability and Intraoral Breast Tissue Volume for Effective, Pain-Free Milk Transfer","In the past decade, biological nurturing and activation of maternal and infant instincts after birth have constituted a major advance in clinical breastfeeding support. Yet, physiologic breastfeeding initiation is not enough to ensure ongoing pain-free and effective breastfeeding for many pairs. Current interventions, including ""hands-off"" mammalian approaches, do not improve breastfeeding outcomes, including in randomized controlled trials. Back-arching, difficulty latching or staying on the breast, and fussing at the breast are common signs of infant positional instability during breastfeeding. These cues are, however, often misdiagnosed as signs of medical conditions or oral connective tissue abnormalities, and underlying positional instability is not addressed. New clinical approaches are urgently required. This article offers a clinical approach to fit and hold (or latch and positioning) - gestalt breastfeeding, which aims to optimize positional stability and intraoral breast tissue volumes for pain-free effective breastfeeding. The word gestalt (pronounced ""ger-shtolt"") means a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. Gestalt breastfeeding builds on the theoretical foundations of complexity science, physiologic breastfeeding initiation, and new understandings of the biomechanics of infant suck elucidated in ultrasound studies. It also integrates simple psychological strategies from applied functional contextualism, popularly known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, empowering women to attend mindfully to breast sensations and their infant's cues. Gestalt breastfeeding can be reproduced for research purposes, including in comparison studies with oral surgery, and has the potential to improve breastfeeding outcomes. ¬© International Lactation Consultant Association.","Douglas, P. and Keogh, R.",0,377
481,Diagnosing gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or lactose intolerance in babies who cry alot in the first few months overlooks feeding problems,"This paper explores two areas in which the translation of research into practice may be improved in the management of cry-fuss behaviours in the first few months of life. Firstly, babies who cry excessively are often prescribed proton pump inhibitors, despite evidence that gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is very rarely a cause. The inaccuracy of commonly used explanatory mechanisms, the side-effects of acid-suppressive medications, and the failure to identify treatable problems, including feeding difficulty when the diagnosis of 'reflux' is applied, are discussed. Secondly, crying breastfed babies are still prescribed lactase or lactose-free formula, despite evidence that the problem of functional lactose overload is one of breastfeeding management. The mechanisms and management of functional lactose overload are discussed. These two problems of research translation need to be addressed because failure to identify and manage other causes of cry-fuss problems, including feeding difficulty, may have adverse outcomes for a small but significant minority of families. ¬© 2013 The Author.

482,A neurobiological model for cry-fuss problems in the first three to four months of life,"Although problem crying in the first three to four months of life is usually self-limiting, it is not a trivial condition. Early intervention is important, yet families receive conflicting advice from health professionals. The past decade has seen significant advances in neuroscience, lactation science, and developmental psychology, including new insights into the significance of developmentally sensitive windows. We propose a neurobiological model to explain the mechanisms of cry-fuss problems in the first months of life, and the mechanisms which underlie effective intervention, with a view to facilitating research collaboration and consistency of advice across health disciplines. We hypothesise that crying in the first three to four neurodevelopmentally sensitive months signals activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and adrenergic neuronal circuitry in response to perceptions of discomfort or threat. Susceptible infants may be conditioned by early stress, for example, by unidentified feeding difficulties, into a sensitised stress response, which usually settles at three to four months of age with neurodevelopmental maturity. Bouts of prolonged and unsoothable crying result from positive feedback loops in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and adrenergic systems. Importantly, epigenetic modulation of the infant's limbic neuronal circuitry may explain correlations between regulatory problems in the first months of life, and behavioural problems including feeding problems in later childhood. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Douglas, P.

The research used a purposive selection strategy and thematic analysis of key informant interviews of 24 health professionals from 11 disciplines. Informants were selected for extensive experience in the management of unsettled babies and their families.Participants corroborated existing evidence that post-birth care in Australia is fragmented. All held the view that, first, early primary care intervention for unsettled infants and their families, and second, improved cross-professional communication, are vital if the burden of this problem to the infant, family and health system are to be minimised. There was consensus, third, that significant gaps exist in health professionals' knowledge base and management behaviours.The development of education resources, best practice guidelines, shared assessment frameworks for primary care practitioners and strategies for improved cross-professional communication are necessary to improve the health outcomes and decrease the burden of this common yet complex post-birth problem. ¬© 2012 La Trobe University.","Douglas, P.

484,Preliminary evaluation of a primary care intervention for cry-fuss behaviours in the first 3-4 months of life ('The Possums Approach'): Effects on cry-fuss behaviours and maternal mood,"Problem crying in the first few months of life is both common and complex, arising out of multiple interacting and co-evolving factors. Parents whose babies cry and fuss a lot receive conflicting advice as they seek help from multiple health providers and emergency departments, and may be admitted into tertiary residential services. Conflicting advice is costly, and arises out of discipline-specific interpretations of evidence. An integrated, interdisciplinary primary care intervention ('The Possums Approach') for cry-fuss problems in the first months of life was developed from available peer-reviewed evidence. This study reports on preliminary evaluation of delivery of the intervention. A total of 20 mothers who had crying babies under 16 weeks of age (average age 6.15 weeks) completed questionnaires, including the Crying Patterns Questionnaire and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, before and 3-4 weeks after their first consultation with trained primary care practitioners. Preliminary evaluation is promising. The Crying Patterns Questionnaire showed a significant decrease in crying and fussing duration, by 1h in the evening (P‚â§0.001) and 30min at night (P‚â§0.009). The median total amount of crying and fussing in a 24-h period was reduced from 6.12 to 3h. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale showed a significant improvement in depressive symptoms, with the median score decreasing from 11 to 6 (P‚â§0.005). These findings are corroborated by an analysis of results for the subset of 16 participants whose babies were under 12 weeks of age (average age 4.71 weeks). These preliminary results demonstrate significantly decreased infant crying in the evening and during the night and improved maternal mood, validating an innovative interdisciplinary clinical intervention for cry-fuss problems in the first few months of life. This intervention, delivered by trained health professionals, has the potential to mitigate the costly problem of health professionals giving discipline-specific and conflicting advice post-birth. ¬© La Trobe University 2015","Douglas, P.

485,Protocol for a study of the psychosocial determinants of health in early childhood among children with cystic fibrosis,"Aims: To investigate the causal associations between family relationships, family functioning, social circumstances and health outcomes in young children with cystic fibrosis. Background: The anticipated health gains for patients with cystic fibrosis, promised by early diagnosis through newborn screening, have yet to be fully realized, despite advances in cystic fibrosis health care with aggressive management in multidisciplinary clinics and the development of specific medications. Adverse psychosocial functioning may underpin the current lack of progress as it is well recognized that compromised early parent-child attachment relationship experiences and adverse social circumstances have negative impacts on lifelong health status and health resource use, even in healthy children. Design: A cross-sectional (initial) and longitudinal (progressive), multicentre study of children aged 3 months-6 years with cystic fibrosis, who have been diagnosed by newborn screening.

Measures included the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A sub-group of ""neurotic"" mothers experienced higher levels of negative emotional arousal in response to crying and were more likely to adopt a passive response strategy to infant crying and report generally higher levels of present state anxiety. However, when neurotic mothers received the tape and booklet providing cry information, they reported lower levels of negative affect and adopted a generally more active response to infant crying.

488,Greek fathers' participation in labour and care of the infant,"Greek fathers' (n = 157) reactions to their presence at the delivery, their expectations about the baby and their childcare practices were explored at the 4th-6th week postpartum. Only 10% of the sample attended the delivery. Their non-attendance was attributed, by the greatest number of fathers, to official hospital policy while the rest claimed it was entirely their decision. Half of the non-attenders expressed the desire to have been present while a large percentage of mothers were said to have wanted them to be present. The small number of fathers who attended the birth felt strong and satisfied. In respect to early fatherhood, three main themes were explored: reaction to fatherhood, enjoyment of the child and involvement in childcare. All three dimensions were strongly correlated.     In Athens, Greece, 157 fathers of 4-to-6-week-old newborns completed a questionnaire as part of a study examining their reactions to being present at delivery (if, indeed, they were present), their expectations about the child, and their child care practices. Just 16 fathers (10%) were present during childbirth. Most of the fathers (68%) who did not attend the delivery claimed the hospital policy forbade their presence during delivery, while most of the remaining fathers (29%) chose not to attend. 64% of the fathers who could not attend for other reasons would have liked to have attended the delivery. Further, 73% of mothers would have preferred the fathers' presence during delivery. The fathers who were present during childbirth reported that their attendance resulted in a closer emotion bond with their partner and newborn. In fact, 71% either cried or felt like crying. Almost none of the fathers believed that a woman's place was in the home. 92% played with the newborn daily. 16% to 25% were actively involved in child care (e.g., walking with the infant, bathing, and changing diapers). 68% wanted to spend more time with the newborn. 92% looked forward to coming home to be with their wife and newborn. On the other hand, 50% felt too tired to care for the infant and 42% though it was difficult to cope with the baby. Reaction to fatherhood, enjoyment of the child, and involvement in child care were all significantly correlated with each other (p .0001), especially enjoyment of the child and involvement in child care. The more emotionally depressed a father was, the more likely it was that he did not like fatherhood (p .0001).

489,Triangulation in cross-cultural research of child development in Jamaica,"Triangulation is the use of multiple concepts and methods to study a single phenomenon. Ethnographic field studies and standardized measures of development were used in a study of long-term effects of perinatal cannabis (marijuana) use in Jamaica. The study was launched in 1983 in order to evaluate the effects of cannabis (or ganja, as it is called in Jamaica) consumption during pregnancy and lactation on infants from birth to school age in rural communities. Some researchers reported symptoms such as increased startles, high-pitched cry in the newborn, shortened gestation, and low birth weight. The project was based in St. Thomas, where ganja use is widespread. The ethnographic part involved home observations and interviews of each child in selected communities. The clinical component included monitoring 60 pregnant women (30 users and 30 nonusers) and their offspring from birth through age 5. The instruments for evaluation included the Brazelton Neonatal Assessment Scale (BNAS), the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA, for children aged 2 years 6 months to 8 years 6 months), and the Behavioral Style Questionnaire (BSQ, for temperament in 3 to 7 year olds). The MSCA and BSQ had to be adapted to local culture, partly because of different uses of words in the rural dialect and cultural experience. The MSCA modifications included the elimination of time limits, changes in language, and culturally correct alternative responses. Five of 72 items on the BSQ were modified. Most scores fell in the middle range of about 4, similar to the North American scores, except for the lower mean in the category of Threshold of Responsiveness, because of an unanticipated cultural difference.

Through a historical review and an examination of studies and measurement techniques, the utility of quantifying infant crying is discussed. Although duration and timing of infant crying may be a practical concern for families and health professionals, the effectiveness of soothing interventions may not be best examined by attempts to measure unit reductions in infant crying. Rather, developing an understanding of infant crying within the context of parent‚Äìinfant relationships may have more utility. Understanding infant crying in context may provide direction to the selection of soothing interventions and to more appropriate measures of the effectiveness of such interventions.

493,Evaluation of swallowing in children with vomiting after feeding,"Vomiting after feeding is a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and of eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), which are considered to be a cause of infant feeding disorder. The objective of the present study was to evaluate swallowing in children with feeding disorder manifested by vomiting after feeding. Using clinical and videofluoroscopic methods we studied the swallowing of 37 children with vomiting after feeding (mean age=15.4 months), and of 15 healthy children (mean age=20.5 months). In the videofluoroscopic examination the children swallowed a free volume of milk and 5 ml of mashed banana, both mixed with barium sulfate. We evaluated five swallows of liquid and five swallows of paste. The videofluoroscopic examination was recorded at 60 frames/s. Patients had difficulty during feeding, pneumonia, respiratory distress, otitis, and irritability more frequently than controls. During feeding, children with vomiting, choke were irritable, and refused food more frequently than controls, and during the videofluoroscopic examination the patients had more backward movement of the head than controls for both the liquid and paste boluses. There was no difference in the timing of oral swallowing transit, pharyngeal swallowing transit, or pharyngeal clearance between patients and controls. We conclude that children with vomiting after feeding may have difficulties in accepting feeding, although they have no alteration of oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing.","Duca, A.

Local and systemic reactions to the vaccine were mostly mild and transient, and almost all had resolved by 3 days after vaccination. The most common systemic reactions were irritability, restlessness, and unusual crying. Only 3 infants had fever of > or = 40 degrees C after any vaccination. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. Most health workers taking part in the study thought that combined vaccines were better than separate vaccinations.

497,The Hunter's Hope Krabbe family database,"The objective was to identify presenting signs and symptoms, age at onset of symptoms and diagnosis, and survival in a large population of children with Krabbe disease. In 1997, Hunter's Hope Foundation began collecting clinical data on patients who had been diagnosed with Krabbe disease. As of June 2006, 334 families had returned questionnaires. Deidentified data were analyzed, including country of origin, sex, age at onset of symptoms, symptoms before diagnosis, age at diagnosis, symptoms after diagnosis, initial diagnosis, and survival. Seventy-one percent of patients developed symptoms at 0 to 6 months of age, 19% between 7 and 12 months, and 10% at 13 months + (13 months-5.5 years). The most common initial symptoms for age 0 to 12 months were crying and irritability, stiffness, and seizures. Older children were more likely to present with gait disturbances or loss of milestones. Survival differed according to age at onset of symptoms. Children with the early infantile phenotype (onset 0 to 6 months) had significantly worse survivals than either those with onset at 7 to 12 months or at 13 months to 5.5 years. Given that neither galactocerebrosidase activity nor mutation analysis reliably predict disease severity, the data from this study should help investigators recognize the earliest symptoms of the disease, as well as increase awareness of age of onset and natural history of the various phenotypes.","Duffner, P.

500,Nutritional management of cow's milk allergy in children: An update,"Cow's milk is one of the most common foods responsible for allergic reactions in children. Cow's milk allergy (CMA) involves immunoglobulin E (IgE)- and non-IgE-mediated reactions, the latter being both variable and nonspecific. Guidelines thus emphasize the need for physicians to recognize the specific syndromes of CMA and to respect strict diagnostic modalities. Whatever the clinical pattern of CMA, the mainstay of treatment is the elimination from the diet of cow's milk proteins. The challenge is that both the disease and the elimination diet may result in insufficient height and weight gain and bone mineralization. If, during CMA, the mother is not able or willing to breastfeed, the child must be fed a formula adapted to CMA dietary management, during infancy and later, if the disease persists. This type of formula must be adequate in terms of allergic efficacy and nutritional safety. In older children, when CMA persists, the use of cow's milk baked or heated at a sufficient temperature, frequently tolerated by children with CMA, may help alleviate the stringency of the elimination diet. Guidance on the implementation of the elimination diet by qualified healthcare professionals is always necessary. This guidance should also include advice to ensure adequate bone growth, especially relating to calcium intake. Specific attention should be given to children presenting with several risk factors for weak bone mineral density, i.e., multiple food allergies, vitamin D deficiency, poor sun exposure, steroid use, or severe eczema. When CMA is outgrown, a prolonged elimination diet may negatively impact the quality of the diet over the long term. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Dupont, C. and Chouraqui, J.

METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of a postintervention survey administered in the perinatal unit of a community birthing hospital. Surveys were administered to mothers of newborns by perinatal nurses as part of routine process evaluation prior to hospital discharge between May 30, 2014, and May 15, 2015. RESULTS: A majority of participants (86.4%) answered all six knowledge questions correctly. Among participants who reported that the father or significant other was not present during the PURPLE education (44.1%), all (100%) reported intending to share the PURPLE information with their partners. The majority of participants (88.1%) intended to share the information with others who take care of their infants. CONCLUSION: The PURPLE abusive head trauma prevention program demonstrated positive preliminary results in knowledge and intended behavior among a population of majority Spanish-speaking participants. These findings offer an important first step toward provision of effective universal abusive head trauma prevention among growing Spanish-speaking populations. Further evaluation is needed of acceptability, retention of messages, and postintervention behavior change among Spanish-speaking participants and nurses.","Duzinski, S. V. and Guevara, L.

506,Prevalence and Predictors of Breastfeeding After Childhood Abuse,"Objective To describe the prevalence and predictors of breastfeeding intent and outcomes in women with histories of childhood maltreatment trauma (CMT), including those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Design Secondary analysis of a prospective observational cohort study of the effects of PTSD on perinatal outcomes. Setting Prenatal clinics in three health systems in the Midwestern United States. Participants Women older than 18 years expecting their first infants, comprising three groups: women who experienced CMT but did not have PTSD (CMT-resilient), women with a history of CMT and PTSD (CMT-PTSD), and women with no history of CMT (CMT-nonexposed). Methods Secondary analysis of an existing data set in which first-time mothers were well-characterized on trauma history, PTSD, depression, feeding plans, feeding outcomes, and several other factors relevant to odds of breastfeeding success. Results Intent to breastfeed was similar among the three groups. Women in the CMT-resilient group were twice as likely to breastfeed exclusively at 6¬†weeks (60.5%) as women in the CMT-PTSD group (31.1%). Compared with women in the CMT-nonexposed group, women in the CMT-resilient group were more likely to exclusively breastfeed. Four factors were associated with increased likelihood of any breastfeeding at 6¬†weeks: prenatal intent to breastfeed, childbirth education, partnered, and a history of CMT. Four factors were associated with decreased odds of breastfeeding: African American race, PTSD, major depression, and low level of education (high school or less). Conclusion Posttraumatic stress disorder is more important than childhood maltreatment trauma history in determining likelihood of breastfeeding success. Further research on the promotion of breastfeeding among PTSD-affected women who have experienced CMT is indicated. ¬© 2017 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses","Eagen-Torkko, M. and Low, L.

508,Prompts to eat novel and familiar fruits and vegetables in families with 1-3 year-old children: Relationships with food acceptance and intake,"Toddlers often go through a picky eating phase, which can make it difficult to introduce new foods into the diet. A better understanding of how parents' prompts to eat fruits and vegetables are related to children's intake of these foods will help promote healthy eating habits 60 families recorded all toddler meals over one day, plus a meal in which parents introduced a novel fruit/vegetable to the child. Videos were coded for parent and child behaviors. Parents completed a feeding style questionnaire and three 24-h dietary recalls about their children's intake.Parents made, on average, 48 prompts for their children to eat more during the main meals in a typical day, mostly of the neutral type. Authoritarian parents made the most prompts, and used pressure the most often. In the novel food situation, it took an average of 2.5 prompts before the child tasted the new food. The most immediately successful prompt for regular meals across food types was modeling. There was a trend for using another food as a reward to work less well than a neutral prompt for encouraging children to try a novel fruit or vegetable.More frequent prompts to eat fruits and vegetables during typical meals were associated with higher overall intake of these food groups. More prompts for children to try a novel vegetable was associated with higher overall vegetable intake, but this pattern was not seen for fruits, suggesting that vegetable variety may be more strongly associated with intake. Children who ate the most vegetables had parents who used more ""reasoning"" prompts, which may have become an internalized motivation to eat these foods, but this needs to be tested explicitly using longer-term longitudinal studies. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Edelson, L.

A sample of 45 women who had scored either high (>12) or low (<9) on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 2 months postpartum were subsequently filmed in interactions with their infants when they reached 15-18 months of age. The films were coded using the Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment Scale, and behavioural scores for the two groups were compared. Children of high EPDS scorers showed less attention skills in a free play situation and were more likely to be classified as having either an insecure attachment to their mothers or a secure attachment that showed restricted joy. Cluster analysis showed a group of nine children with impaired mother-child interaction. Seven of these children had mothers with high EPDS scores. The findings provide evidence that children of high EPDS scorers developed 'representations' of the mother and the interaction with her as less joyful, which seem to remain beyond the period of the mother's depressed mood.","Edhborg, M. and Lundh, W. and Seimyr, L. and Widstr√∂m, A.

Maternal depression was measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and parents' perceptions of the child's temperament by the Infant Characteristic Questionnaire (ICQ) at 2 months. One year postpartum, parents' experience of parenthood was investigated by Experience of Motherhood/Fatherhood Questionnaire (EMQ/EFQ). The results indicated that 'depressed' mothers and their partners perceived their children as more temperamentally 'difficult' than couples in families with a non-depressed mother. Mothers who had been 'depressed', but not their partners, were less satisfied with experiences of parenthood at 1 year than parents in families without postnatal 'depression'. Our findings suggested a relationship between parental ratings of a 'difficult' child with maternal 'depression'.","Edhborg, M. and Seimyr, L. and Lundh, W. and Widstrom, A. M.",0,405

Studies that focus only on families living in poverty do not capture the breadth of experiences associated with economic deprivation. This study breaks down economic deprivation into two constructs, poverty and material hardship, and examines their relationship with academic failure later in childhood. Using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 3591), this study examines how early childhood economic deprivation, measured by material hardship and income poverty, works through different cognitive and behavioral pathways, linking deprivation to grade repetition in elementary school. The findings of this study suggest that early childhood poverty works through cognitive pathways while material hardship works through behavioral pathways. Modeling these pathways by gender indicate that the link between hardship and externalizing behavior may be driven by gender differences, as this pathway is significant for males but not females. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Edmunds, C.",0,406

514,The use of breast-feeding for pain relief during neonatal immunization injections,"The objective of this study was to examine the pain-relieving effect of breast-feeding during immunization injections in healthy neonates. Sixty-six healthy infants returning to a clinic for their second-, third-, or fourth-month immunization with intramuscular diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis were randomized to be breast-fed before, during, and after the injection or to be given the injection according to routine clinic procedure (no breast-feeding). To assess the pain responses of the neonates during and after immunization, we noted their heart rates, oxygen saturation levels, and length of crying. The crying time was shorter in the experimental (breast-feeding) group (M +/- SD duration, 35.85 +/- 40.11 seconds) than in the control group (M +/- SD duration, 76.24 +/- 49.61 seconds","Efe, E. and Ozer, Z.

515,Scientific Opinion on the essential composition of infant and follow-on formulae,"Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the essential composition of infant and follow-on formula. This opinion reviews the opinion provided by the Scientific Committee on Food in 2003 on the essential requirements of infant and follow-on formulae in light of more recent evidence and by considering the Panel's opinion of October 2013 on nutrient requirements and dietary intakes of infants and young children in the European Union. The minimum content of a nutrient in formula proposed in this opinion is derived from the intake levels the Panel had considered adequate for the majority of infants in the first six months of life in its previous opinion and an average amount of formula consumed during this period. From a nutritional point of view, the minimum contents of nutrients in infant and follow-on formula proposed by the Panel cover the nutritional needs of virtually all healthy infants born at term and there is no need to exceed these amounts in formulae, as nutrients which are not used or stored have to be excreted and this may put a burden on the infant's metabolism. Therefore, the Panel emphasises that maximum amounts should be interpreted not as target values but rather as upper limits of a range which should not be exceeded. ¬© 2014 European Food Safety Authority","Efsa Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies",0,409
516,Dietary Reference Values for choline,"Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel¬†on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) derives Dietary Reference Values (DRVs) for choline. In this Opinion, the Panel¬†considers dietary choline including choline compounds (e.g. glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin). The Panel¬†considers that none of the biomarkers of choline intake or status is suitable to derive DRVs for choline. The Panel¬†considers that Average Requirements and Population Reference Intakes for choline cannot be derived for adults, infants and children, and therefore defines Adequate Intakes (AIs). For all adults, the Panel¬†sets an AI at 400¬†mg/day based on the average observed choline intake in healthy populations in the European Union and in consideration of the amounts of choline needed to replete about 70% of depleted subjects who showed signs of organ dysfunction in a depletion/repletion study. For all infants aged 7‚Äì11¬†months, the Panel¬†proposes an AI of 160¬†mg/day, based on upwards extrapolation from the estimated choline intake of exclusively breast-fed infants from birth to 6¬†months. For all children aged 1‚Äì17¬†years, the Panel¬†proposes AIs, based on downwards extrapolation from the adult AI, applying growth factors. These AIs range from 140¬†mg/day (1‚Äì3¬†years) to 400¬†mg/day (15‚Äì17¬†years). For pregnant women, the Panel¬†derives an AI of 480¬†mg/day, calculated by extrapolation from the AI for non-pregnant women and the mean gestational increase in body weight. For lactating women, the amount of choline secreted per day in human milk during the first 6¬†months of exclusive breastfeeding (120¬†mg/day) is added to the AI for non-lactating women and an AI of 520¬†mg/day is set. ¬© 2016 European Food Safety Authority.

517,Evaluation of child development: beyond the neuromotor aspect,"Objective To review the epidemiology and update the scientific knowledge on the problems of development and behavior in childhood, and the recommendations for the role of the pediatrician in identifying and managing delays and disturbances in child development and mental health. Sources A search for relevant literature was performed in the PubMed and Scopus databases and publications of the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child. Summary of the findings With the decline in the incidence of communicable diseases in children, problems with development, behavior, and emotional regulation are increasingly becoming a part of the work of pediatricians, yet many are not trained and feel uncomfortable about this extension of their role. The available screening tools for child development and behavior are reviewed, and a ‚Äòschool readiness‚Äô checklist is presented, together with recommendations on how the pediatrician can incorporate developmental surveillance into routine practice, aware of the need for children to acquire social, emotional, and cognitive skills so that they can develop their full potential. Conclusions The pediatrician's role in the future will include both physical and mental health, recognizing that social development, resilience, and emotional maturity are as important as physical growth and neuromotor skills in a child's life course. ¬© 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria","Eickmann, S.

However, the exact timing of adverse rapid postnatal weight gain is unclear. Objective: The objective was to examine the associations between rapid weight gain in infancy and in early childhood in relation to body composition at age 17 y. Design: This prospective cohort study was conducted in 248 (103 males) singletons and their mothers. Height and weight were measured at birth, 6 mo, and 3 and 6 y. The rates of weight gain during infancy (0-6 mo) and early childhood (3-6 y) were calculated as changes in sex- and age-adjusted weight SD scores during these time periods. At 17 y, body composition was measured by air-displacement plethysmography. Results: Increasing weight gain during infancy and early childhood were both independently associated with larger body mass index, fat mass, relative fat mass, fat-free mass, and waist circumference at 17 y (P < 0.005 for all","Ekelund, U. and Ong, K. and Linn√©, Y. and Neovius, M. and Brage, S. and Dunger, D.

520,Prediction of 3- to 5-Month Outcomes from Signs of Acute Bilirubin Toxicity in Newborn Infants,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of the bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) score to predict residual neurologic and auditory disability and to document the relationship of BIND score to total serum bilirubin (TSB) concentration. STUDY DESIGN: The BIND score (assessing mental status, muscle tone, and cry patterns) was obtained serially at 6- to 8-hour intervals in 220 near-term and full-term infants with severe hyperbilirubinemia. Neurologic and/or auditory outcomes at 3-5 months of age were correlated with the highest calculated BIND score. The BIND score was also correlated with TSB. RESULTS: Follow-up neurologic and auditory examinations were performed for 145/202 (72%) surviving infants. All infants with severe acute bilirubin encephalopathy (BIND scores 7-9) either died or suffered residual neurologic and auditory impairment.

525,Out of the abyss of colic: a view through the fathers' eyes,"PURPOSE: To elucidate the experience of fathers living with a colicky infant. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Interpretive phenomenology using in-depth interviews with 10 fathers of colicky infants. Reiterative interview reading, repeated meaning unit sorting, going back to the literature, and discussions gave way to emerging themes. FINDINGS: The overall experience is one of ""falling into and arising from the crying abyss together as a family."" Four themes emerged: (a) falling in, (b) hitting bottom, (c) weaving strands to make a rope, and (d) climbing out. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: From their stories, fathers provide insight useful to nurses assisting families of colicky infants through a very difficult time. Nurses should talk to fathers directly about the possibility of colic, and teach both parents what it is, how long it usually lasts, and what can be done about it. Anticipatory guidance as well as discussion about colic during newborn health visits can help parents to vocalize their feelings, and learn what actions to take when the stress of colic becomes overwhelming.","Ellett, M.

529,Comparison of common interventions for the treatment of infantile colic: A systematic review of reviews and guidelines,"To conduct a systematic review of systematic reviews and national guidelines to assess the effectiveness of four treatment approaches (manual therapy, probiotics, proton pump inhibitors and simethicone) on colic symptoms including infant crying time, sleep distress and adverse events. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane and Mantis for studies published between 2009 and 2019. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews and guidelines that used evidence and expert panel opinion. Three reviewers independently selected articles by title, abstract and full paper review. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Selected studies were assessed for quality using modified standardised checklists by two authors. Meta-analysed data for our outcomes of interest were extracted and narrative conclusions were assessed. Results Thirty-two studies were selected. High-level evidence showed that probiotics were most effective for reducing crying time in breastfed infants (range -25 min to -65 min over 24 hours). Manual therapies had moderate to low-quality evidence showing reduced crying time (range -33 min to -76 min per 24 hours). Simethicone had moderate to low evidence showing no benefit or negative effect. One meta-analysis did not support the use of proton pump inhibitors for reducing crying time and fussing. Three national guidelines unanimously recommended the use of education, parental reassurance, advice and guidance and clinical evaluation of mother and baby. Consensus on other advice and treatments did not exist. Conclusions The strongest evidence for the treatment of colic was probiotics for breastfed infants, followed by weaker but favourable evidence for manual therapy indicated by crying time. Both forms of treatment carried a low risk of serious adverse events. The guidance reviewed did not reflect these findings.

531,Oxygen in nitrogen versus nitrous oxide during pediatric general anesthesia,"BACKGROUND: Induction of anesthesia decreases lung volumes, giving areas of non-ventilated lung. Nitrogen is a slowly-absorbed gas that could prevent resorption of gases from these closed spaces, preventing atelectasis and improving oxygen saturations during recovery. METHODS: We evaluated oxygen saturations during emergence after intra-operative administration of 33% oxygen in nitrogen versus 33% oxygen in nitrous oxide in 62 children having elective urologic surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to either group A (2.5 L/min air with 0.5 L/min oxygen) or group N (2 L/min nitrous oxide and 1 L/min oxygen). Flowmeters were covered to maintain blinding. Anesthetic technique was standardized (laryngeal mask airway, caudal, halothane, and deep extubation). Patients breathed room air during emergence, while a blinded observer recorded duration of desaturations by stopwatch for 15 min. RESULTS: We found similar desaturations in both groups. The difference in desaturations < 94% at an interim 2-min total probably reflects diffusion hypoxia and was not significant at 15 min. The frequency of desaturations < 87% during emergence was significantly greater in children who were crying during induction. CONCLUSIONS: The intra-operative use of air versus nitrous oxide has no substantial effect on oxygen saturations during emergence from anesthesia in children. These results are consistent with a recently published mathematical model.","Elwood, T. and Hutchinson, E.",0,419

A convenience sample of mothers with infants younger than 4 months who presented to our urban, tertiary care PED was surveyed in English or Spanish using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS). Demographic information was collected. Members of the study team evaluated and counseled those mothers who screened positive on the EPDS (score ‚â• 10). During the PED visit, social work consultation and mental health resources were also offered. Resource use and additional mental health needs were assessed, with a follow-up telephone call 4 weeks after the initial ED presentation. Performance characteristics of a brief, 3-question anxiety subset were compared using a positive EPDS as the reference standard.

534,Antecedents of picky eating behaviour in young children,"Background: Picky eating behaviour in young children is a common concern for parents. Objective: To investigate early life factors which are associated with a child becoming a picky eater. Design: Singleton children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children were studied prospectively (n = 5758‚Äì6608). Parental-completion questionnaires were used to define ‚Äòpicky eating‚Äô status at age 3 years, and child and parental feeding behaviours and practices throughout the first 2 years of life. Multinomial logistic regression models with 3 levels of picky eating (not, somewhat and very picky) as the dependant variables tested associations with antecedent variables, from pregnancy, and the first and second year of life, separately, then combining all significant variables in a final model. Results: Feeding difficulties during complementary feeding and late introduction of lumpy foods (after 9 months) were associated with increased likelihood of the child being very picky. A strong predictor was the child being choosy at 15 months, particularly if the mother was worried about this behaviour. Many children (56%) were considered to be choosy at 15 months: 17% went on to be very picky at 3 years if the mother was not worried, compared with 50% if the mother was very worried by the choosiness. The mother providing fresh fruit and eating the same meal as the child were protective against later ‚Äòpicky eating‚Äô while feeding ready-prepared food was predictive. Conclusion: Advice and support to parents could help to reduce picky eating behaviour. Parents should be encouraged to introduce lumpy foods by 9 months, to feed fresh foods particularly fruit, and to eat with their children. Parents should be reassured that choosiness is normal and to continue to provide a variety of foods. ¬© 2018 The Authors","Emmett, P. M. and Hays, N. P. and Taylor, C. M.",0,421

539,Phthalate exposure in pregnant women and newborns - The urinary metabolite excretion pattern differs distinctly,"Some phthalates are endocrine disruptors and reproductive and developmental toxicants. Data on newborn phthalate exposure and elimination characteristics are scarce. We determined 21 urinary phthalate metabolites (indicating exposure to 11 parent phthalates) in two study approaches: in the first approach we collected the urine of 20 healthy newborns at days 2-5 post partum together with 47 urine samples of 7 women during pregnancy. In the second fine tuned approach we collected first urine samples of 9 healthy newborns together with their mother's urine shortly before birth. To ensure full and contamination free collection of the newborns first urines we used special adhesive urine bags for children. All urine samples revealed ubiquitous exposures to phthalates comparable to other populations. Metabolite levels in the newborns first day urine samples were generally lower than in all other samples. However, the newborns urines (both first and day 2-5 urines) showed a metabolite pattern distinctly different from the maternal and general population samples: in the newborns urines the carboxy-metabolites of the long chain phthalates (DEHP, DiNP, DiDP) were the by far dominant metabolites with a relative share in the metabolite spectrum up to 6 times higher than in maternal urine. Oppositely, for the short chain phthalates (DBP, DiBP) oxidized metabolites seemed to be less favored than the simple monoesters in the newborns urines. The skewed metabolite distribution in the newborns urine warrants further investigation in terms of early phthalate metabolism, the quantity of internal phthalate exposure of the fetus/newborn and its possible health effects. ¬© 2013.","Enke, U. and Schleussner, E. and P√§lmke, C. and Seyfarth, L. and Koch, H.

540,The effect of maternal voice for procedural pain in paediatric intensive care unit: A randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the maternal voice in reducing pain during painful procedures in children between one and three years old receiving treatment in paediatric intensive care unit. DESIGN AND METHODS: This research was designed as a randomised controlled experimental study. Sixty children were randomised into two groups, the maternal-voice group and the controls. The children in the maternal-voice group listened to the maternal voice during the procedure. Although questionnaire forms were used to determine the descriptive characteristics of infants, the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) pain assessment scale was used to evaluate pain level. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were also measured. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the pain, heart rate and oxygen saturation levels between the maternal-voice and control groups. Pain levels and heart rates of the children in the experimental group during and after the painful procedures were much lower, and their oxygen saturations were higher than those of the children in the control group. PRACTIC IMPLICATIONS: Distraction methods, such as listening to the maternal voice, should be used as a nursing intervention to reduce pain and decrease heart rate and increaseoxygen saturation in children during painful procedures in the paediatric intensive care unit. The maternal voice is recommended as a helpful option in cases when a pain control method is required.

541,Screening for dysregulation among toddlers born very low birth weight,"BACKGROUND: Children born very low birth weight (VLBW) are at increased risk for regulatory difficulties. However, identifying toddlers at risk has been impeded by a lack of screening measures appropriate for this population. METHODS: We studied the nature of dysregulation in toddlers born VLBW (N = 32) using the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA) Dysregulation Domain, a multiscale (including negative emotionality, sleep, eating, and sensory sensitivity) screening assessment of regulatory abilities. RESULTS: As evidence of construct validity for this population, ITSEA scores for toddlers born VLBW showed greater overall dysregulation, as well as sensory sensitivity, compared with an ITSEA manual-based premature/LBW sample. This was seen both by higher overall Dysregulation Domain scores and higher percentages of toddlers exceeding the clinical cutoff levels. Furthermore, compared with age- and gender-matched full-term toddlers, the VLBW toddlers displayed gender-specific dysregulation profiles. CONCLUSIONS: The greater overall dysregulation in VLBW toddlers compared with premature/LBW toddlers suggests that early screening for such difficulties among VLBW toddlers is warranted, and this study provides preliminary evidence that the ITSEA Dysregulation Domain may be an appropriate screening measure.

542,Oral glucose and venepuncture reduce blood sampling pain in newborns,"The objectives of this study were to measure pain symptoms in healthy full-term newborns undergoing routine blood sampling with different methods. The 120 study Ss were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 groups with 30 babies in each: venipuncture or heel stick, with or without oral glucose administration. Pain was assessed from the duration of crying within the first 3 min, the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) and changes in heart rate. When the babies received 1 ml 30% glucose prior to skin puncture there was no significant difference between the heel stick and venipuncture group either in mean crying time (12.9 and 11.6 sec, respectively) or in PIPP score (3.9 and 3.3). When no glucose was given crying time was significantly longer in the heel stick group than in the venipuncture group (57.3 and 26.8 sec, respectively) and the mean PIPP scores were 8.4 and 6.0, respectively. This study suggests that if oral glucose is given prior to skin puncture the choice of blood sampling method has no impact on the pain symptoms.

RESULTS: The babies in the control group experienced severe pain and the babies in the breastfeeding group felt moderate pain during the vaccine injections (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). The NIPS score of the babies in the breastfeeding group was lower than the control group during the vaccine injections. The breastfeeding group spent less time crying, and had lower heart rates and higher oxygen saturation values during vaccine injections Conclusion: Breastfeeding prevented increased heart rates, duration of crying, NIPS, falling oxygen saturation, and reduced pain during the invasive procedures in newborns more than control group.","Erkul, M. and Efe, E.",0,429

We investigated the relationship between prenatal exposure to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and neurodevelopment of Mexican farm-workers' children in California. METHODS. Participants from the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas study, a birth cohort study, included 360 singletons with maternal serum measures of p,p‚Ä≤-DDT, o,p‚Ä≤-DDT, and p,p‚Ä≤-DDE. Psychomotor development and mental development were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development at 6, 12, and 24 months. RESULTS. We found a ‚àº2-point decrease in Psychomotor Developmental Index scores with each 10-fold increase in p,p‚Ä≤-DDT levels at 6 and 12 months (but not 24 months) and p,p‚Ä≤-DDE levels at 6 months only. We found no association with mental development at 6 months but a 2- to 3-point decrease in Mental Developmental Index scores for p,p‚Ä≤-DDT and o,p‚Ä≤-DDT at 12 and 24 months, corresponding to 7- to 10-point decreases across the exposure range. Even when mothers had substantial exposure, breastfeeding was usually associated positively with Bayley scale scores. CONCLUSIONS. Prenatal exposure to DDT, and to a lesser extent DDE, was associated with neurodevelopmental delays during early childhood, although breastfeeding was found to be beneficial even among women with high levels of exposure. Countries considering the use of DDT should weigh its benefit in eradicating malaria against the negative associations found in this first report on DDT and human neurodevelopment.","Eskenazi, B. and Marks, A.

549,Response to Infant Cry in Clinically Depressed and Non-Depressed Mothers,"BACKGROUND: Bowlby and Ainsworth hypothesized that maternal responsiveness is displayed in the context of infant distress. Depressed mothers are less responsive to infant distress vocalizations (cry) than non-depressed mothers. The present study focuses on acoustical components of infant cry that give rise to responsive caregiving in clinically depressed (n = 30) compared with non-depressed mothers (n = 30) in the natural setting of the home. METHODS: Analyses of infant and mother behaviors followed three paths: (1) tests of group differences in acoustic characteristics of infant cry, (2) tests of group differences of mothers' behaviors during their infant's crying, and (3) tree-based modeling to ascertain which variable(s) best predict maternal behaviors during infant cry. RESULTS: (1) Infants of depressed mothers cried as frequently and for equal durations as infants of non-depressed mothers","Esposito, G. and Manian, N. and Truzzi, A. and Bornstein, M. H.",0,433
553,Maternal emotional availability and infant smiling and crying at 5 months of age,"In this observational study, we examined relations of maternal emotional availability with infant smiling and crying, two behaviors that represent infants' principal social communicative functions. Fifty-four mother-infant dyads were analyzed using two independent observation systems: (a) the infant socioemotional behaviors and (b) the Emotional Availability Scales. The amount of infant smiling differentiated dyads with different levels of maternal emotional availability. The more infants smile, the greater the odds that their mothers will be more emotionally available. By contrast, no association for cry was found with maternal emotional availability. These results are consistent with the burgeoning literature on the Emotional Availability construct that stresses the importance of expressed positive emotions as determinants of the quality of motherinfant interaction. ¬© 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

554,Colic in breast-milk-fed infants: Treatment by temporary substitution of Neocate infant formula,"Infant colic is a common problem characterized by excessive crying and fussing. We examined whether colic symptoms of exclusively breast-milk-fed infants would be improved by temporary substitution of Neocate, an amino acid-based infant formula, for breast milk. Six infants with colic were studied using Barr-type infant behavior diaries for a 3-5 d baseline period while they continued exclusive breast-milk-feeding, followed by a 4-8 d intervention period of exclusive Neocate feeding. All infants showed improvement in distressed behavior during intervention","Estep, D. C. and Kulczycki A, Jr.",0,435
555,Treatment of infant colic with amino acid-based infant formula: A preliminary study,"Infant colic, a common disorder of infancy, is characterized by excessive crying and fussing. In this preliminary study we examined whether Neocate, an amino acid-based formula, would be accepted by formula-fed infants with colic, 3-7 wk of age, and whether Neocate would improve their symptoms. Six infants with colic were studied using Barr-type infant behavior diaries for 3-6 d on their current formula and then for 5-17 d on Neocate exclusively. All infants tolerated Neocate well and all improved, usually within 1-2 d. The total time spent crying and fussing was reduced by an average of 45%, representing a decrease of 1.0 to 5.2 h daily. After colic symptoms improved, infants were challenged with oral doses of 75 mg of bovine IgG at a 1 mg/ml concentration in order to assess its potential role in colic. Bovine IgG challenges resulted in increased crying and fussing behavior, suggesting that this protein may be etiologically important.","Estep, D. C. and Kulczycki Jr, A.",0,436
556,Perceptions of preschoolers' vulnerability by mothers who had delivered preterm,"Assessed mothers who did and did not identify their children as vulnerable on a number of variables including perception of their child's behavior problems and their own sense of parental control. Children were also examined to determine their developmental abilities. Participants included 50 preschoolers who were born prematurely, their mothers, and their medical care providers. The mothers' response to the Vulnerable Child Scale was used to identify children as vulnerable and nonvulnerable. Mothers who perceived their children as vulnerable also rated them on the Child Behavior Checklist 2/3 as having more somatic problems and as being more aggressive, destructive, and poorly socialized. Additionally, these mothers expressed a diminished sense of parental efficacy and less control of their child's behavior as measured by the Parental Locus of Control Scale. However, results from the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities and the medical care provider's questionnaire revealed no differences between the groups of children. Overall findings suggest preschoolers born prematurely whose mothers perceive them as vulnerable are at risk for the Vulnerable Child Syndrome described by Green and Solnit (1964). ¬© 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Estroff, D.

559,Luminal contents from the gut of colicky infants induce visceral hypersensitivity in mice,"Background: The pathophysiology of infantile colic is poorly understood, though various studies report gut microbiota dysbiosis in colicky infants. We aimed to test the hypothesis that colic-related dysbiosis is associated with visceral hypersensitivity triggered by an altered luminal milieu. Methods: Fecal samples from seven colicky and seven non-colicky infants were studied. Fecal supernatants (FS) were infused into the colons of C57/Bl6 mice (n=10/specimen). Visceral sensitivity was subsequently assessed in the animals by recording their abdominal muscle response to colorectal distension (CRD) by electromyography (EMG). Serine and cysteine protease activities were assessed in FS with specific substrates. Infant fecal microbiota composition was analyzed by DNA extraction and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Key Results: FS from colicky infants triggered higher EMG activity than FS from non-colicky infants in response to both the largest CRD volumes and overall, as assessed by the area under the curve of the EMG across all CRD volumes. Infant crying time strongly correlated with mouse EMG activity. Microbiota richness and phylogenetic diversity were increased in the colicky group, without showing prominent microbial composition alterations. Only Bacteroides vulgatus and Bilophila wadsworthia were increased in the colicky group. Bacteroides vulgatus abundance positively correlated with visceral sensitivity. No differences were found in protease activities. Conclusions & Inferences: Luminal contents from colicky infants trigger visceral hypersensitivity, which may explain the excessive crying behavior of these infants. Additional studies are required to determine the nature of the compounds involved, their mechanism of action, and the potential implications of intestinal microbiota in their generation. ¬© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Eutam√®ne, H. and Garcia-Rodenas, C.

Quinolone resistance has emerged as an increasing problem among persons with Campylobacter infection over the past decade, but the clinical consequences are unclear. Methods. A case-comparison study of patients infected with ciprofloxacin-resistant or ciprofloxacin-susceptible Campylobacter species was conducted in Wales during the period 2003-2004. Campylobacter isolates were classified as resistant or susceptible to ciprofloxacin on the basis of standardized disk diffusion methods. Participants were interviewed by telephone at the time of illness, 3 months later, and 6 months later to compare disease severity, duration of illness, and medium-term clinical outcomes. Results. There was no difference between 145 persons with ciprofloxacin-resistant infection and 411 with ciprofloxacin-susceptible infection with regard to the severity or duration of acute illness. Mean duration of diarrhea was similar in patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant versus ciprofloxacin-susceptible infection (8.2 vs. 8.6 days","Evans, M. R. and Northey, G. and Sarvotham, T.

It has been shown that disordered cyclic sleep organization in IUGR newborns indicates the degree of intrauterine brain damage as a result of chronic hypoxia. The absence of cyclic sleep organization, the disordered formation of the paradoxical phase combined with delayed development of tonic, congenital reflex reactions, and low melatonin production give evidence of severe brain damage, which warrants combined therapy in the early neonatal period of life. ¬© 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","Evsyukova, I.

564,The probiotic use in neonatology,"Neonatal age represents a key moment for the establishment of resident intestinal microflora and for the development of a beneficial relationship between microbiota and the host, which is essential for maintaining health. Manipulation of neonatal microbiota through the use of probiotics has been studied for treatment of neonatal diseases and for early prevention of pediatric diseases. The objective of the present review is to consider potential benefits of probiotic supplementation in prevention and treatment of some neonatal and infantile disorders. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a fearful disease of preterm infants, in which the intestinal dysbiosis of the premature intestinal tract has a potential pathogenic role. Administration of a probiotic supplementation to premature neonates for preventing NEC has been extensively studied with encouraging results, suggesting potential benefits of this kind of intervention. Hospitalized children (or neonates) are exposed to different pharmacological treatments, including antibiotics, and are at risk of developing nosocomial infections. In literature, several studies have tried to clarify the role of probiotic supplementation in the prevention of neonatal nosocomial infections such as, Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary and respiratory tractinfections. Infantile colic, known as excessive crying during the first few months of life, is a common problem in healthy infants affecting up to 20% of cases, and the composition of intestinal microbiota has been addressed as a risk factor. Studies have shown thatinadequate lactobacilli in the first few months of life may affect intestinal fatty acid profile favoring the development of infantile colic. Some studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of probiotics as a therapeutic strategy for infantile colic but the available data is still too limited to draw definitive conclusions. Nevertheless, the clinical trials performed so far have given promising results on the reduction of the average crying time in healthy infants treated with a dose of 108 CFU of Lactobacillus reuteri for 3-4 weeks. Administration of probiotics in prenatal and neonatal age has also been studied for prevention of pediatric diseases, especially for allergies, whose incidence is continuously increasing in infants and children. The multifactorial pathogenesis of allergy includes disturbances in early colonization patterns and dysbiosis preceding the development of allergic disease. Moreover, it is well-known that the microbiota plays a pivotal role in shaping immune development and modulation. Consequently, several interventional studies have evaluated the benefits of supplementing at-risk neonates and infants, and even their expecting mothers, for preventing subsequent development of atopic diseases. Currently available results are still contrasting, preventing firm conclusions. ¬© 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Fabiano, V. and Penagini, F. and Meneghin, F. and Dilillo, D. and Ramponi, G. and Colella, G. and Scrignoli, F. and Mameli, C. and Zuccotti, G.

Ss were trained to move a crib mobile containing 10 objects by means of footkicking and were then exposed to a mobile containing only 2 of these objects. This violation of an established reward-expectation habit produced crying in 55% of the Ss. A series of univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that crying could best be predicted by measures of activity level, duration of orienting, and distress to sudden or novel stimuli, as well as the number of footkicks during contingency training. Results demonstrate that even if 2 infants have developed equivalent reward-expectation habits, they may react differently to violations of this learned expectancy based on differences in temperament.

A discriminant-function analysis revealed that females who cried differed from females who did not cry on measures of duration of orienting and latency to approach sudden or novel stimuli. No sex differences emerged in the incidence of crying or in the number of sessions completed. Females completing 1 of the 2 sessions could reliably be discriminated from those who cried during the 1st session on measures of age at testing and maternal ratings of smiling behavior. Results suggest that S loss in operant-conditioning studies is influenced by individual differences among the infants, which may or may not adversely affect external validity.

Up to now, research has focused mainly on motherhood. The aim of this study was to explore first-time fathers' experiences during early infancy of their children. Grounded theory and constant comparative method were used and 20 fathers aged 20-48 participated. Interviews were carried out in 2002-2003. 'Changing life' emerged as the core category consisting of the categories: becoming a father, alternating between work and home, changing relationship towards partner and developing relationship with their child. Changing life implied that they have left bachelor life and become responsible for a child. Becoming a father was much more fantastic than they could have imagined and they suggested that they performed childcare to the same extent as the mother when both parents were at home. Still fathers viewed the mother as the main parent, partly because of their alternating between work and home and because the mothers breast-feed the infants.

569,Infant temperament and eating style predict change in standardized weight status and obesity risk at 6 years of age,"Objective:Little research has addressed the relationships among infant temperament, eating styles and obesity risk. To address this gap, we tested whether infant temperament and eating patterns at the age of 1 year are associated with a greater increase in standardized weight status, and greater obesity risk at 6 years of age.Design:A secondary, prospective analysis of the Colorado Adoption Study was conducted. The main predictor variables were infant temperament (that is, emotionality, activity, attention span-persistence, reaction to food and soothability) and eating domains (that is, reactivity to food, predictable appetite and distractability at mealtime) at the age of 1 year, along with the body mass index (BMI) of biological mothers. The outcome measures were child weight and height (length) assessed at ages 1 through 6 years, from which weight-for-length and BMI were computed along with the standardized indexes (z-scores) and percentiles. Overweight/obesity status was computed at each year as well.Participants:A primarily White sample of 262 boys and 225 girls, assessed at ages 1 through 6 years, along with their mothers.Results:Among boys, greater attention span-persistence was associated with reduced standardized weight status gain (Œí0.15, P<0.05) and reduced obesity risk (odds ratio (OR)=0.46, P=0.06).

Maternal concerns with infants‚Äô needs can be reduced through social support. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between social support and perceived stress in the mothers of infants with colic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 200 mothers of infants with colic referred to 14 healthcare centers affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences in year 2017. A convenience sampling method was used. Demographic data form, Cohen perceived stress and Vaux‚Äôs perceived social support questionnaires were used for data collection. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: There was a statistically significant positive correlation between social support and perceived stress (r = 0.31, P = 0.001). In other words, with increase in social support, perceived stress would be increased. However, the support of the spouse in the form of childcare could reduce perceived stress in the mother (P = 0.001). Conclusions: The results of this study showed that with increase in social support, perceived stress in the mothers of infants with colic also would be increased. However, spousal assistant in childcare is accompanied by a reduction in perceived stress in mothers. ¬© 2019, Author(s).","Fakhri, B. and Hasanpoor-azghady, S. B. and Farahani, L.

573,Altered regulatory cytokine profiles in cases of pediatric respiratory syncytial virus infection,"Objectives Regulatory cytokines are associated with viral infection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation between serum regulatory cytokines concentrations and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease. Methods We enrolled 325 children aged < 24 months who were diagnosed with acute respiratory tract infection. Twenty age-matched healthy children were enrolled as controls. Nasopharyngeal swabs were analyzed to identify virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and blood samples were taken to quantify the regulatory cytokine concentrations, including interleukin (IL)-35, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-Œ≤1 using the Bio-Plex immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results RSV disease was associated with a great regulatory cytokine response than healthy children, among 89 RSV-infected patients, serum IL-35 (P =.0001) and IL-10 (P =.006) was significantly elevated in comparison with healthy controls. Young children (0< age ‚â§6 months) with RSV infection had significantly lower IL-35 and IL-10 expression but needed more oxygen therapy and more severe disease comparing with older children (12< age <24 months). Comparing with mild group, the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in children with moderate and severe disease (P =.012 and P =.005, respectively). And levels of IL-10 was inversely associated with total duration of RSV infection symptoms (r = ‚àí 0.311, P =.019). Conclusion Children with RSV infected had increased serum regulatory cytokine IL-10 and IL-35 concentrations. Elevated expression of IL-10 and IL-35 were contributed to protect hypoxia and reduce the severity of disease. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fan, R. and Wen, B. and Liu, W. and Zhang, J. and Liu, C. and Fan, C. and Qu, X.",0,451

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty children (68 boys and 52 girls aged between 1 month and two years) with a clinical suspicion of gastro-oesophageal reflux (postprandial vomiting, weight loss, failure to thrive, anaemia, night-time coughing and crying, regurgitation, etc.) were studied by contrast-enhanced CDUS and subsequently by 24-hour pH-metry. Results of the two techniques were compared using the McNemar test. RESULTS: Gastro-oesophageal reflux was detected on CDUS in 84 patients and with 24-h pH-metry in 86. In all cases of reflux, CDUS visualised the passage of contrast material from the stomach into the abdominal and middle and distal third of the thoracic oesophagus, enabling assessment of the segment of oesophagus involved by the reflux. Compared with pH-metry, CDUS had a sensitivity of 98% (p<0.0001 with McNemar's test). CONCLUSIONS: In consideration of the results obtained and particularly of the low level of invasiveness, contrast-enhanced CDUS could be used to monitor children undergoing medical or surgical treatment for the complications of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.","Farina, R. and Pennisi, F. and La Rosa, M. and Puglisi, C. and Mazzone, G. and Riva, G. and Foti, P.

577,"""Pushed"" monocanalicular intubation in children under general anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation. A preliminary report","PURPOSE: We studied the possibility of placing a new type of monocanalicular nasal intubation under general anesthesia with spontaneous mask ventilation in congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. PATIENTS AND METHOD: This was a non-randomized study of consecutive cases using a monocanalicular stent called the ""pushed Monoka"". The benefits of anchoring with meatus fixation are similar to the original Monoka device, but the probe guide or introducer is inside the silicone tube. The external diameter of the ""pushed Monoka"" is 0.96 mm (versus 0.64 mm in the traditional Monoka). There are three lengths: 30, 35, and 40 mm. General anesthesia was administered by inhalation of a halogen gas using a facial mask. The technique was selected by lacrimal exploration to evaluate the extent of the stenosis (simple or complex). The location and freedom of movement of the stent into the inferior nasal meatus was tested using a second lacrimal probe. Only simple stenosis cases with positive metal-to-metal contact were included in the study. INSERTION TECHNIQUE: The introducer pushes the stent into the lacrimal duct. The introducer should be removed from the silicone sleeve very carefully by gently pulling it out, millimeter by millimeter. This action is carried out while paying careful attention to keeping the stent aligned with the major axis of the lacrimal sac. Throughout this phase, the anchoring plug should remain in contact with the lacrimal punctum. Once the introducer is completely removed, the anchoring plug is secured into the vertical canaliculus. A single-use plug inserter was used. RESULTS: Fourteen children (18 sides) with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction were consecutively included in the study. The pushed intubations were all performed under general anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation. The average age of the children was 26.2 months (range: 14 to 46 months). The average duration of the procedure, measured between the moment that the facial mask was put into place and the child's awakening (crying, restlessness) was 14 minutes (range: 9 to 27 minutes). The most variable parameter was the use of the venous portal. The introduction of the pushed probe itself required an average 7 minutes (range: 3 to 11 minutes). None of the children showed epistaxis. In general terms, no intraoperative or postoperative complications were noted. The ""pushed Monoka"" tubes were withdrawn during postoperative appointments with a mean intubation duration of 34 days (range: 1 to 59 days). Postoperative success (absence of epiphora, absence of mucous discharge) was achieved in 88% of cases (16/18 sides). The average follow-up was 8.7 weeks (range: 3 to 26 weeks). Complications and side effects were minimal. One stent was withdrawn on day 1 due to a keratitis with respect to the anchoring plug. Three stents were spontaneously lost (16%) between day 2 and day 30. Anterior rhinoscopy found none of the stents in the inferior nasal meatus. These four cases were all considered successful as there was no postoperative epiphora noted. CONCLUSIONS: Pushed nasolacrimal intubation can be safely utilized under general anesthesia with spontaneous mask ventilation. This technique appears to be a simple and safe alternative to late and very late probing in the treatment of membranous congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction in children older than 12 months.","Fayet, B. and Racy, E. and Ruban, J.

It may affect parental feelings negatively and the parents may undertake all kinds of actions to stop excessive crying. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of infantile colic and its risk factors in infants born in District Mansehra. In this prospective study, all those newborn babies were included who were born at King Abdullah Teaching Hospital Mansehra between January 1st 2008 and March 31, 2008, and those newborn babies who were brought to children OPD for routine check-up and EPI centre for vaccination of this hospital during this time period. For every infant, gender, mode of delivery, gestational age at birth, birth weight, birth order, and mother's reproductive history were collected. These babies were seen at least once in a week up to 12 weeks and history from the mothers about the duration of crying and fussiness behaviour was recorded. At the end of 3 months the infants were again assessed and additional information on infant nutritional source was obtained and any medication used for colic relief was identified. Cases of colic were identified by applying Wessel criteria to recorded data. Chi-square tests were used. From total 512 infants, follow-up was completed for 426 infants. In total, 90 infants (21.77%) satisfied the Wessel criteria for infantile colic. No statistical significance was found between colicky and non-colicky infants according to sex, gestational age at birth, birth weight, type of delivery, and, infant's feeding pattern.

A cohort study recruited mothers in a hospital in S√£o Leopoldo, Brazil, which mainly serves the low-income population. In order to obtain socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioral information, face-to-face interviews with mothers were conducted after birth, and when their infants were 6 and 12 months old. The duration of breastfeeding was investigated at 6 and 12 months, and recorded separately for each month. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory. The multivariate model for predicting the discontinuation of breastfeeding, adjusted Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression were used. Of the 360 participants, 201 (55.8%) discontinued breastfeeding within the first 12 months.

581,Attachment behavior: A validation study in two age groups,"To assess the validity of attachment scores derived from M. Ainsworth and B. Wittig's (1969) ""strange situation,"" 56 1-yr-olds (in whom attachment behavior was well established) and 79 2.5-yr-olds (in whom detachment was underway), accompanied by either the mother, the father, or a brief acquaintance were studied in 2 experiments. Proximity to the adult, duration of play, crying, activity, and the incidence of looks and distance bids were measured. The younger Ss were more secure with their parents: They were more active, played more, cried less, and stood closer to their parents than to an acquaintance. The older Ss accompanied by their parents were less settled in the presence of a stranger than those accompanied by the acquaintance. It is concluded that the concept of attachment seems inadequate for dealing with the differences obtained in this and other research and that its validity should be questioned in older children.

Campylobacter bacteremia is an uncommon condition, usually diagnosed in elderly and immunocompromised patients. Methods. Blood culture isolates and clinical information were collected for patients with diagnoses of Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli bacteremia in Finland from 1998 through 2007. Bacterial species were identified by means of polymerase chain reaction analysis, and minimal inhibitory concentrations for ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, gentamicin, meropenem, and metronidazole were determined with an agar dilution method. Medical records and mortality data within 1 year after the bacteremic episode were reviewed. Results. The study included 76 patients (median age, 46 years), for whom bacterial isolates (C. jejuni in 73, C. coli in 3) and clinical information were available. Most patients (70%) had no significant underlying diseases. The majority (82%) of the isolates were susceptible for all antimicrobial agents tested. However, antimicrobial therapy seemed to have only a limited effect, because no differences could be detected between patients with appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and those with delayed appropriate, inappropriate, or no antimicrobial therapy, either in the duration of hospitalization (median, 4 days for both groups) or in attributable mortality.

These associations may not be consistent, however, among the millions of children living in lower- and middle-income countries. Our objective was to examine child development and growth in young children across socio-economic position in four developing countries. We used cross-sectional surveys, child development assessments, measures of length (LAZ), and home stimulation (Family Care Index) of children in India, Indonesia, Peru, and Senegal. The Extended Ages and Stages Questionnaire (EASQ) was administered to parents of all children ages 3-23 mo in the household (n =8,727), and length measurements were taken for all children 0-23 mo (n = 11,102). Household wealth and maternal education contributed significantly and independently to the variance in EASQ and LAZ scores in all countries, while controlling for child's age and sex, mother's age and marital status, and household size. Being in the fifth wealth quintile in comparison with the first quintile was associated with significantly higher EASQ scores (0.27 to 0.48 of a standardized score) and higher LAZ scores (0.37 to 0.65 of a standardized score) in each country, while controlling for maternal education and covariates. Wealth and education gradients increased over the first two years in most countries for both EASQ and LAZ scores, with larger gradients seen in 16-23-mo-olds than in 0-7mo-olds. Mediation analyses revealed that parental home stimulation activities and LAZ were significant mediating variables and explained up to 50% of the wealth effects on the EASQ.","Fernald, L. C.

Increases in fantasy play across these periods were interpreted as active coping both with the stress of separation and the altered interactions following the arrival of a new sibling. Increases in negative affect, activity level, heart rate, night walkings, and crying characterized the hospital period as one of agitation. Longer periods of deep sleep at this stage were interpreted as conservation withdrawal. Following the mothers' return, decreases were noted in positive affect, activity level, heart rate, and active sleep suggestive of depression.

This study aimed (1) to describe infant sleep-wake behaviors during the 24-h period, day and night, at two weeks, three, and six months, (2) and to explore developmental changes and the role of individual change and stability on infant sleep-wake behaviors from two weeks to six months. Ninety-four primiparous mothers completed measures on infant sleep-wake behaviors at two weeks, three and six months. Significant developmental changes were found on infant sleep-wake behaviors from two weeks to six months. Two-week-old infants sleep 13.3 h, spend 8.7 h awake, awake 6.1 times, have 0.4 h of latency to sleep, and 3.2 h of longest sleep period. Three-month-old infants sleep 13.0 h, spend 9.2 h awake, awake 5.5 times, have 0.4 h of latency to sleep, and 5.2 h of longest sleep period. Six-month-old infants sleep 12.2 h, spend 10.0 h awake, awake 5.2 times, have 0.4 h of latency to sleep, and 5.6 h of longest sleep period.

Design Cross-sectional online survey design. Participants Parents (n¬†=¬†413) of 1- to 10-year-old children. Main Outcome Measures Parental feeding practices and child eating behaviors were measured via the validated Feeding Practices and Structure and Children's Eating Behaviour questionnaires. Analysis Associations between parental feeding practices and children's eating behaviors were tested using¬†hierarchical multivariable linear regression models, adjusted for covariates. Results Feeding practices accounted for 28% and 21% of the variance in food fussiness and enjoyment of food, respectively (P <¬†.001). For all other eating behaviors the amount of variance explained by feeding practices was < 10% (P¬†<¬†.001). Key findings were that more structure and less non-responsive practices were associated with lower food fussiness and higher enjoyment of food. Conclusions and Implications Overall, the findings suggested that mealtime structure and responsive feeding are associated with more desirable eating behaviors. Contrary to predictions, there was no evidence to indicate that these practices are associated with better self-regulation of energy intake. Longitudinal research and intervention studies are needed to confirm the importance of these feeding practices for children's eating behaviors and weight outcomes. ¬© 2016 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior","Finnane, J.

The aim was to determine whether What Were We Thinking (WWWT) a gender-informed, psychoeducational programme for couples and babies can prevent PCMD among primiparous women 6 months postpartum. Design: Cluster-randomised controlled trial. Setting: 48 Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHCs) from 6 Local Government Areas in Melbourne, Australia were allocated randomly to usual care (24) or usual care plus WWWT (24). Participants: English-speaking primiparous women receiving primary care at trial MCHCs were recruited to the intervention (204) and control (196) conditions. Of these, 187 (91.7%) and 177 (90.3%) provided complete data. Intervention: WWWT is a manualised programme comprising primary care from a trained nurse, print materials and a face-to-face seminar. Main outcome measures: Data sources were standardised and study-specific measures collected in blinded computer-assisted telephone interviews at 6 and 26 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome was PCMD assessed by Composite International Diagnostic Interviews and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) Depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder modules. Results: In intention-to-treat analyses the adjusted OR (AOR) of PCMD in the intervention compared to the usual care group was 0.78 (95% CI 0.38 to 1.63, ns), but mild to moderate anxiety symptoms (AOR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.97) and poor self-rated health (AOR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.97) were significantly lower. In a per protocol analysis, comparing the full (three component) intervention and usual care groups, the AOR of PCMD was 0.36, (95% CI 0.14 to 0.95). The WWWT seminar was appraised as salient, comprehensible and useful by >85% participants. No harms were detected.

Universal interventions to prevent postnatal mental disorders in women have had limited success, perhaps because they were insufficiently theorised, not gender-informed and overlooked relevant risk factors. This study aimed to determine whether an innovative brief psycho-educational program for mothers, fathers and first newborns, which addressed salient learning needs about infant behaviour management and adjustment tasks in the intimate partner relationship, prevented postpartum mental health problems in primiparous women. Methods. A before and after controlled study was conducted in primary care in seven local government areas in Victoria, Australia. English-speaking couples with one-week old infants were invited consecutively to participate by the maternal and child health nurse at the universal first home visit. Two groups were recruited and followed sequentially: both completed telephone interviews at four weeks and six months postpartum and received standard health care.

599,Father departure and children's mental health: How does timing matter?,"Father's permanent departure from the household in childhood has the potential to affect child mental health. The event is non-random, and a major limitation in most previous studies is lack of adequate control for unobserved confounders. Using five waves of data spanning ages 3 to 14 from the Millennium Cohort Study, a UK-wide nationally representative longitudinal study, this paper uses fixed effect models to examine the effect of paternal absence on children's mental health (i.e. externalising and internalising problems) in a sample of 6245 children. Heterogeneity of effects are examined by gender and maternal education. A novel aspect is to examine how the timing of departure matters, and to assess whether there are developmental periods that are especially sensitive to paternal departure, and whether effects are temporary or enduring. We find that paternal departure has a negative effect on child mental health, particularly on internalising symptoms. Striking gender differences emerge in examining effects by timing and duration. There are no short-term effects of departure in early childhood, and only weak evidence of females showing an increase in internalising symptoms in the medium-term. Paternal departure in later childhood, on the other hand, is associated with an increase in internalising problems in both males and females, and increased externalising symptoms for males only. We do not find maternal education to be a protective factor. ¬© 2018","Fitzsimons, E. and Villadsen, A.",0,477

602,The evaluation of tailored and web-based information for new fathers,"Background: Information and advice on infant health and development have been shown to be well received by new parents and to lead to more confident and nurturing parenting. However, in spite of the accumulating evidence highlighting the importance of fathers to the well-being of their families, fathers rarely access and utilize 'parenting' information. Tailored information for fathers delivered via email and Internet may provide an alternate route for support for fathers. This study aimed to assess father's readiness to utilize electronic information tailored to father's role. Methods: Two hundred and fifty-three fathers from antenatal classes in two Australian cities were offered email and web-based information on seven topics: baby play, breastfeeding, post-natal depression, father-infant bonding, sex after birth, work-family balance and fussy babies. Of 137 who completed consent forms, a total of 105 fathers selected three topics and 67 fathers provided 149 topic evaluations. Results: Most respondents were from managerial, professional or skilled occupations and had higher educational qualifications than the general population of fathers. The most popular topics were those that related to father-infant interaction (baby games and father-infant bonding), and the least popular were breastfeeding and sex after the birth. Respondents rated the information as satisfactory and most (78%) indicated that it changed their approach to fathering. Although the websites provided were available through the Internet, few fathers had previously accessed them. Conclusions: Information tailored to new father's perspectives provided through email or Internet may increase new fathers' access to useful knowledge and support. Important health topics such as breastfeeding may not currently be perceived as particularly relevant to fathers in the antenatal period. Portals designed to filter existing websites could facilitate the use of parenting information by new fathers. ¬© 2008 The Author Journal compilation ¬© 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Fletcher, R. and Vimpani, G. and Russell, G. and Keatinge, D.",0,480
604,Neonatal NR3C1 methylation and social-emotional development at 6 and 18 months of age,"The variation in childhood social-emotional development within at-risk populations may be attributed in part to epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation (DNAm) that respond to environmental stressors. These mechanisms may partially underlie the degree of vulnerability (and resilience) to negative social-emotional development within adverse psychosocial environments. Extensive research supports an association between maternal adversity and offspring DNAm of the NR3C1 gene, which encodes the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). A gap in knowledge remains regarding the relationship between NR3C1 DNAm, measured in neonatal (1-month of age) buccal cells, and subsequent social-emotional development during infancy and early childhood. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of n = 53 mother-child dyads (n = 30 with developmental outcomes formed the basis of current study) who were enrolled in a home visiting (HV) program. Higher mean DNAm of the NR3C1 exon 1F promoter was significantly associated with lower 6-month Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE) scores‚Äîmore positive infant social-emotional functioning. A similar trend was observed at 18-months of age in a smaller sample (n = 12).

605,The Ontogeny of Taste Perception and Preference Throughout Childhood,"This chapter focuses on the approaches and discoveries that have contributed to the knowledge of human development of the five ""basic"" tastes of sweet, sour, salty, bitter and umami, and the impact they have had on our understanding of the sensory world of children. It begins by providing an overview of the mechanisms underlying taste sensations and their emergence during development. A key question in the ontogeny of taste perception is whether function is present prior to birth. Two approaches have been used to answer this important question: indirect observations of the fetus and direct observations of premature infants. The chapter describes the methodologies used to measure 2- to 16-year-old children's reflex-like behaviors to tastants and the behavioral tasks performed to measure their taste sensitivities and preferences. In conclusion, it is a public health priority to develop standardized psychophysical methods that are appropriate for children of all ages. ¬© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

606,Effective treatment for postpartum depression is not sufficient to improve the developing mother-child relationship,"Maternal depression is prevalent, and puts children at risk. Little evidence addresses whether treatment for maternal depression is sufficient to improve child outcomes. An experiment was conducted testing whether psychotherapeutic treatment for mothers, suffering from major depression in the postpartum period, would result in improved parenting and child outcomes. Participants included depressed women randomly assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy (n = 60) or to a waitlist (n = 60), and a nondepressed comparison group (n = 56). At 6 months, depressed mothers were less responsive to their infants, experienced more parenting stress, and viewed their infants more negatively than did nondepressed mothers. Treatment affected only parenting stress, which improved significantly but was still higher than that for nondepressed mothers. Eighteen months later, treated depressed mothers still rated their children lower in attachment security, higher in behavior problems, and more negative in temperament than nondepressed mothers. Initial response to treatment did not predict reduced risk for poor child outcomes. Early maternal negative perceptions of the child predicted negative temperament and behavior problems 18 months after treatment. Treatment for depression in the postpartum period should target the mother-infant relationship in addition to the mothers' depressive symptoms. ¬© 2007 Cambridge University Press.","Forman, D.

607,Age-related functional feeding: A novel tool to improve the quality of life,"At different stages of life, probiotics can provide health benefits to the consumer. Certain benefits, such as reduction in allergy, are typical for infants. Modulation of immune function and maintenance of the intestinal microbiota are mainly beneficial during infancy/childhood and at old age. Although it may seem that in adulthood, in the prime of one's life, probiotics have fewer benefits to offer, there are still substantial health gains possible, i.e. for lactose intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome and reduction in the risk for antibiotic-associated diarrhea and respiratory tract infections. Similar benefits, but usually with a more pronounced effect, can be observed in the elderly. With the exception of the relief of lactose intolerance symptoms, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has, to date, not approved any health claims for probiotics. While this may seem a contradiction to the content of the chapter, it can be explained by a difference in interpretation of what a health benefit is.

609,Perceptions of vulnerability 3 1/2 years after problems of feeding and crying behavior in early infancy,"The long-term consequences for infants with problems of feeding and crying behavior remain unknown. The purpose of this research was to determine whether such children are later perceived by their parents as vulnerable and more often have behavior problems and have different personalities than children without problems in infancy. The implications of managing such problems by changing milk formulas is explored. Mothers of 379 infants were enrolled in the postpartum period. Information about problems of feeding and crying behavior was obtained at 4 months. Thirty-six percent of the infants had problems and the formula had been changed for 17%. At 3 1/2 years, 320 (84%) mothers completed a questionnaire. Children who had had problems were more often perceived as vulnerable (relative risk [RR] 1.86","Forsyth, B. W. and Canny, P. F.",1,486

Attention was paid to issues of designing a blind study, providing a washout period, and measuring and reproducing the effect. In this randomized, double-blind trial, three changes of formula were made: for each of four 4-day periods, colicky infants alternately received a casein hydrolysate formula (Nutramigen) and a formula containing cow milk. Mothers recorded crying in diaries and indicated which crying episodes they considered to have been caused by colic. Nine infants were started on Nutramigen and eight on the cow milk formula. With the first formula change there was significantly less crying and colic in infants when they were fed Nutramigen than when they were fed cow milk (p<0.01)","Forsyth, B. W. C.",0,487
611,Mothers' Perceptions of Problems of Feeding and Crying Behaviors: A Prospective Study,"During early infancy, problems of crying, colic, spitting, and feeding difficulties often provoke anxiety and lack of self-confidence in parents. We studied prospectively what proportion of mothers felt that their infants had problems of this type and determined risk factors for perceived problems identified in the early postnatal period. The mothers of 189 breast-fed and 184 formula-fed infants completed questionnaires post partum and responded to a follow-up interview at four months. Thirty-five percent of mothers in each group reported that their infants had moderate or severe problems of feeding or crying behavior. Risk factors for perceived problems were identified using stepwise logistic regression analyses. Inquiry about, and early attention to, risk factors may alleviate the parents' concerns and possibly affect the development of these problems. ¬© 1985, American Medical Association.

616,Treatment of infant sleep disturbance by trimeprazine in combination with extinction,"Evaluated the effects of combining extinction (withdrawal of parental attention) and sedative medication (trimeprazine tartrate), prescribed in a reducing dose over the 1st 10 days of extinction. 35 children (aged 7‚Äì27 mo) participated in the study: 13 received extinction, 12 received extinction plus placebo, and 10 received extinction plus trimeprazine. The parents of Ss were interviewed with the Daily Sleep Diary, the Flint Infant Security Scale, and the A-State Scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory during baseline, on Day 3 of intervention, during the 1st wk of maintenance, and at follow-up. All Ss reduced their sleep disturbance to low levels, the extinction and placebo groups declining slowly, the medication group abruptly. These gains were maintained at follow-up. Measures of infant security and maternal anxiety showed improvements with treatment.

618,Prenatal VOC exposure and redecoration are related to wheezing in early infancy,"Redecoration of dwellings is a common behavior of expecting parents. Former studies gave evidence that early childhood exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOC) resulting from renovation activities may increase the risk for wheeze in infants. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of prenatal exposure on early wheeze and to identify sensitive time windows. Within the LINA birth cohort study data on renovation activities and respiratory outcomes were assessed via questionnaires during pregnancy and at children's age of one. At both timepoints, also indoor VOC concentrations were measured. The associations were studied by logistic regression analysis. Floor covering during pregnancy contributed to an increased risk for physician treated wheeze (adjusted odds ratio OR. = 5.20, 95% confidence interval 1.8-15.2) during the first 12. months after birth in particular in children with an atopic predisposition. Thereby, wall-to-wall-carpets, PVC material, and laminate were the flooring materials which showed the strongest adverse associations. Floor covering was associated with enhanced concentrations of VOCs in the apartments. For the VOCs styrene, ethylbenzene, octane, 1-butanol, tridecane, and o-xylene, a significant association was found to the occurrence of wheezing symptoms. In contrast to pregnancy, exposure during the first 12. months after birth showed less detrimental associations. Only the association between wheezing and styrene as well as between wheezing and PVC flooring remained significant for exposure after birth. Redecoration during pregnancy, especially changing floor materials, increases the risk for respiratory diseases in early childhood and should therefore be avoided at least in families with a history of atopic diseases. ¬© 2013 .","Franck, U. and Weller, A. and R√∂der, S.

Using videorecordings, cries were classified according to 3 categories that were functionally distinguishable from a communicative viewpoint. Spectrographic analysis showed that the 3 functional categories differed with respect to different manners of phonation, although the relation between each category and the specific type of phonation was determined by individual preference. A relation was found between the duration of vocalization and the manner of phonation. It is suggested that differences in the functional meaning of cries are marked by some nonsegmental regularities.

622,Cartoons to improve young children's cooperation with inhaled corticosteroids: A preliminary study,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate if animated cartoons could increase the cooperation of young children with asthma during the delivery of their inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). METHODS: Subjects were children aged 6-47 months having a physician diagnosis of asthma, who required an ICS therapy delivered through a pMDI/spacer twice a day for at least 2 months. Families who reported on a questionnaire that their child was frequently crying or moving during treatment delivery were asked to participate in a prospective, cross-over, randomized study. After a first week of run-in, children watched alternatively, during the delivery of ICS, either an animated cartoon for 7 days and a black screen video for another 7 days. The main outcome was the median percentage of time of non-cooperation, defined by the length of time the child was crying and/or moving divided by the length of time required for delivering ICS. RESULTS: Parents of 50 children out of 113 (44%) reported that their child was frequently crying or moving during treatment delivery. Among these 50 children, 11 (22%) completed the study. The median percentages of time of non-cooperation (IQR 1-3) were 0% (0-3) and 56% (40-97) during the distraction and control periods, respectively, in the first group, and 100% (98-100) and 0% (0-5) during the control and distraction periods, respectively, in the second group. Animated cartoons increased cooperation up to 97% (55-100%) (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Bad cooperation among young children with asthma during the delivery of their treatment can be dramatically improved by the use of animated cartoons.","Fr√©mont, A. and Abou Taam, R. and Wanin, S. and Lebras, M.

623,Infant mortality of professional sports clubs: An organizational ecology perspective,"Due to their limited financial resources winning the national championship or qualifying for an international cup competition is not a viable option formost small market clubs in any of the European professional team sports leagues, such as soccer, ice hockey, basketball or handball. However, since a particularly poor performance is usually punished by relegation and since being relegated to the respective second division is associated with a dramatic decline in revenues, avoiding relegation is a target in itself. Using data from seven different professional team sports leagues in four different countries we estimate various parametric and semi-parametric regression models to identify the determinants of the clubs' length of stay in their respective first division. In line with the organizational ecology literature we find that club experience, previous club performance (number of previous championship titles and number of previous relegations) and market size (average attendance) affect survival in a statistically significant and economically relevant sense. Perhaps surprisingly, founding conditions seem to be irrelevant for a club's length of stay in its respective first division.","Frick, B. and Wallbrecht, B.",0,496

Measures included a revised infant temperament questionnaire (W. B. Carey, 1970), child-rearing attitudes, psychophysiological responses to an unfamiliar infant's crying pre- and postdelivery, psychophysiological responses to the mother's own infant's crying, and assessments of infant‚Äìmother attachment. Maternal ratings of infant temperament at 4 mo were significantly related not only to concurrent cry responsiveness but also to cry responsiveness and child-rearing attitudes predelivery, as well as to the quality of attachment at 1 yr. A differential response pattern of mothers of ""easy"" and of ""difficult"" infants, that affects the developing infant‚Äìmother bond, may in part originate in maternal dispositions existing prior to parenthood.

626,Longitudinal associations between low morning cortisol in infancy and anger dysregulation in early childhood in a CPS-referred sample,"Children who experience early adversity are at increased risk for developing psychopathology, and dysfunction of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is a possible mechanism conferring this risk. This study sought to characterize the association between morning cortisol during different developmental periods and deficits in children's emotion regulation, a core feature of many psychological disorders. Morning cortisol was collected at two time points (i.e., during infancy, M = 13.0 months old, and during early childhood, M = 36.8 months old) from 120 children with histories of child protective services (CPS) involvement. Children completed a lab visit during early childhood (M = 38.6 months old) that involved an observational measure of anger regulation. Results showed that low morning cortisol during infancy, but not early childhood, predicted increased anger dysregulation during early childhood. These results highlight the importance of developmental timing in assessing the effects of HPA axis functioning and suggest that low cortisol during infancy is a risk factor for later emotion regulation difficulties. ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Frost, A. and Jelinek, C. and Bernard, K. and Lind, T. and Dozier, M.",0,499
628,Noisy but effective: crying across the first 3 months of life,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the developmental occurrence of subharmonic (SH) and noise (N) phenomena and to quantify their extent in the spontaneous cries of healthy infants across the first 3¬†months. STUDY DESIGN: Populational prospective study. PARTICIPANTS: Spontaneous elicited cries from 20 infants (10 male) were repeatedly recorded across the first 3¬†months of life. METHODS: Frequency spectra and waveforms were used to identify the occurrence of SH and N and to measure the percentage of their combined occurrence in overall monthly crying behavior (expressed as a quantitative noise index [NI]). RESULTS: SH and N episodes were prevalent in the cries of young infants during the first 2¬†months, being present in more than 50% of the recorded cries. A developmental trend was evident in NI with a significant decrease across the 3-month period. A corresponding significant increase in mean duration of single cries was observed during the same period. CONCLUSIONS: SH and phonatory noise are regularly occurring phenomena in healthy infant crying because of the characteristics of pediatric larynx anatomy and neurophysiological control mechanisms underlying cry production. The reduction in NI appears to correspond with the development of an infant's crying complexity. The utility of NI as a metric of cry phonatory behavior should next be validated on infant groups with known or suspected health problems.","Fuamenya, N. A. and Robb, M. P. and Wermke, K.",0,500

633,Characteristics that distinguish abusive from nonabusive head trauma among young children who underwent head computed tomography in Japan,"OBJECTIVE. Distinguishing abusive head trauma in young children from other diseases by symptoms is difficult in practice. Comparisons between abusive and nonabusive head trauma in young children in Japan, where computed tomography is widely and easily available, might contribute to identifying markers of abusive head trauma that differ from that in Western countries. The objective of this study was to compare the characteristics of abusive and nonabusive head trauma in young children in Japan. METHODS. A comparative case series study involving a retrospective medical chart and social work record review of children who were aged 0 to 2 years, visited the National Center for Child Health and Development (Tokyo, Japan) from March 1, 2002, to December 31, 2005, and underwent computed tomography scanning because of suspected intracranial injury was performed. Patients (N = 260) were identified and classified as having either abusive or nonabusive head trauma on the basis of the published definition. Demographic and perinatal characteristics, injury history, clinical presentation, and outcomes were compared by using x2 and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS. Patients with abusive head trauma were significantly younger than patients with nonabusive head trauma and had a peak at -2 to 4 and 7 to 9 months. Patients with abusive head trauma more likely presented no injury history by the caregiver, neurologic symptoms (unconsciousness, seizure, paralysis), subdural hemorrhage, and retinal hemorrhages. Although patients with abusive head trauma had severe clinical outcomes, only 32% of them were separated from the caregiver by social welfare services.CONCLUSIONS. This study highlights the several clinical markers to detect abusive head trauma at a medical visit, including an absence of injury history, neurologic symptoms, subdural hemorrhage, and retinal hemorrhage. These markers can be used to detect abusive head trauma cases by physicians and social welfare workers to protect children from additional abuse. ¬© 2008 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.","Fujiwara, T. and Okuyama, M. and Miyasaka, M.",0,502

Material hardships, defined as inability to meet basic needs, are important prenatal stressors. Our objective was to determine the associations between prenatal material hardships and infant temperament at 10 months. Methods: This was a longitudinal study of mother-infant pairs in a randomized controlled trial of a primary care-based early obesity prevention program (Starting Early). Independent variables representing material hardship were: housing disrepair, food insecurity, difficulty paying bills, and neighborhood stress (neighborhood safety). Dependent variables representing infant temperament were assessed using questions from 3 subscales of the Infant Behavior Questionnaire: orienting/regulatory capacity, negative affect, and surgency/extraversion. We used linear regression to investigate associations between individual and cumulative hardships and each temperament domain, adjusting for confounders, and testing for depression as a moderator. Results: Four hundred twelve mother-infant pairs completed 10-month assessments. Thirty-two percent reported food insecurity, 26% difficulty paying bills, 35% housing disrepair, and 9% neighborhood stress.

638,Temporal Association Between Reflux-like Behaviors and Gastroesophageal Reflux in Preterm and Term Infants,"OBJECTIVES: Multichannel intraluminal impedance studies (MII-pH) have become the criterion standard for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Several clinical signs and symptoms that are attributed to GER during infancy may not be related to true reflux. Our objective was to correlate the observed reflux-like behaviors to reflux events on MII-pH studies. METHODS: This is a retrospective study on infants being evaluated for GER with MII. During the MII-pH study, the infants were observed for clinical behaviors. Symptom Index (SI), symptom sensitivity index (SSI), and symptom association probability were used to correlate symptoms with reflux events. RESULTS: Of 58 infants (40 preterm, 18 term) included in the study, only 6 infants (10%) had an abnormal MII-pH study. Irritability (32 infants), bradycardia (20), and desaturation (18) were the common signs and symptoms. A total of 2142 (755 acidic and 1386 nonacidic) reflux episodes and 953 clinical reflux behaviors were recorded. The incidence and pattern of GER was similar in preterm and term infants. There was no significant difference in GER episodes and acid exposure in preterm infants fed orally or via nasogastric tube. The symptom association probability was abnormal in only 6 (19%), 1 (5%), and 5 (28%) infants with irritability, bradycardia, and desaturation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of GER as detected by MII-pH was low (10%) in symptomatic preterm and term infants. The incidence and pattern of GER was similar in preterm and term infants. The majority of suspected clinical reflux behaviors did not correlate with reflux events.","Funderburk, A. and Nawab, U. and Abraham, S. and DiPalma, J. and Epstein, M. and Aldridge, H. and Aghai, Z.

639,Consulting on feeding and sleeping problems in child health care: What is at the bottom of advice to parents?,"The aim of this study was to investigate and interpret ideas inherent in sleep and diet consultations concerning infants in Swedish child health services. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews of professionals employed in these services. A qualitative method with a phenomenological approach was applied to analyse the data. The results indicate that professionals have underlying conceptions. They considered that when parents force food on their child, this is a violation of the child's integrity. This view is based on the idea that such actions restrict the child's right to selfdetermination. In the participants' opinions, when the child is forced to sleep well, this is not regarded as a violation of the child's integrity, but is perceived as support of the child's autonomy. An underlying theoretical view may be that parents' time can be saved if the child becomes independent of the parents at as early an age as possible. ¬© 2005 SAGE Publications London, Thousand Oaks, CA and New Delhi.","Funkquist, E.

640,Severe maternal morbidity and breastfeeding outcomes in the early post-natal period: a prospective cohort study from one English maternity unit,"Previous research has identified potential issues of establishing and maintaining breastfeeding among women who experience severe maternal morbidity associated with pregnancy and birth, but evidence in the UK maternity population was scarce. We explored the association between severe maternal morbidity and breastfeeding outcomes (uptake and prevalence of partial and exclusive breastfeeding) at 6 to 8 weeks post-partum in a UK sample. Data on breastfeeding outcomes were obtained from a large cohort study of women who gave birth in one maternity unit in England to assess the impact of women's experiences of severe maternal morbidity (defined as major obstetric haemorrhage, severe hypertensive disorder or high dependency unit/intensive care unit admission) on their post-natal health and other important outcomes including infant feeding. Results indicated that among women who responded (n = 1824, response rate = 53%), there were no statistically significant differences in breastfeeding outcomes between women who did or did not experience severe morbidity, except for women with severe hypertensive disorder who were less likely to breastfeed either partially or exclusively at 6 to 8 weeks post-partum. Rather, breastfeeding outcomes were related to multi-dimensional factors including sociodemographic (age, ethnicity, living arrangement), other pregnancy outcomes (neonatal intensive care unit admission, mode of birth, women's perceived control during birth) and post-natal psychological factors (depressive symptoms). Women who experience severe maternal morbidity can be reassured that establishing successful breastfeeding can be achieved. More studies are required to understand what support is best for women who have complex health/social needs to establish breastfeeding. ¬© 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Furuta, M. and Sandall, J. and Cooper, D. and Bick, D.",0,508

Erotic target identity inversions (ETII) and childhood maltreatment have been hypothesized to cause regressive interests. To evaluate these two etiological hypotheses, we surveyed the online adult baby/diaper lover community. Data from 1904 cis-gender men revealed a prevalence of pedophilic interests comparable with the general male population, arguing against ETIIs as common in paraphilic infantilism. In contrast, self-reported childhood neglect and abuse were highly prevalent, suggesting that infantilism might be correlated with childhood maltreatment.

646,"Regulation during the second year: Executive function and emotion regulation links to joint attention, temperament, and social vulnerability in a Latin American sample","Although a growing body of work has established developing regulatory abilities during the second year of life, more work is needed to better understand factors that influence this emerging control. The purpose of the present study was to examine regulation capacities in executive functions (i.e., EF or cognitive control) and emotion regulation (i.e., ER or control focused on modulating negative and sustaining positive emotions) in a Latin American sample, with a focus on how joint attention, social vulnerability, and temperament contribute to performance. Sixty Latin American dyads of mothers and children aged 18 to 24 months completed several EF tasks, a Still-Face Paradigm (SFP) to examine ER (Weinberg et al., 2008), and the Early Social Communication Scale to measure joint attention (Mundy et al., 2003). Parents completed the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire Very Short Form to measure temperament (ECBQ-VS, Putnam et al., 2010) and the Social Economic Level Scale (SES) from INDEC (2000). Results revealed the typical responses expected for toddlers of this age in these EF tasks and in the SFP. Also, we found associations between EF and ER and between non-verbal communication related to monitoring infants' attention to objects (i.e., responding to joint attention) and initiation of pointing (e.g., pointing and showing of an object while the child alternates his gaze to an adult) with EF. Regarding social factors, family differences and type of housing contribute to regulation. For temperament, effortful control was associated with both regulatory capacities. Finally, only age predicted EF. These results suggest that many patterns regarding the development of these abilities are duplicated in the first months of life in a Latin American sample while further highlighting the importance of considering how the environment and the individual characteristics of infants may associate to these regulatory abilities, which is particularly relevant to developing public policies to promote their optimal development. ¬© 2019 Gago Galvagno, De Grandis, Clerici, Mustaca, Miller and Elgier.","Gago Galvagno, L.

METHOD: A prospective case-control study recruited 27 pregnant women taking antidepressant medication and 27 matched controls who were not taking antidepressant medication in pregnancy. Of the 27 women taking medication, 25 remained on medication in the third trimester and, of these, 23 women had complete data available. In pregnancy and after delivery women were assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II and a purpose-designed questionnaire. After delivery mothers were asked a set of nine questions pertaining to symptoms of discontinuation in their newborn and questions about pregnancy and delivery complications. RESULTS: There was an increased risk of discontinuation symptoms in neonates exposed to antidepressant medication in late pregnancy and an association with higher dose medication. The study group were found to be significantly more likely to display behaviour such as crying, jitteriness, tremor, feeding, reflux and sneezing and sleep for <3 h after a feed. They also had significantly higher rates of jaundice and admissions to the special care nursery. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy is associated with a range of symptoms in the neonate that are consistent with the effects of exposure to antidepressants in late pregnancy. The clusters of symptoms most highly correlated are the gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms. These finding helps to identify the common symptoms associated with a neonatal serotonin discontinuation syndrome.","Galbally, M. and Lewis, A. J. and Lum, J. and Buist, A.",0,512

Design Sleep intervention within a randomised controlled trial for the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI) study. Participants 802 families were randomly allocated to one of four groups: usual care (control), sleep intervention (sleep), food, activity and breastfeeding intervention (FAB), and combined group receiving both interventions (combination). Interventions All groups received standard Well Child care. The sleep intervention groups (sleep and combination) received an antenatal group education session (all mothers and most partners) emphasising infant self-settling and safe sleeping, and a home visit at 3 weeks reinforcing the antenatal sleep education. FAB and combination groups received four contacts providing education and support on breast feeding, food and activity up to 4 months postpartum. Outcome measures Here we report secondary sleep outcomes from the POI study: the prevalence of parent-reported infant sleep problems and night waking, and differences in sleep duration. Additional outcomes reported include differences in infant self-settling, safe sleep practices, and maternal and partner reports of their own sleep, fatigue and depression symptoms. Results Linear or mixed linear regression models found no significant intervention effects on sleep outcomes, with 19.1% of mothers and 16.6% of partners reporting their infant's sleep a problem at 6 months. Actigraphy estimated the number of night wakings to be significantly reduced (8%) and the duration of daytime sleep increased (6 min) in those groups receiving the sleep intervention compared with those who did not. However, these small differences were not clinically significant and not observed in 24 hours infant sleep diary data. No other differences were observed. Conclusion A strategy delivering infant sleep education antenatally and at 3 weeks postpartum was not effective in preventing the development of parent-reported infant sleep problems. ¬© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

650,"Postpartum maternal mood, feeding practices, and infant temperament in Barbados","Maternal mood, infant feeding practices, and infant temperament, using the Carey-R scales, were assessed in 226 healthy, well-nourished Barbadian mothers and their infants during the first 6 months of life. Maternal moods were assessed by self-report using the Zung depression and anxiety scales and a morale scale. Even after correcting for background variables, maternal depression and anxiety ratings and reports of despair at 6 months postpartum were significantly associated with infant temperament ratings at 6 months, using the original Carey-R scales, with factors derived from principal components analysis of the Carey items, and with summary difficulty scores. Maternal depressive symptoms were associated with decreased infant adaptability, reduced approach, negative mood and an increased sensory threshold. Infants of depressed and anxious mothers were more resistant to change and preferred constancy. These significant relationships were linear across the range of maternal mood scores and were not limited to diagnosed cases of depression or anxiety. In contrast, feeding practices were not significantly correlated with infant temperament, although infant difficulty on the temperament scales was associated with an increase in difficult feeding behaviors and with fathers' involvement in the feeding of their infants. We conclude that interventions focused on improving maternal mood in the postpartum period are likely to impact positively upon maternal perceptions of their infants, with implications for improving child behavioral development and health in this underserved population. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Inc.

651,Socioeconomic position and picky eating behavior predict disparate weight trajectories in infancy,"Infant weight gain has long-term implications for the establishment of overall health. We examined whether socioeconomic position (SEP), the use of pressure as a feeding practice, and picky eating relate to changes infant in weight-for-length (WFL). A modified developmental design was used to examine whether current levels of child picky eating, parental use of pressure, and SEP were associated with changes in WFL during infancy. Health providers distributed survey packets during routine well-child visits made in the homes of families with young children in New Zealand (n = 193). Primary caregivers of young children provided their child's current level of picky eating, their use of pressure, and their SEP. They also reported their child's professionally-measured WFL from birth, 8, 15, and 21 months of age. A multi-level modeling analysis yielded an interaction between SEP and picky eating in predicting infant weight change over time. Children who had a low SEP and were not picky eaters were on the highest WFL trajectory and children who had a low SEP and were picky eaters were lowest on the WFL trajectory. A main effect revealed that higher levels of parental pressure predicted lower WFL in infants at each age, but did not interact with SEP or picky eating. Findings from this study indicate that the combination of eating behavior and SEP are associated with differential infant growth patterns. These results suggest that eating behavior and SEP should be included in the development of interventions designed to achieve healthy weight during childhood. ¬© 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

652,No more tears? Maternal involvement during the newborn screening examination,"BACKGROUND: Babies often show signs of discomfort and distress by crying during the neonatal screening examination (NSE). The authors hypothesized that supporting the baby with maternal participation may reduce infant crying during NSE. The objective of this study was to document incidental infant crying during NSE, before and after training residents, on maternal involvement and infant comfort techniques to help. METHODS: A total of 20 NSEs of normal newborn babies by pediatric residents were observed (video-recorded) following informed consent of the doctor and the baby's mother. The examining doctors were then taught how to use maternal participation and developmental care (MPDC) comfort techniques to support the baby during NSE. Mothers were shown how to focus on their baby's needs by supporting the baby's head (preventing atonic neck reflexes) and, if necessary, providing nonnutritive sucking to the baby and an encouraging, repetitive low-tone voices to sooth the baby. A further 14 NSEs on different babies were video-recorded using these techniques. The video recordings were analyzed by independent observers for total length of crying and duration of crying during specific components of the NSE. Mothers in both groups were given a questionnaire to assess their opinions of the NSE. RESULTS: The median length of crying was significantly longer in the pre-MPDC group (93.5 seconds","Ganda, A.

Analyses revealed interactions for methylation markers and SSRI exposure variables. A significant interaction between SSRI exposure and mean SLC6A4 methylation at CpG 9,10 and separately for PC1 emerged, controlling for multiple birth/medical and background covariates (e.g., Apgar scores, maternal education). Increased neonatal methylation status was associated with increased soothability changes from 3 to 6 months among infants prenatally exposed to SSRIs.","Gartstein, M. A. and Hookenson, K.

Examples include measurements collected from wearable technology (e.g., accelerometers), psychophysiological measures, coded observations, social media behaviors, and daily diary data. When numerous observations are available for each individual, the data fall under the class of time series data and can be examined from within a dynamic systems perspective. We provide a broad overview of current analytic methods for quantifying relations among dyads using this data type. The techniques include those from within a linear modeling framework, approaches that include a measurement model, and methods for examining cyclical relations. We also discuss some special topics, such as methods that allow for models to shift across time and that accommodate heterogeneity across individuals. Finally, methods that account for similar shapes of nonlinear curves across time are described. From this breadth of options, we hope to help guide practitioners, clinicians, and researchers in choosing the optimal method for their data and line of questions. To further aid in this choice, we indicate programs available for each technique. Example dyads presented here range from mother‚Äìinfant, patient‚Äìcaretaker, and husband‚Äìwife","Gates, K.

The disease is notifiable in Denmark. This paper reviews the results of the Danish surveillance of invasive listeriosis from 1994 to 2003, excluding maternofetal cases. In total, 299 invasive cases of listeriosis were reported. Two-thirds of the cases were caused by isolates of serogroup 1/2, and one-third by serogroup 4. Most (70%) cases had conditions known to predispose to listeriosis. More patients with BS infection were predisposed because of concurrent underlying illness than were patients with CNS infection. Half of the patients were aged > 70 years, and 21% died of the disease. There was no change in the case fatality rate (CFR) during the 10-year period. The CFR was identical for men and women. BS and CNS infection caused the same incidence of mortality, but no mortality was observed in patients with focal infections at normally sterile body sites. In a multivariate analysis, isolates belonging to serogroup 4 were associated with a higher CFR than were isolates of serogroup 1/2. In patients aged < 70 years, underlying conditions predisposing to disease were related strongly to mortality, which was not the case in patients aged > 70 years.

The aim of this paper was to examine the relationship between depressive symptoms and fatigue over the course of the first 4¬†years postpartum, in particular focusing on the extent to which fatigue at earlier time points predicted later depressive symptoms and vice versa. Data from over 1000 women participating in a longitudinal study of Australian women‚Äôs physical and psychological health and recovery after childbirth were used.

683,"Socioeconomic status, infant feeding practices and early childhood obesity","Summary What is already known about this subject Children from low socioeconomic households are at greater risk of obesity. Children predominantly breastfed have a reduced risk of early childhood obesity. Yet, it is not known how feeding patterns mediate the relationship between social class and obesity. What this study adds Based on a nationally representative, longitudinal study of early childhood, this study finds that healthy infant feeding practices, including predominant breastfeeding, mediates the negative association between social class and obesity at 24 months. Background Children from low socioeconomic households are at greater risk of obesity. As breastfeeding can protect against child obesity, disadvantaged infants are less likely to breastfeed relative to more advantaged children. Whether infant feeding patterns, as well as other maternal characteristics mediate the association between social class and obesity has not been established in available research. Objectives Examine the impact of infant feeding practices on child obesity and identify the mechanisms that link socioeconomic status (SES) with child obesity. Methods Based on a nationally representative longitudinal survey (ECLS-B) of early childhood (n = 8030), we examine how breastfeeding practices, the early introduction of solid foods and putting an infant to bed with a bottle mediate the relationship between social class and early childhood obesity relative to the mediating influence of other maternal characteristics (BMI, age at birth, smoking, depression and daycare use). Results Infants predominantly fed formula for the first 6 months were about 2.5 times more likely to be obese at 24 months of age relative to infants predominantly fed breast milk. The early introduction of solid foods (< 4 months) and putting the child to bed with a bottle also increased the likelihood of obesity. Unhealthy infant feeding practices were the primary mechanism mediating the relationship between SES and early childhood obesity. Results are consistent across measures of child obesity although the effect size of infant feeding practices varies. Conclusions The encouragement and support of breastfeeding and other healthy feeding practices are especially important for low socioeconomic children who are at increased risk of early childhood obesity. Targeting socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers for breastfeeding support and for infant-led feeding strategies may reduce the negative association between SES and child obesity. The implications are discussed in terms of policy and practice. ¬© 2013 The Authors. Pediatric Obesity ¬© 2013 International Association for the Study of Obesity.","Gibbs, B. G. and Forste, R.",0,538
684,"Breastfeeding, Parenting, and Infant Attachment Behaviors","Objectives Infants and toddlers need secure attachments in order to develop the social competence required to successfully navigate later peer and adult relationships. Breastfeeding is a parenting factor that has been associated with child emotional development‚Äîspecifically the attachment between children and their mothers. Yet, this link may simply be the result of other parenting behaviors that are associated with breastfeeding. Thus, our objective is to examine whether the link between infant attachment behaviors and breastfeeding endures when accounting for a broad array of in-depth measures of parenting. Methods We use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study of children from 9¬†months to 2¬†years of age collected by the National Center for Education Statistics. Using Ordinary Least Squares regression, data analyses examine the association between the Toddler Attachment Sort-45 (TAS-45) measures of toddler-parent attachment (infant attachment security and temperamental dependency) and breastfeeding practices. We also examine individual items of the TAS-45 to isolate specific attachment behaviors that have the strongest associations with breastfeeding. Results We find an enduring link between children who are predominantly breastfed for six or more months and infant attachment security. However, we find no evidence that breastfeeding is linked to a child‚Äôs temperamental dependency. Of the nine items used to examine infant attachment behaviors, we find that breastfed children are rated as having slightly higher scores on two measures (‚Äúwarm and cuddly,‚Äù ‚Äúcooperative‚Äù) and lower scores on one measure (‚Äúdemanding/angry‚Äù). Conclusions for Practice Breastfeeding has an important link to the child‚Äôs use of their caregiver as a secure base for exploration and a place of comfort when distressed (infant attachment security). Yet, breastfeeding does not appear to reduce a child‚Äôs temperamental dependency or level of clinginess as measured by how demanding, fussy or distressed the child becomes when separated. ¬© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Gibbs, B.

689,The Association of Bifidobacterium breve BR03 and B632 is Effective to Prevent Colics in Bottle-fed Infants,"Goals: To assess the effectiveness of Bifidobacterium breve B632 and BR03 association in the reduction of infants crying over time. The second endpoint was to observe the effect of the same strains on daily evacuations and on the number of regurgitations and vomits. Background: Infant colics represent a clinical condition in childhood, characterized by an uncontrollable crying that occurs without any apparent organic cause. An altered intestinal microbiota composition in the very first months may induce intestinal colics in infants. Thus far, no treatment is really effective for this problem, but recent literature shows an increasing attention toward probiotics. Study: A total of 83 subjects were enrolled, 60 breastfed infants and 23 bottle-fed infants. Sixty of them carried out the study: 29 infants were given probiotics, whereas 31 placebo. During the 90 days of the study, parents were asked to give 5 drops of active product (108 viable cells/strain) or placebo and to daily take note of: minutes of crying, number, color, and consistency of evacuations, and number of regurgitations or vomits. Results: No significant differences were detected in the infants treated with probiotics, compared with placebo group (P=0.75). The analysis of the 3 months of treatment demonstrated that during the third month, the probiotic group cried 12.14 minutes on average and the placebo cried 46.65 minutes. This difference is statistically significant (P=0.016). Conclusions: The evidence of the usefulness of some probiotic strains in the treatment and prevention of infant colics is growing, and therefore their use in clinical practice is spreading.

691,Increasing parenting self-efficacy: The Fussy Baby Network¬Æ intervention,"High levels of infant crying place families at risk for disrupted relationships, parenting stress, and even for child maltreatment. We conducted an evaluation of the Fussy Baby Network¬Æ (FBN), a program supporting families struggling with infant crying and related concerns. The study contrasted 29 families who sought help from FBN with 27 families with excessively crying infants who did not seek services. Researchers measured parenting self-efficacy, depression, and stress in each group before and after the intervention. Results from hierarchical multiple regression analysis indicated greater improvements over time in parenting self-efficacy for parents receiving FBN services. Furthermore, the greater improvements in parenting self-efficacy in the intervention group were not directly attributable to reductions in infant crying. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the FBN approach may be effective at boosting the confidence of parents struggling with caring for their infants. Future research with larger samples with baseline equivalence and stronger research designs should explore this intervention further. This study also suggests that interventions for families with excessively crying infants should move beyond the focus of reducing infant crying to a broader strategy of supporting parents and strengthening relationships between parents and their infants to build parenting capacity. ¬© 2020 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health","Gilkerson, L. and Burkhardt, T. and Katch, L.

692,"Disease presentation in relation to infection foci for non-pregnancy- associated human listeriosis in England and Wales, 2001 to 2007","Listeriosis is a rare but severe food-borne disease, affecting unborn or newly delivered infants, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. The epidemiology of listeriosis in England and Wales changed between 2001 and 2007, with more patients ‚â•60 years old presenting with bacteremia (but without central nervous system [CNS] involvement). In order to explain this increase and understand the altered disease presentation, clinical, microbiological, and seasonal data on bacteremic cases of Listeria monocytogenes infection identified through national surveillance were compared with those for patients with CNS infections. Logistic regression analysis was applied while controlling for age. Bacteremic patients, who presented more frequently with gastrointestinal symptoms, were more likely to have underlying medical conditions than CNS patients. This was most marked in patients with malignancies, particularly digestive organ malignancies. Treatment to reduce stomach acid secretion modified the effect of nonmalignant underlying conditions on outcome, i.e., patients with an underlying condition who were not taking acid-suppressing medication were equally likely to have a bacteremic or a CNS infection. However, this type of therapy did not modify the effect of malignancies on the likelihood of having a bacteremic or a CNS infection. The increase in the incidence of human listeriosis among patients ‚â•60 years old in England and Wales between 2001 and 2007 appears to have occurred in those with cancer or other conditions whose treatment included acid-suppressing medication. Therefore, this vulnerable patient group needs specific dietary advice on avoiding risk factors for listeriosis. Copyright ¬© 2009, American Society for Microbiology.

693,Feeding practices of infants through the first year of life in Italy,"Aim: To investigate infant feeding practices through the first year of life in Italy, and to identify factors associated with the duration of breastfeeding and early introduction of solid foods. Methods: Structured phone interviews on feeding practices were conducted with 2450 Italian-speaking mothers randomly selected among women who delivered a healthy-term singleton infant in November 1999 in Italy. Interviews were performed 30 d after delivery and when the infants were aged 3, 6, 9 and 12 mo. Type of breastfeeding was classified according to the WHO criteria. Results: Breastfeeding started in 91.1% of infants. At the age of 6 and 12 mo, respectively, 46.8% and 11.8% of the infants was still breastfed, 68.4% and 27.7% received formula, and 18.3% and 65.2% were given cow's milk. Solids were introduced at the mean age of 4.3 mo (range 1.6-6.5 mo). Introduction of solids occurred before age 3 and 4 mo in 5.6% and 34.2% of infants, respectively. The first solids introduced were fruit (73.1%) and cereals (63.9%). The main factors (negatively) associated with the duration of breastfeeding were pacifier use (p < 0.0001), early introduction of formula (p < 0.0001), lower mother's age (p < 0.01) and early introduction of solids (p = 0.05). Factors (negatively) associated with the introduction of solids foods before the age of 3 mo were mother not having breastfed (p < 0.01), early introduction of formula (p < 0.01), lower infant bodyweight at the age of 1 mo (p = 0.05) and mother smoking (p = 0.05). Conclusion: The duration of breastfeeding in Italy is still inadequate, as well as compliance with international recommendations for timing of introduction of complementary foods. National guidelines, public messages and educational campaigns should be promoted in Italy.","Giovannini, M. and Riva, E. and Banderali, G. and Scaglioni, S. and Veehof, S. H.

694,Temporal changes of human breast milk lipids of chinese mothers,"Fatty acids (FA), phospholipids (PL), and gangliosides (GD) play a central role in infant growth, immune and inflammatory responses. The aim of this study was to determine FA, PL, and GD compositional changes in human milk (HM) during lactation in a large group of Chinese lactating mothers (540 volunteers) residing in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Suzhou. HM samples were collected after full expression from one breast and while the baby was fed on the other breast. FA were assessed by direct methylation followed by gas chromatography (GC) analysis. PL and GD were extracted using chloroform and methanol. A methodology employing liquid chromatography coupled with an evaporative light scattering detector (ELSD) and with time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry was used to quantify PL and GD classes in HM, respectively. Saturated FA (SFA), mono-unsaturated FA (MUFA), and PL content decreased during lactation, while polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) and GD content increased. Among different cities, over the lactation time, HM from Beijing showed the highest SFA content, HM from Guangzhou the highest MUFA content and HM from Suzhou the highest n-3PUFA content. The highest total PL and GD contents were observed in HM from Suzhou. In order to investigate the influence of the diet on maternal milk composition, a careful analyses of dietary habits of these population needs to be performed in the future. ¬© 2016 by the authors","Giuffrida, F. and Cruz-Hernandez, C. and Bertschy, E. and Fontannaz, P. and Elmelegy, I.

695,Involvement of maternal grandmother and teenage mother in intervention to reduce pacifier use: a randomized clinical trial,"Objective: To assess the impact of an intervention for teenage mothers with the involvement of maternal grandmothers on the prevalence of pacifier use in the first six months of life. Methods: This randomized clinical trial involved 323 teenage mothers, allocated to four groups: intervention with teenagers only, intervention with teenagers and their mothers, and respective controls. Six breastfeeding counseling sessions, including the recommendation to avoid the use of a pacifier, were delivered at the maternity ward and subsequently at the teenagers‚Äô homes, at seven, 15, 30, 60, and 120 days postpartum. Data on infant feeding and pacifier use were collected monthly by interviewers blinded to group allocation. The impact of the intervention was measured by comparing survival curves for pacifier use in the first six months of life and mean time to pacifier introduction. Results: The intervention had a significant impact on reducing pacifier use only in the group in which grandmothers were involved. In this group, the intervention delayed by 64 days the introduction of a pacifier (21‚Äì85 days), compared to 25 days in the group without the participation of grandmothers (65‚Äì90 days). Conclusions: The intervention reduced pacifier use in the first six months of life and delayed its introduction until beyond the first month when grandmothers were involved. The intervention did not have a significant impact when only teenage mothers were involved. ¬© 2018 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria","Giugliani, E. R. J. and Nunes, L. M. and Issler, R. M.

Participants were professionals in 79 clinics across 20 U.S. states and elsewhere in North America, collectively serving 20,941 families via a Web-based screeningervice, PEDS Online, which offers developmental-behavioral/mental health and autism screens with automated scoring, report writing, and a mineable database. Problematic screening results were found in more than 1 out of 5 children, and rates of screening test failures increased with children's ages. Children screened outside the well-child visit schedule were more likely to have screening test failures. Personnel at 22 of the 79 clinics were either interviewed or observed in person to identify implementation strategies. Clinics, even those serving families with limited education or lack of facility with English, found a variety of ways to make use of online screening services. ¬© 2015 National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.","Glascoe, F.

700,Acoustic characteristics of crying in infantile laryngomalacia,"The purpose of this study was to add to the extant data base of acoustic cry studies by profiling the condition of laryngomalacia. We hypothesized that the acoustic characteristics of crying produced by an infant with laryngomalacia would differ compared to previously reported cry data for normal infants. An entire episode of crying was audio recorded and acoustically analyzed for the occurrence of expiratory and inspiratory cry segments, as well as the long-time average spectral (LTAS) characteristics. Results obtained for the infant were found to be considerably different from what has been previously reported for normal infants. The overall duration of the infant's crying episode was longer, with proportionately fewer expiratory phonations and more inspiratory phonations compared to normal infants. The LTAS results were reflective of aperiodic components in the glottal source spectrum. Collectively, the infant's unusual crying aspects were not limited solely to those acoustic features resulting from a prolapse of supraglottic soft tissue, and therefore provide new insight into the vocal fold vibratory behavior characterizing infantile laryngomalacia.","Goberman, A.

703,Comparative heel stick study showed that newborn infants who had undergone repeated painful procedures showed increased short-term pain responses,"AIM: We evaluated the short-term effect of repeated pain exposure on the pain responses of newborn infants using different pain assessment methods, as this area had been under-researched. METHODS: We compared 20 term, large for gestational age infants and 40 term, appropriate for gestational age controls. All had undergone a heel stick for a newborn screening test just before discharge, but the larger babies had also undergone at least other five painful stimuli prior to that. A pulse oximeter and a skin conductance algesimeter (SCA) were connected to the babies during the heel prick, and video recordings were made. Crying time, the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2) ) and SCA measurements were compared within and between the groups. RESULTS: After the heel prick, the crying time (p¬†=¬†0.021) and NIPS (p¬†=¬†0.013) scores were significantly higher in the study group and the SpO(2) levels were significantly lower (p¬†=¬†0.009), but the heart rate (p¬†=¬†0.981) was not significantly different between the groups. SCA measurements did not differ significantly between the groups. CONCLUSION: Babies who received more painful stimuli during the first few days of life showed greater pain responses during a subsequent heel prick.","Gokulu, G. and Bilgen, H. and Ozdemir, H. and Sarioz, A. and Memisoglu, A. and Gucuyener, K. and Ozek, E.",0,554
705,Parental reports of 'MAMA' sounds in infants: An exploratory study,"This study investigated the use of 'mama' or similar sounds (collectively referred to as 'MAMA') by 75 infants less than six months of age. Parents were directed to listen for 'MAMA' sounds and to note the sounds made, the age of onset, whether the sounds appeared to be directed to any person or persons and whether they appeared to have a purpose. 'MAMA' began at a mode of two months, range two weeks to five months, was usually part of a cry, and was always interpreted as a 'wanting' sound. Most parents thought that the infant wanted some form of attention, but a minority thought it indicated hunger. Responses to a Structured Response Protocol indicated that some infants uttering 'MAMA' were satisfied if a favourite caretaker approached and paid attention to them while the remainder were satisfied if they were both paid attention to and picked up. The 'MAMA' cry appears to promote attention-giving behaviour by parents and other caretakers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Goldman, Herbert I.",1,555
706,A real world evaluation of a treatment for infant colic based on the experience and perceptions of 4004 parents,"Infant colic (IC) is a common condition in young babies seen by primary care health professionals, especially health visitors. Nevertheless, the diagnostic criteria for IC are vague, which has resulted in a lack of clarity in published guidance on its causes and treatment. Credence has been given to alternative therapies, while health professionals are sceptical about the efficacy of over-the-counter treatments. Some 4004 parents of babies considered to have IC participated in this retrospective real world evidence study on the efficacy of a simeticone suspension in the treatment of IC. They were recruited via social media sources and were eligible for inclusion if their baby had received at least one dose of the simeticone suspension. Data were collected via an online questionnaire. The results showed that crying and discomfort-associated behaviour reduced and the babies' sleeping patterns improved following use of the suspension. More than twothirds (69.7%) of respondents, who either used the suspension on its own or alongside another treatment, reported improvements in the signs of IC within one day. Almost all (93.2%) considered that its use was associated with either complete resolution of IC or had some effect on symptoms. ¬© 2017 MA Healthcare Ltd.","Goldman, M. and Beaumont, T.",0,556

A questionnaire was used for maternal and infant characteristic data collection at hospital discharge following delivery and at 3 and 6 months postpartum, to identify patterns and correlates in the quantitative breast-feeding practices. From March, 1999 to September 2000 50 consecutive migrant women (55% African, 35% Balcanic, 7% Latin-American and 3% Indo-Chinese) and 100 consecutive native control mothers, matched for gestational age, were invited to participate in this study. Twelve weeks was chosen as a reasonable cut-off time for ""Early or Later Weaning"", after breast-feeding initiation upon hospital discharge. The strength of linear correlation between educational level (years) of native and migrant lactating women versus age, parity, pre- and post-gestational body weight, duration of breast-feeding (3 and 6 months), and number of fetal ultrasound screenings during gestation was assessed. At maternity hospital discharge the migrant women had high breast-feeding rates, similar to native women (99% and 96%, respectively). In both migrant and native mother samples a sharp fall in breast-feeding practice followed discharge.

711,An illustrative case for addressing infant mental health referrals,"Problem: Despite knowing the importance of the early detection of adverse experiences, mental health disorders beginning or occurring during early childhood can be difficult to recognize. To address this gap, this manuscript describes the care of a parent‚Äìchild dyad utilizing the nursing process in an illustrative case. Methods: This illustrative case provides a scenario that includes the early detection of infant mental health (IMH) in primary care with referral to a psychiatric mental health advanced practice nurse (PMHNP) and highlights how integrative care with PMHNP can facilitate the use of the nursing process to promote optimal early childhood growth and development and prevent long-term mental health problems. Findings: The collaboration between the primary care provider and PMHNP in addressing a common diagnosis observed in IMH (i.e., feeding disorder) where a 6-month-old infant presented with poor weight gain due to detached parenting, secondary to maternal depression, resulted in early infant‚Äìparent intervention that reduced maternal depression and normalized infant growth. Conclusions: The screening of IMH in pediatric primary care promotes early referral and collaboration with the PMHNP to address IMH problems to promote optimal growth and social-emotional development in early childhood. ¬© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Gordon, J.

712,Identification of neonatal hearing impairment: distortion product otoacoustic emissions during the perinatal period,"OBJECTIVES: 1) To describe distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) levels, noise levels and signal to noise ratios (SNRs) for a wide range of frequencies and two stimulus levels in neonates and infants. 2) To describe the relations between these DPOAE measurements and age, test environment, baby state, and test time. DESIGN: DPOAEs were measured in 2348 well babies without risk indicators, 353 well babies with at least one risk indicator, and 4478 graduates of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). DPOAE and noise levels were measured at f2 frequencies of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 kHz, and for primary levels (L1/L2) of 65/50 dB SPL and 75/75 dB SPL. Measurement-based stopping rules were used such that a test did not terminate unless the response was at least 3 dB above the mean noise floor + 2 SDs (SNR) for at least four of five test frequencies. The test would terminate, however, if these criteria were not met after 360 sec. Baby state, test environment, and other test factors were captured at the time of each test. RESULTS: DPOAE levels, noise levels and SNRs were similar for well babies without risk indicators, well babies with risk indicators, and NICU graduates.

DESIGN: Qualitative and quantitative assessments in the form of interviews and questionnaires administered in French. SETTING: Two birthing institutions in Montr√©al, QC, Canada: a university hospital and a regional center. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and sixty-three parents (73.8% mothers, 26.2% fathers) received the intervention after the birth of their child, and 69 nurses administered it. METHODS: Parents' and nurses' assessments of the adequacy and relevance of the program and nurses' assessments of the training they received to administer the program were evaluated. RESULTS: Both parents and nurses supported this initiative. Most parents appreciated the usefulness of the information. Nurses believed the program was adequate, and their training to deliver the program was satisfactory. All participants reported that the program was highly relevant, especially for new parents. CONCLUSION: The Perinatal Shaken Baby Syndrome Prevention Program achieves the goals of (a) increasing parents' knowledge about infant crying, anger, and shaken baby syndrome and (b) helping parents identify coping strategies. The relevance of introducing the PSBSPP in all birthing institutions is supported. Future studies should focus on vulnerable and culturally diverse populations, and longitudinal follow-up could help determine if the PSBSPP reduces the incidence of shaken baby syndrome.","Goulet, C. and Frappier, J.

715,Can oral sucrose reduce the pain and distress associated with screening for retinopathy of prematurity?,"OBJECTIVE: Infants undergoing eye exams to screen for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) demonstrate physiologic and behavioral manifestations of pain and distress. Oral sucrose has analgesic properties that might reduce these effects. AIM: To determine the efficacy of oral sucrose in reducing the pain/distress of eye exams for ROP. METHODS: A total of 32 infants about to undergo ROP screening exams received either oral sucrose [S] (N=16) or sterile water [C] (N=16) in a randomized, prospective and blinded fashion. Outcome measures included HR, RR, O(2) saturation, BP, pain (premature infant pain profile) and percent of time spent crying during the eye exam. RESULTS: The groups were similar in GA (weeks) (28+/-1.6), BW (kg) (1.04+/-0.26), postnatal age (days) 50.8+/-20.3, and study weight (kg) 1.88+/-0.40). Both groups demonstrated significant increases in HR, BP, and pain score in response to the exam. Infants in both groups spent the majority of time actively crying during the exam ([S] 53+/-35% vs [C] 63+/-31%. Infants receiving [S] showed a small but significant drop in O(2) saturation. No significant differences were seen between groups in physiologic or behavioral responses to the eye exam. CONCLUSION: Oral [S] was not effective in reducing pain/distress from the ROP screening exam. Alternative strategies should be considered to achieve adequate pain relief.","Grabska, J. and Walden, P. and Lerer, T. and Kelly, C. and Hussain, N. and Donovan, T. and Herson, V.",0,562

The local anesthetic cream EMLA has recently been shown to be safe for use in neonates. This study compared the pain-reducing effect of orally administered glucose with that of EMLA cream during venipuncture in newborns. METHODS: Randomized, controlled, double-blind study including 201 newborns undergoing venipuncture for clinical purposes. Ninety-nine of the newborns received EMLA on the skin and orally administered placebo (sterile water), and 102 received glucose 30% orally and placebo (Unguentum Merck) on the skin. Symptoms associated with pain at venipuncture were measured with the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scale (also validated for full-term infants). Heart rate and crying time were recorded. RESULTS: There were no differences in background variables between the 2 groups. The results shows that the PIPP scores were significantly lower in the glucose group (mean: 4.6) compared with the EMLA group (mean: 5.7). The duration of crying in the first 3 minutes was significantly lower in the glucose group (median: 1 second) than in the EMLA group (median: 18 seconds). There were significantly fewer patients in the glucose group who were scored having pain (defined as PIPP score above 6)","Gradin, M. and Eriksson, M. and Holmqvist, G. and Holstein, A. and Schollin, J.",0,563
718,Behavioral interventions for infant sleep problems: A randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of behavioral interventions on the sleep/wakefulness of infants, parent and infant stress, and later child emotional/behavioral problems, and parent-child attachment. METHODS: A total of 43 infants (6-16 months, 63% girls) were randomized to receive either graduated extinction (n = 14), bedtime fading (n = 15), or sleep education control (n = 14). Sleep measures included parent-reported sleep diaries and infant actigraphy. Infant stress was measured via morning and afternoon salivary cortisol sampling, and mothers' self-reported mood and stress. Twelve months after intervention, mothers completed assessments of children's emotional and behavioral problems, and mother-child dyads underwent the strange situation procedure to evaluate parent-child attachment. RESULTS: Significant interactions were found for sleep latency (P < .05), number of awakenings (P < .0001), and wake after sleep onset (P = .01), with large decreases in sleep latency for graduated extinction and bedtime fading groups, and large decreases in number of awakenings and wake after sleep onset for the graduated extinction group. Salivary cortisol showed small-to-moderate declines in graduated extinction and bedtime fading groups compared with controls. Mothers' stress showed small-to-moderate decreases for the graduated extinction and bedtime fading conditions over the first month, yet no differences in mood were detected. At the 12-month follow-up, no significant differences were found in emotional and behavioral problems, and no significant differences in secureinsecure attachment styles between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both graduated extinction and bedtime fading provide significant sleep benefits above control, yet convey no adverse stress responses or long-term effects on parent-child attachment or child emotions and behavior.

720,Maternal and Child Characteristics Associated With Mother‚ÄìChild Interaction in One-Year-Olds,"Mothers‚Äô interactions with their young children have predicted later child development, behavior, and health, but evidence has been developed mainly in at-risk clinical samples. An economically and racially diverse sample of pregnant women who were not experiencing a high-risk pregnancy were recruited to participate in a community-based, longitudinal study of factors associated with child cognitive and social-emotional development during the first 3 years. The purpose of the present analysis was to identify associations between the characteristics of 1125 mothers and their 1-year-olds and the mothers‚Äô and children's scores on the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS). A multivariable approach was used to identify maternal and child characteristics associated with NCATS scores and to develop prediction models for NCATS total and subscale scores of mothers and children. Child expressive and receptive communication and maternal IQ, marital status, age, and insurance predicted NCATS Mother total score, accounting for 28% of the score variance. Child expressive communication and birth weight predicted the NCATS Child total score, accounting for 4% of variance. Child's expressive communication and mother's IQ and marital status predicted NCATS mother-child total scores. While these findings were similar to reports of NCATS scores in at-risk populations, no previous teams examined all of the mother and child characteristics included in this analysis. These findings support the utility of the NCATS for assessing mother-child interaction and predicting child outcomes in community-based, non-clinical populations. ¬© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ¬© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Graff, J.

Similar acoustic measures were applied to the cries immediately preceding and following an inspiratory cry as a means of characterizing an inspiratory ""event."" Results were that the number of inspiratory cries varied considerably from child to child during a complete crying episode. The duration and Fo of inspiratory cries were significantly shorter and higher, respectively, in comparison to cries immediately preceding and following the inspiratory cry. In addition, the gap duration following an inspiratory cry was significantly greater than the pre-inspiratory gap duration. Discussion centers on the anatomical and physiological bases of inspiratory cry phonation. Implications as well as the need to consider the inspiratory portion of crying behavior when examining infants at risk for respiratory distress also are discussed.","Grau, S. M. and Robb, M.

724,Fathers' and mothers' perceptions of temperament in Israeli neonates: effects of adoption and social class,"As part of a longitudinal follow-up study of the development of adopted and biological children in Israel, 87 couples were administered the Bates Infant Characteristics Questionnaire when their first infants were 21 to 30 days old. Middleclass adoptive parents and a middle-class biological-parent control sample constituted one group. A second group comprised a lower-class sample. Mothers in all groups saw the child as more difficult in terms of strength of cry and reactions to being dressed as compared to fathers. Mothers perceived the child as more predictable for diaper changes and sleep. Adoptive parents saw their child as easier, that is, having more stable and positive mood states. Adoptive mothers saw their neonates as more active than the biological mothers. Middle-class parents saw their children as more soothable and as less disturbing in their emotional behavior than lower-class parents. The results indicate that neonatal temperament can be studied and that parental perception is influenced by sex of parent, biological relationship to the child and environmental factors, such as social class and early intervention.","Greenbaum, C.

METHODS: An experimental design examined pain responses of 84 newborns undergoing heelstick. They were randomly assigned to one of four groups: (a) water-moistened pacifier, (b) sugar-coated pacifier, (c) 2 cc of a 12% oral sucrose solution, or (d) control. Pain measures were duration of cry, vagal tone, and salivary cortisol. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed that the sugar-coated pacifier group cried significantly less than the water-moistened pacifier and control groups. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the sugar-coated pacifier group demonstrated significantly lower vagal tone during heelstick than the oral sucrose solution and control groups. This difference between the sugar-coated pacifier and control groups persevered for 15 minutes after heelstick. CONCLUSIONS: Offering a sugar coated pacifier during heelstick in healthy neonates reduces pain behaviors more effectively than a water-moistened pacifier, 2 cc of a 12% sucrose solution, or no intervention.","Greenberg, C.

727,Contributors to Dysbiosis in Very-Low-Birth-Weight Infants,"The objective of this commentary was to analyze the causes and outcomes of gut microbiome dysbiosis in preterm infants who are born at very low birth weight (VLBW). The intrauterine development of VLBW infants is interrupted abruptly with preterm birth and followed by extrauterine, health-threatening conditions and sequelae. These infants develop intestinal microbial dysbiosis characterized by low diversity, an overall reduction in beneficial and/or commensal bacteria, and enrichment of opportunistic pathogens of the Gammaproteobacteria class. The origin of VLBW infant dysbiosis is not well understood and is likely the result of a combination of immaturity and medical care. We propose that these factors interact to produce inflammation in the gut, which further perpetuates dysbiosis. Understanding the sources of dysbiosis could result in interventions to reduce gut inflammation, decrease enteric pathology, and improve health outcomes for these vulnerable infants. The authors describe gut microbiome dysbiosis in preterm infants, related influencing factors, and potential for inflammatory outcomes. ¬© 2020","Groer, M. W. and Miller, E.

729,Fecal microflora in healthy infants born by different methods of delivery: Permanent changes in intestinal flora after cesarean delivery,"Background: Newborn infants in modern maternity hospitals are subject to numerous factors that affect normal intestinal colonization - for example, cesarean delivery and antimicrobial agents. To study the duration of the effect of external factors on intestinal colonization, two groups of infants with different delivery methods were investigated. Methods: The fecal flora of 64 healthy infants was studied prospectively. Thirty-four infants were delivered vaginally, and 30 by cesarean birth with antibiotic prophylaxis administered to their mothers before the delivery. The fecal flora was cultured on nonselective and selective media in infants 3 to 5, 10, 30, 60, and 180 days of age. Gastrointestinal signs were recorded daily by the mothers for 2 months. Results: The fecal colonization of infants born by cesarean delivery was delayed. Bifidobacterium-like bacteria and Lactobacillus-like bacteria colonization rates reached the rates of vaginally delivered infants at 1 month and 10 days, respectively. Infants born by cesarean delivery were significantly less often colonized with bacteria of the Bacteroides fragilis group than were vaginally delivered infants: At 6 months the rates were 36% and 76% respectively (p = 0.009). The occurrence of gastrointestinal signs did not differ between the study groups. Conclusions: This study shows for the first time that the primary gut flora in infants born by cesarean delivery may be disturbed for up to 6 months after the birth. The clinical relevance of these changes is unknown and even longer follow-up is needed to establish how long-lasting these alterations of the primary gut flora can be.","Gr√∂nlund, M.

731,Additive effects of household food insecurity during pregnancy and infancy on maternal infant feeding styles and practices,"Food insecurity, or the limited access to food, has been associated with maternal child feeding styles and practices. While studies in other parenting domains suggest differential and additive impacts of poverty-associated stressors during pregnancy and infancy, few studies have assessed relations between food insecurity during these sensitive times and maternal infant feeding styles and practices. This study sought to analyze these relations in low-income Hispanic mother-infant pairs enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of an early obesity prevention program (Starting Early). Food insecurity was measured prenatally and during infancy at 10 months. Food insecurity timing was categorized as never, prenatal only, infancy only, or both. Regression analyses were used to determine relations between food insecurity timing and styles and practices at 10 months, using never experiencing food insecurity as the reference, adjusting for family characteristics and material hardships. 412 mother-infant pairs completed 10-month assessments. Prolonged food insecurity during both periods was associated with greater pressuring, indulgent and laissez-faire styles compared to never experiencing food insecurity. Prenatal food insecurity was associated with less vegetable and more juice intake. If food insecurity is identified during pregnancy, interventions to prevent food insecurity from persisting into infancy may mitigate the development of obesity-promoting feeding styles and practices. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Gross, R.

735,Why functional pre-erythrocytic and bloodstage malaria vaccines fail: A meta-analysis of fully protective immunizations and novel immunological model,"Background: Clinically protective malaria vaccines consistently fail to protect adults and children in endemic settings, and at best only partially protect infants. Methodology/Principal Findings: We identify and evaluate 1916 immunization studies between 1965-February 2010, and exclude partially or nonprotective results to find 177 completely protective immunization experiments. Detailed reexamination reveals an unexpectedly mundane basis for selective vaccine failure: live malaria parasites in the skin inhibit vaccine function. We next show published molecular and cellular data support a testable, novel model where parasite-host interactions in the skin induce malaria-specific regulatory T cells, and subvert early antigen-specific immunity to parasite-specific immunotolerance. This ensures infection and tolerance to reinfection. Exposure to Plasmodium-infected mosquito bites therefore systematically triggers immunosuppression of endemic vaccine-elicited responses. The extensive vaccine trial data solidly substantiate this model experimentally. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude skinstage-initiated immunosuppression, unassociated with bloodstage parasites, systematically blocks vaccine function in the field. Our model exposes novel molecular and procedural strategies to significantly and quickly increase protective efficacy in both pipeline and currently ineffective malaria vaccines, and forces fundamental reassessment of central precepts determining vaccine development. This has major implications for accelerated local eliminations of malaria, and significantly increases potential for eradication. ¬© 2010 Guilbride et al.","Guilbride, D.

736,Differential DNA methylation profiles of infants exposed to maternal asthma during pregnancy,"Background Asthma is a complex disease that involves both genetic factors and environmental exposures. Aberrant epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, may be important in asthma development. Fetal exposure to maternal asthma during critical periods of in utero development may lead to epigenetic alterations that predispose infants to a greater risk of developing asthma themselves. We investigated alterations in the DNA methylation profile of peripheral blood from infants exposed to maternal asthma during pregnancy. Methods Peripheral blood was collected from 12-month-old infants born to women with (n = 25) and without (n = 15) doctor diagnosed asthma during pregnancy. Genomic DNA was extracted, bisulfite converted, and hybridized to Infinium Methylation 27 arrays (Illumina), containing over27,000 CpGs from 14,495 genes. CpG loci in only autosomal genes were classified as differentially methylated at the 99% level (P < 0.01, |DiffScore| > 22 and delta beta >0.06). Results There were 70 CpG loci, corresponding to 67 genes that were significantly differentially methylated. Twelve CpG loci (11 genes) showed greater than 10% comparative difference in DNA methylation, including hyper-methylated loci of FAM181A, MRI1, PIWIL1, CHFR, DEFA1, MRPL28, AURKA, and hypo-methylated loci of NALP1L5, MAP8KIP3, ACAT2, and PM20D1 in maternal asthma.

737,Faecal calprotectin levels during the first year of life in healthy children,"Aim: A high faecal calprotectin (FC) level is a non-invasive marker for inflammatory bowel disease. Nevertheless, healthy infants have elevated levels of FC with large variations. The aim of our study was to determine the levels of FC and associated factors in healthy infants aged 0‚Äì12 months. Methods: Infants younger than 1 year of age were in the follow-up programme of the Well Child Unit. Data on the clinical characteristics, including birth, anthropometric measurements and feeding types of infants in the unit, were obtained from their personal health records. One fresh stool sample was collected from each infant. ELISA was used to measure FC. Results: We included 84 infants younger than 1 year of age. The median FC value was 313 Œºg/g. The FC levels were greater in the youngest (0‚Äì30 days) group of infants than in the oldest (181‚Äì365 days) group (P < 0.001). The FC levels were higher in infants delivered by caesarean section than in those delivered vaginally (P = 0.016). The levels were also higher in infants who were solely breastfed than in those who received mixed feeding (breast milk and formula) during the first 6 months of life (P = 0.030). Conclusion: The FC levels in this group of infants were high, especially in the first month of life. Several birth and environmental factors influenced the FC values. Further studies with a larger cohort of infants and serial assessment of FC over time are required to better understand the patterns of this biomarker during infancy. ¬© 2020 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)","G√ºnaydƒ±n ≈ûahin, B.

738,"The study of women, infant feeding and type 2 diabetes after GDM pregnancy and growth of their offspring (SWIFT Offspring study): Prospective design, methodology and baseline characteristics","Background: Breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of becoming overweight or obese later in life. Breastfed babies grow more slowly during infancy than formula-fed babies. Among offspring exposed in utero to maternal glucose intolerance, prospective data on growth during infancy have been unavailable. Thus, scientific evidence is insufficient to conclude that breastfeeding reduces the risk of obesity among the offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM). To address this gap, we devised the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM Pregnancy and Growth of their Offspring, also known as the SWIFT Offspring Study. This prospective, longitudinal study recruited mother-infant pairs from the SWIFT Study, a prospective study of women with recent gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The goal of the SWIFT Offspring Study is to determine whether breastfeeding intensity and duration, compared with formula feeding, are related to slower growth of GDM offspring during the first year life. This article details the study design, participant eligibility, data collection, and methodologies. We also describe the baseline characteristics of the GDM mother-infant pairs. Methods: The study enrolled 466 mother-infant pairs among GDM deliveries in northern California from 2009-2011. Participants attended three in-person study exams at 6-9 weeks, 6 months and 12 months after delivery for infant anthropometry (head circumference, body weight, length, abdominal circumference and skinfold thicknesses), as well as maternal anthropometry (body weight, waist circumference and percent body fat). Mothers also completed questionnaires on health and lifestyle behaviors, including infant diet, sleep and temperament. Breastfeeding intensity and duration were assessed via several sources (diaries, telephone interviews, monthly mailings and in-person exams) from birth through the first year of life. Pregnancy course, clinical perinatal and newborn outcomes were obtained from health plan electronic medical records. Infant saliva samples were collected and stored for genetics studies. Discussion: This large, racially and ethnically diverse cohort of GDM offspring will enable evaluation of the relationship of infant feeding to growth during infancy independent of perinatal characteristics, sociodemographics and other risk factors. The longitudinal design provides the first quantitative measures of breastfeeding intensity and duration among GDM offspring during early life. ¬© 2015 Gunderson et al.","Gunderson, E.

739,Neonatal stress reactivity: predictions to later emotional temperament,"To investigate the relations among popular measures of neonatal stress and their link to subsequent temperament, 50 full-term newborns from a normal care nursery were examined responding to a heelstick blood draw. Baseline and heelstick measures of behavioral state, heart period, vagal tone, and salivary cortisol were obtained. Recovery measures of behavioral and cardiac activity were also analyzed. Mothers completed Rothbart's Infant Behavior Questionnaire when their infants reached 6 months of age. Baseline vagal tone predicted cortisol in response to the heelstick, suggesting that baseline vagal tone reflects the infants' ability to react to stressors. Greater reactivity to the heelstick (more crying, shorter heart periods, lower vagal tone, and higher cortisol) was associated with lower scores on ""Distress-to-Limitations"" temperament at 6 months. This finding was consistent with the expectation that the capacity to react strongly to an aversive stimulus would reflect better neurobehavioral organization in the newborn. Recovery measures of cardiac activity approximated and were correlated with baseline measures indicating the strong self-righting properties of the healthy newborn. Finally, vagal tone and salivary cortisol measures were not significantly related, suggesting the importance of assessing both systems in studies of the ontogeny of stress-temperament relations.","Gunnar, M.

DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study. A 5-year retrospective study was performed between January 2012 and July 2016 in the Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China, to determine the clinical features and pathological lead points of recurrent intussusception. SETTING: This is a retrospective chart review of recurrent intussusception cases in a large university teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The medical records were obtained for 1007 cases with intussusception, including demographics, clinical signs and symptoms, imaging and recurrence times if available. INTERVENTIONS: Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to measure significant factors affecting recurrent intussusception and recurrent intussusception with pathological lead points. RESULTS: There were 481 total episodes of recurrence in 191 patients. Among these, 87 had one recurrence and 104 had multiple recurrences. After comparing recurrent and non-recurrent intussusception cases using univariate analysis, it was determined that the factors associated with recurrent intussusception were age (>1‚Äâyear), duration of symptoms (‚â§12‚Äâhours), the lack of bloody stool, paroxysmal crying or vomiting, the mass location (right abdomen) and pathological lead point (P<0.05). Age (>1‚Äâyear), duration of symptoms (‚â§12‚Äâhours), the absence of vomiting, mass location (right abdomen) and pathological lead point were significantly independently predictive of recurrent intussusception. The factors associated with recurrent intussusception with lead points present were vomiting and mass location in the right abdomen (P<0.05). Vomiting and mass location (left abdomen) were significantly predictive of recurrent intussusception with lead points. CONCLUSIONS: Age (>1‚Äâyear), symptom duration (‚â§12‚Äâhours), the absence of vomiting, mass location (right abdomen) and pathological lead points were significantly predictive of recurrent intussusception. Vomiting and mass location (left abdomen) were significantly predictive of recurrent intussusception with lead points.","Guo, W. L. and Hu, Z. C. and Tan, Y. L. and Sheng, M. and Wang, J.",0,584

Methods: A study was conducted in university quaternary research hospital with DMD patients confirmed by MLPA (multiplex ligation ‚Äì dependent probe amplification) method and were evaluated between January 2012 and December 2015. Their ambulatory status, detailed neurological and functional status were recorded. Requirement of AFOs was determined and provided. Results: In total 126 DMD children reported to the NMD clinic. Mean age at presentation was 7.6 y (range 2 to12 y, SD 2.1). Mean duration of illness at first evaluation was 3.4 y (range 0.5 to 10 y, SD 2.0). AFO‚Äôs were advised at a mean age of 8.5 y (range 7 to 12 y, SD 1.8). Fifty-nine patients were advised AFO as resting or walking splint. At last follow-up 113 patients were still ambulatory whereas 13 had become wheel chair bound. Out of 59 patients, 48 were still wearing AFOs and the remaining discontinued AFOs for various reasons. Conclusions: Children with DMD require wearing of AFOs as resting or walking splint, mostly in first or early second decade of life. As there is some gap between onset of clinical signs and requirement of orthosis, follow-up preferably at a multidisciplinary clinic at regular intervals is desirable for timely intervention in the form of AFOs or other splints to prolong ambulatory status in these patients. ¬© 2016, Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.","Gupta, A. and Nalini, A. and Arya, S.

The secondary objective was to evaluate if the analgesic effect of EMLA was synergistic to breastfeeding. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial was done to include infants of up to 3 months of age who came for their first DPT vaccination. The outcome variables were duration of cry, latency of onset of cry, and Modified Facial Coding Score. Thirty babies were enrolled in each of three groups. The groups did not differ significantly in baseline characteristics. Median (interquartile range) of duration of cry was least [34.6 (24.1-72.2)‚Äâs] in babies receiving EMLA cream with breastfeeding (EB group), followed by 94.2 (46.1-180)‚Äâs in babies receiving EMLA cream with oral distilled water (EW group), as compared to 180.0 (180-180)‚Äâs in babies receiving placebo cream with oral distilled water (PCW group) (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05). Mean (SD) of latency of cry was significantly greater in EB group [2.4 (1.14)‚Äâs] and EW group [1.9 (0.62)‚Äâs] as compared to babies in PCW group [1.5 (0.47)‚Äâs] (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05), but the difference between EB and EW groups was not significant.

744,Randomized controlled trial of topical EMLA and vapocoolant spray for reducing pain during wDPT vaccination,"BACKGROUND: Intramuscular vaccination is among the most common source of iatrogenic pain in infants. Vapocoolant sprays are rapid-acting alternative to topical anesthetics. They provide transient anesthesia via evaporation induced skin cooling, and reduce pain due to vaccine injection in children and adults. The objective was to compare the synergistic analgesic effect of eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA) with breastfeeding (EB group) and vapocoolant spay with breastfeeding (VB group) to that of only breastfeeding (BO group) during whole cell diptheria, pertussis and tetanus (wDPT) vaccination. METHODS: A double blind randomized controlled trial was done to include infants up to 3 months of age who came for their first wDPT vaccination. The primary outcome variable was the duration of cry after vaccination. Secondary outcome variables were Modified Facial Coding Score, Neonatal Infant Pain Scale and latency of onset of cry. RESULTS: Of the 201 eligible participants, 111 babies were excluded and remaining 90 babies were randomized into three groups of thirty each. The groups did not differ significantly in baseline characteristics. Median (interquartile range, IQR) of duration of cry was lesser [35.86 (21.07-107.75) seconds] in babies receiving EMLA cream with breast feeding (EB group) and in babies receiving vapocoolant spray with breast feeding (VB group) [32.58 (21.25-106.21) seconds] as compared to babies receiving only breast feeding (BO group) [67.5 (27.6-180) seconds] (P=0.147). Difference in median (IQR) of latency of cry was not statistically significant. Modified Facial Coding Score and Neonatal Infant Pain Scale at 1 minute and 3 minutes was significantly lower in the EB and VB group, as compared to the BO group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Addition of topical EMLA application or vapocoolant spray to breastfeeding during wDPT vaccination does not reduce duration of cry in infants up to 3 months of age. However, they are able to show reduction in pain score and further studies are warranted to assess their efficacy as pain relief measures in infants and children.","Gupta, N.

745,On the importance of fundamental frequency and other acoustic features in cry perception and infant development,"Examined acoustic correlates of adults' ratings of infants' cries. 20 parents of 10 3‚Äì6 mo old infants and 22 undergraduate nonparents rated 12 spontaneous cries from young infants on 8 items describing the cries' aversiveness and on 9 semantic differential items. Results indicate that the duration, the amount of dysphonation, and proportion of energy in various frequency bands were highly correlated with adults' ratings. Further, the pattern of correlations between each of the 17 rating scale items and the acoustic attributes was virtually the same, suggesting that the items represented a single underlying dimension of perceived aversiveness. No differences were found between the results for parents and nonparents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Gustafson, Gwen E. and Green, James A.",0,589
746,Acoustic correlates of individuality in the cries of human infants,"400 nonparent undergraduates performed a recognition task in which they were asked to classify 20 30-day-old infants as easy or difficult to recognize on the sole basis of their tape-recorded cries. The cries of easy- vs difficult-to-recognize infants were then compared on measures of duration, fundamental frequency, peak frequency in the spectrum, signal-to-noise ratios, and energy in selected frequency bands. Results indicate that each of these measures differentiated the cries of easy- vs difficult-to-recognize infants. It is suggested that such redundancy should make the cry robust to degradations of selected acoustic parameters, thus enhancing its ability to carry information about individual identity across distances.

748,Risk and resilience,"The study of childhood resilience focuses on why children demonstrate positive adaptation despite experiencing significant risk in their lives. Risk factors - such as poverty, maltreatment, and war - increase the likelihood of maladjustment in children. Protective factors - such as children‚Äôs psychological and personality characteristics, supportive and structured parenting, and the availability of external support systems - buffer the effects of risk factors leading to positive development. Resilience is a dynamic and developmental process that can be modified as new risks and/or protective factors emerge with changing life circumstances. Current research on resilience is focused on identifying those protective processes that can be adapted through interventions to meet the needs of children facing adversity. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.

749,How many children in Australia are at risk of adult mental illness?,"Objective: To estimate the prevalence of children in the Australian population with risk factors for adult mental illness. Method: Key risk factors and risk domains were identified from a 2013 review of longitudinal studies on child and adolescent determinants of adult mental illness. Data items were identified from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children that map onto the risk domains and were used to estimate the prevalence of these key individual risk factors and the magnitude of multiple risk in children aged 3 months to 13 years. Results: Even by infancy, risk factors for adult mental illness are highly prevalent, with 51.7% of infants having multiple risks. In 10 infants, 1 was born to mothers who consumed daily alcohol and 1 in 8 to mothers who smoked cigarettes daily during pregnancy. Also, 10.5% of infants were in families where the parents had separated, which increased to 18% in 10-11 year-olds. Psychological problems in the clinical range (based on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire total problems score) ranged from 7.8% to 9.7% across the 4-13 years age range. Risks from negative parenting behaviours were highly prevalent across age groups. Two-thirds of children aged 12-13 years had parents who displayed low warmth or exhibited high hostility/anger. Across childhood, one in seven children are in families exposed to 3+ major life stressors. By age 8-9 years, more than 18% of children are exposed to '3/45 risk factors. Conclusions: We find that modifiable risk factors for adult mental illness occur at the earliest stage in the life course and at greater prevalence than is commonly recognised. Considerable capacity will be required in child and adolescent mental health services and complementary family support programmes if risk factors for adult mental illness that are already apparent in infancy and childhood are to be addressed. ¬© The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.","Guy, S. and Furber, G. and Leach, M. and Segal, L.",0,592

751,Very preterm infants show earlier emergence of 24-hour sleep-wake rhythms compared to term infants,"Background: Previous studies show contradictory results about the emergence of 24-h rhythms and the influence of external time cues on sleep-wake behavior in preterm compared to term infants. Aims: To examine whether very preterm infants (<. 32. weeks of gestational age) differ in their emergence of the 24-h sleep-wake rhythm at 5, 11 and 25. weeks corrected age compared to term infants and whether cycled light conditions during neonatal intermediate care affects postnatal 24-h sleep-wake rhythms in preterm infants. Study design: Prospective cohort study with nested interventional trial.Subjects: 34 preterm and 14 control term infants were studied. During neonatal hospitalization, preterm infants were randomly assigned to cycled light [7. am-7. pm lights on, 7. pm-7. am lights off, n = 17] or dim light condition [lights off whenever the child is asleep, n = 17].Outcome measures: Sleep and activity behavior recorded by parental diary and actigraphy at 5, 11 and 25. weeks corrected age. Results: Sleep at nighttime and the longest consolidated sleep period between 12. pm-6. am was longer (mixed model analysis, factor group: p = 0.02, resp. p = 0.01) and activity at nighttime was lower (p = 0.005) at all ages in preterm compared to term infants. Cycled light exposed preterm infants showed the longest nighttime sleep duration. Dim light exposed preterm infants were the least active. Conclusions: Preterm infants show an earlier emergence of the 24-h sleep-wake rhythm compared to term infants. Thus, the length of exposure to external time cues such as light may be important for the maturation of infant sleep-wake rhythms. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Guyer, C. and Huber, R. and Fontijn, J. and Bucher, H.

752,Sleep in neonates and infants,"From a polyphasic sleep pattern at birth, sleep shifts towards the night and consolidates to one long nocturnal sleep period generally by 6-9 months of age. Sleep architecture matures from the immature active and quite sleep pattern in the first year of life to the mature form of rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. The timing and initiation of sleep and wake is governed by the interplay of the circadian rhythm with sleep homeostasis. Both sleep regulatory processes mature in the first few months after birth. The developing interaction of these two processes may be a key determinant for the maturation of sleep-wake behavior in the first year of life. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

753,State of awakeness during visual fixation in preterm infants,"To demonstrate the presence of discriminable awake states in preterm infants, facial behaviors and visual fixation to a single patterned stimulus were recorded. Five healthy preterm infants born at a mean of 29 weeks' gestation were followed from 30 to 35 weeks' postmenstrual age. Behaviors (eye openness, movements, mouthing, and vocalizations) were recorded simultaneously with visual fixation measured by the corneal reflection technique. Test time was determined by the duration of time the infant remained awake before crying or closing eyes. The presence of both quiet awakeness and drowsiness was demonstrated. Younger infants spent more time in drowsiness, whereas older infants had more quiet awakeness. Visual pattern fixation was observed as early as 30 weeks. Fixation time increased with increasing postmenstrual age. More fixation was observed during quiet awakeness than during drowsiness.","Hack, M. and Muszynski, S. Y. and Miranda, S. B.",0,596
754,A Qualitative Study of Women's Recall of Content and Skills Developed in Group Prenatal and Well-Baby Care 2 Years Later,"Introduction: Group prenatal and well-baby care is a system of health care visits that occur in a group setting. Each individual session lasts approximately 2 hours, allowing more time for education and support than can occur in an individual visit. Compared with individual care, research suggests that group care is associated with similar or better short-term outcomes, but no studies have yet examined potential long-term benefits beyond one year postpartum. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to elicit women's recall about content covered in group prenatal and well-baby care and whether they were or were not continuing to use skills discussed during group prenatal and well-baby care 2 or more years after their group ended. Methods: Eligible women participated in group prenatal and/or well-baby care between 2008 and 2012, were aged at least 18 years, and were English-speaking. Of the 127 eligible women, 32 were reached and 17 agreed to participate. Women were interviewed on average 3 years after group prenatal or well-baby care ended using a semistructured interview guide. Transcripts were reviewed and coded by each team member. Final codes and themes were identified using an iterative review process among the research team. Results: Three themes were identified: sustained change, transferable skills, and group as a safe haven. All women were still using strategies discussed during group and had made sustained improvements in nutrition, stress management, and/or in the quality of their interactions with their children, partner, or families. The group environment was described as a safe haven: a respectful, nonjudgmental space that allowed women to share and support each other while learning new skills. Discussion: This is the first study to document that group prenatal and well-baby care is associated with long-term benefits in areas not yet reported in the literature: nutrition, family communication, and parenting. ¬© 2018 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives","Hackley, B. and Elyachar-Stahl, E. and Savage, A.

755,Association of maternal depression and home adversities with infant hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis biomarkers in rural Pakistan,"Background: Each year, almost 35% of children are exposed to maternal depression and more grow up in persistent poverty, increasing the risk for stress-related disease and other socio-developmental deficits later in life. These impacts are likely related to chronic stress via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However, there is little evidence relating early windows of child HPA axis activity to multiple exposures. Methods: We investigated chronic measures of hair-derived HPA axis hormones (cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)) in 104 one-year old infants from rural Pakistan and longitudinal measures of maternal depression, intimate partner violence (IPV), socio-economic status (SES), and the home environment. Results: Estimates from adjusted linear mixed effects models did not reveal consistent significant associations between infant cortisol and maternal depression or home adversities. By contrast, infants exposed to maternal depression during pregnancy had lower DHEA levels (√ü= -0.18 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.34, -0.02) as did those whose mothers experienced multiple types of IPV (√ü=-4.14 95% CI: -7.42, -0.79) within one year postpartum. Higher SES had a significant positive association with infant DHEA levels (√ü= 0.77 95% CI: 0.08, 1.47). Depression severity and chronicity at one year postpartum had near significant associations with infant DHEA. Measures of home environment had no observable impacts on infant HPA axis activity. Limitations: Limitations include the modest sample size and aggregation of hair samples for analysis. Conclusion: Results point to possible early HPA axis dysregulation driven by changes in DHEA activity, but not cortisol at one year of age. Findings contribute to growing research examining intergenerational transmissions of maternal depression, IPV, and household environment on infant stress-response systems. ¬© 2020","Hagaman, A.

756,Gross motor skill performance in children with and without CHARGE syndrome: Research to practice,"Background: CHARGE syndrome is a multifaceted syndrome of complex birth defects. The heterogeneous nature of children with CHARGE syndrome brings unique issues and challenges affecting the overall motor development of the child, often resulting in developmental delays including motor delays. Aims: The purpose of this research was to assess children with CHARGE Syndrome on locomotor and object control skills to better understand their motor development. This information is relevant to adapted physical education teachers, paraeducators, vision teachers, health care professionals (occupational therapists, physical therapists, and physicians) and parents and family members of children with CHARGE Syndrome. Methods and Procedures: Thirty-seven children with CHARGE syndrome and thirty peers without disabilities participated in the study. Each participant was assessed on two object control and three locomotor skills with modifications, if necessary. In addition, the age of onset of independent walking was recorded for each participant. Outcome and results: Children with CHARGE syndrome performed significantly behind their same age peers in most gross motor skills with the biggest deficits found in the run and kick. Age of onset of walking was associated with performance in jumping, running, and throwing. Conclusions and implications: Early intervention services should focus on gross motor skills such as throwing, kicking, as well as walking at an early age. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Haibach-Beach, P. and Perreault, M. and Foster, E. and Lieberman, L.",0,599
757,Associations between maternal concern about child's weight and related behaviours and maternal weight-related parenting practices: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Parents influence their children's weight-related behaviours through their parenting practices, which are often a focal point of obesity prevention interventions. This study examined associations of maternal concern about their child's weight, dietary intake, physical activity, and media use with maternal food, physical activity, and media parenting practices. Methods: Mothers (n = 310) reported their level of concern regarding their child's weight and related behaviours and their weight-related parenting practices when their child was 5 years of age as part of the Melbourne Infant Feeding Activity and Nutrition Trial (InFANT) Program. We used linear regression analyses with estimation by generalized estimating equations to examine associations of maternal concern and maternal parenting practices. Results: Slightly more than 60% of mothers reported at least one concern related to their children's weight or related behaviours. Excessive media use was the most commonly endorsed concern among mothers (45.2%). Compared to mothers who were unconcerned about their child's weight, mothers who were concerned about their child weighing too much reported higher levels of controlling feeding practices, i.e., restrictive feeding, lower levels of co-participation of physical activity, and higher levels of using media to control child behaviour. Mothers who were concerned their child weighed too little reported higher levels of controlling feeding practices, i.e., restrictive feeding, pressure to eat. Similarly, mothers who were concerned about their child's eating (eating too much or too little) reported higher levels of controlling feeding practices. Mothers who were concerned about their child using too much media reported higher levels of using media to regulate their child's behaviour and providing opportunities for their child to use media. Conclusion: Mothers who were concerned about their child's weight, dietary intake, physical activity and media use reported higher levels of controlling parenting practices, i.e., pressure to eat, and lower levels of health promoting parenting practices, i.e., co-participation in physical activity. Longitudinal research is needed to elucidate temporal order and specific mechanisms of these associations. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","Haines, J. and Downing, K. L. and Tang, L. and Campbell, K.

The main objective of this research proposal is to describe an ongoing research project that focuses on associations between maternal executive function and the quality of mother‚Äìinfant interaction when the mother has a history of substance abuse. We will also investigate the effects of multiple variables, including maternal relationship experiences, personality disposition, parental stress, comorbid mental illness, and addiction severity, on the dyadic interaction and child functioning. A group of 40‚Äì50 mothers with substance abuse problems and their infants aged 6‚Äì18 months will be included. The mothers will be assessed with neuropsychological tests, clinical interviews, self-administered questionnaires, and dyadic interaction observations as well as observation and assessment of child functioning. We will use a cross-sectional correlational design. The inclusion of the participants will end in October 2015.

763,Fathers and their children's health: A telephone interview study,"Objective: To study fathers' perception of, and involvement in, their children's health. Design: Telephone interviews according to a structured guide. Setting: County of Sk√•ne, Sweden. Main outcome measures: Answers regarding care and upbringing of child, child's health and ill health, and role of father. Subjects: 237 fathers of small children. Results: Fathers seem to be involved in their children to a large extent, both in caring and playing activities with their children. Most of them (82%) think that the child's health is good, and half of them (55%) have, at some time, contacted a doctor. The fathers mention security, love and commitment as important factors for being a good father, and almost all (97%) think that they are good fathers. Yet, only slightly more than half of them (54%) state that they have sufficient time for the child. Conclusions: Today, fathers are subject to quite different expectations to participate actively in their children's everyday life than was the case for previous generations. Therefore, more studies of fathers' involvement in their children are needed, as well as a new approach within the health care system to fathers' participation. ¬© 2007 The Author(s).","Hallberg, A.

764,Human milk and breastfeeding: An intervention to mitigate toxic stress,"The American Academy of Nursing has identified toxic stress in childhood as a health policy concern of high priority. Adult diseases (e.g., obesity, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease) should be viewed as developmental disorders that begin early in life that could be reduced with the alleviation of toxic stress in childhood. The provision of human milk/breastfeeding is an evidence-based intervention that may hold the greatest potential to mitigate the effects of toxic stress from the moment of birth. Assisting families to make an informed choice to initiate and continue breastfeeding from birth has the potential to address both the disparity in the quality of nutrition provided infants and the economic stress experienced by families who purchase formula. The Expert Panel on Breastfeeding endorses initiatives to improve the initiation, duration, and exclusivity of breastfeeding to mitigate the effects of toxic stress in this call to action for research to build the evidence to support these critical relationships. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Hallowell, S.

Analysis of the data shows that, as suggested earlier (see XIII: 2760), pressure stimulation of the bladder, whether from its own condition or indirectly from colon and rectum, is the most probable cause of T. Although T was a common occurrence for all infants, marked individual differences appeared in frequency, duration, and behavior accompanying T.

The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using the Still Face Paradigm to measure mother interactive style, infant affect and emotional regulation in a rural Ecuador setting. Methods Infant‚Äôs emotional regulation and the quality of mother‚Äôs interaction were measured with the Still Face Paradigm at 4¬†months of age (¬±15¬†days). Twenty-four infants and their mothers were assessed in their home. Mother interactive style was coded for attention seeking and contingent responding. Emotional regulation was described by change in infant affect between Still Face episodes. Results A significant difference was found for infant affect between the five Still Face episodes (F1,118¬†=¬†9.185, p¬†=¬†0.003). A significant negative correlation was found for infant affect between episode 3 and 2 with attention seeking mother interactive style during episode 3 (rho¬†=¬†‚àí0.44, p¬†=¬†0.03), indicating that mothers using more contingent-responding interactions had infants with more positive affect. Conversely, a significant positive association was found for infant affect between episode 3 and 2 and contingent responding mother interactive style during episode 3 (rho¬†=¬†0.46, p¬†=¬†0.02), indicating that mothers who used more attention seeking play had infants who showed less positive affect. Conclusion for Practice Study results demonstrate feasibility in using the Still Face Paradigm in working populations residing in a rural region in Ecuadorian highlands and may be feasible in other similar populations in Latin America, and as a successful approach to measuring maternal-child interactions within a field-based epidemiological study design. ¬© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Handal, A.

772,Non-nutritive sucking habits in sleeping infants,"Background: Pacifier use has been postulated to decrease the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The responsible mechanisms are, however, unclear. Objectives: Since little is known about the non-nutritive sucking (NNS) habits of infants during sleep, we investigated NNS patterns and changes of physiological parameters during NNS in sleeping infants. Methods: Polygraphic recordings were performed in 12 infants with a median age of 55 days (range 7-82) who regularly used a pacifier during sleep. Episodes of active suckling (bursts) and quiescent periods were differentiated by video observations. We evaluated the time of suckling in relation to the total time of pacifier use, the median number of bursts per min, the median duration of single bursts and the median interval between 2 sequent bursts. In 48 randomly selected bursts, we additionally analyzed changes in heart rate, respiratory frequency and oxygen saturation compared to the 10-second period preceding the burst. Results: Median sleep time with a pacifier held in mouth was 31.3 min (13.0-117.6), of which 15.5% (6.4-36.7%) was spent with active suckling. The median number of bursts per min was 2.2 (1.2-4.5). The median duration of a burst was 3 s (1-22) and the median interval between 2 bursts was 10 s (1-1,434). Heart rate, respiratory frequency and oxygen saturation did not change significantly during suckling bursts. Conclusions: This pilot study presents important data for sucking habits in pacifier users which may provide a basis for further investigations concerning the efficacy of pacifiers in SIDS prophylaxis.

773,The analgesic effect of sucrose in full term infants: a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of different sucrose concentrations on measures of neonatal pain. DESIGN: Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial of sterile water (control) or one of three solutions of sucrose--namely, 12.5%, 25%, and 50% wt/vol. SETTING: Postnatal ward. PATIENTS: 60 healthy infants of gestational age 37-42 weeks and postnatal age 1-6 days randomised to receive 2 ml of one of the four solutions on to the tongue two minutes before heel prick sampling for serum bilirubin concentrations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Duration of crying over the first three minutes after heel prick. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in overall crying time and heart rate after three minutes in the babies given 50% sucrose as compared with controls. This was maximal one minute after heel prick in the 50% sucrose group and became statistically significant in the 25% sucrose group at two minutes. There was a significant trend for a reduction in crying time with increasing concentrations of sucrose over the first three minutes. CONCLUSION: Concentrated sucrose solution seems to reduce crying and the autonomic effects of a painful procedure in healthy normal babies. Sucrose may be a useful and safe analgesic for minor procedures in neonates.","Haouari, N. and Wood, C. and Griffiths, G. and Levene, M.",0,610

776,The utility of follow-up skeletal surveys in child abuse,"OBJECTIVE: Follow-up skeletal surveys (FUSS) are performed frequently in cases of possible physical abuse based on the evidence from small retrospective cohorts. Our objective was to determine the proportion of FUSS that identified new information in a large, multicenter population of children with concerns of physical abuse. METHODS: This was a prospective secondary analysis of an observational study of all children <10 years of age (120 months) who underwent evaluation for possible physical abuse by 20 US child abuse teams. This analysis included all children in whom FUSS was recommended and measured rates of FUSS completion, results of FUSS, and the change in perceived likelihood of abuse before and after FUSS. RESULTS: Among 2890 children enrolled in the Examining Siblings To Recognize Abuse research network, 2049 underwent skeletal survey and 796 (38.8%) had FUSS. A total of 174 (21.5%) subjects had new information identified by FUSS, including 124 (15.6%) with at least 1 new fracture and 55 (6.9%) with reassuring findings compared with the initial skeletal survey. Among cases with new fractures, the estimated likelihood of abuse increased in 41 (33%) cases, and 51 cases (41%) remained at the maximum likelihood of abuse. CONCLUSIONS: FUSS identified new information and affected the perceived likelihood of abuse in a substantial fraction of cases in which it was completed. These data support existing guidelines and, in addition, suggest that FUSS should be considered in cases with lower initial levels of concern for abuse.","Harper, N.

777,Clinical signs associated with Triple Antigen (DTP) vaccination in infants,"Objective: The perceived reactogenicity of pertussis‚Äêcontaining vaccines is of considerable public health importance. The purpose of this study was to establish prospectively the incidence of systemic and local clinical signs associated with the first three doses of the diphtheria‚Äêtetanus‚Äêpertussis vaccine (DTP) currently used in Australia. In addition, in order to determine whether variability in reporting of such phenomena might be associated with variation in DTP batches, infant behaviour was studied with three batches for the first of the three DTP vaccinations. Methodology : Double blind, randomized controlled trial. There were 591 eligible infants who were recruited sequentially from centres for vaccination in three large Melbourne municipalities, of whom 531 (mean age 10 weeks, 45% female) were randomized and immunized. Of 181 subjects who received DTP from batch 1, 151 were studied at the time of their second DTP dose, and 98 at the third. Infants were assigned randomly to receive one of three batches of DTP vaccine. Parents were provided with a thermometer and a clinical sign diary. Research nurses visited the home 24 h after vaccination, and telephoned 7 days after vaccination to record local and systemic signs. Results There was no significant variation between DTP batches in rates of local or systemic signs. At the time of the first vaccination, the rates of local signs were: redness 16%, induration 29%, swelling 46%, and tenderness 54%. Systemic signs included: irritability 93%, intermittent inconsolable crying 43%, and persistent crying 12%. An axillary temperature of greater than 38¬∞C was recorded in 13% (Cl 9‚Äì19%) of babies following the first immunization, 20% (Cl 14‚Äì27%) following the second, and 14% (Cl 8‚Äì23%) following the third immunization. There were significant reductions in the rates of observed signs over the immunization course for diarrhoea, irritability, intermittent inconsolable crying and persistent crying. Conclusions There is little difference in the rates of clinical signs or presumed minor adverse effects associated with the DTP vaccine used in Australia today compared to that used 10 years ago, despite increases in the diphtheria and tetanus toxoid concentration, and the addition of aluminium phosphate adjuvant. Rates are comparable to those for other DTP vaccines manufactured in North America and Europe. Copyright ¬© 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

778,Effect of a responsive parenting intervention on child emotional overeating is mediated by reduced maternal use of food to soothe: The INSIGHT RCT,"Background: Child emotional overeating is a risk factor for obesity that is learned in the home environment. Parents' use of food to soothe child distress may contribute to the development of children's emotional overeating. Objectives: To examine the effect of a responsive parenting (RP) intervention on mother-reported child emotional overeating, and explore whether effects are mediated by mother-reported use of food to soothe child distress. Methods: The sample included primiparous mother-infant dyads randomized to a RP intervention (n = 105) or home safety control group (n = 102). Nurses delivered RP guidance in four behavioral domains: sleeping, fussy, alert/calm, and drowsy. Mothers reported their use of food to soothe at age 18 months and child emotional overeating at age 30 months. Mediation was analyzed using the SAS PROCESS macro. Results: RP intervention mothers reported less frequent use of food to soothe and perceived their child's emotional overeating as lower compared to the control group. Food to soothe mediated the RP intervention effect on child emotional overeating (mediation model: R2 = 0.13, P '.0001). Conclusions: Children's emotional overeating may be modified through an early life RP intervention. Teaching parents alternative techniques to soothe child distress rather than feeding may curb emotional overeating development to reduce future obesity risk. ¬© 2020 World Obesity Federation","Harris, H.

781,Repeated doses of sucrose in infants continue to reduce procedural pain during prolonged hospitalizations,"Background: The efficacy of oral sucrose in the reduction of single episodes of acute procedural pain in newborn infants has been demonstrated in a large number of well-conducted randomized controlled trials. However, there are few studies that have examined the effectiveness of repeated doses of sucrose and there are no studies of prolonged sucrose use in sick infants over an entire period of hospitalization. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effectiveness of repeated doses of oral sucrose during heel lancing in sick infants over the course of a prolonged hospitalization. Methods: A prospective longitudinal cohort study was conducted in a tertiary referral neonatal intensive care unit. Infants with a predicted length of stay of ‚â•28 days were eligible for inclusion. Oral sucrose was administered prior to and during all heel lance procedures observed. Pain outcomes consisted of facial expression scores, crying duration, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Changes in sequential pain responses were analyzed, and weighted linear regression slopes for all assessed parameters were calculated to estimate the average regression slope. Results: There were 55 infants enrolled, and 443 pain assessments during heel lancing were conducted. Behavioral responses to heel lancing were predominantly low, and there were minimal changes in behavioral and physiological parameters to successive heel lance procedures. The mean weighted regression slope over the period of hospitalization for the facial expression scores upon heel lance, on the 0-4 scale, was -0.0084 (AD  - School of Nursing, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia denise.harrison@utoronto.ca","Harrison, Denise and Loughnan, Peter and Manias, Elizabeth and Gordon, lan and Johnston, Linda",0,616
783,Potential determinants during ‚Äòthe first 1000 days of life‚Äô of sleep problems in school-aged children,"Study objectives: Early life determinants of sleep problems are mostly unknown. The first 1000 days of life (ie, the time between conception and a child's second birthday) is a period where the foundations for optimum health, growth and neurodevelopment are established. The aim of this explorative study is to identify potential early life determinants of sleep problems at age 7‚Äì8 years. Methods: Data from the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development cohort study (n = 2746) were analyzed. Sleep problems at age 7‚Äì8 years were reported by the caregiver in the ‚ÄòChild Sleep Habits Questionnaire‚Äô. A higher total score indicates more sleep problems. After multiple imputation (n = 20), we studied multivariable associations between all potential determinants and sleep problems using regression analysis. Results: A higher pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was associated with more sleep problems at age 7‚Äì8 years [Œ≤ 0.12 (95% CI 0.05, 0.18)]. Children of mothers with symptoms of anxiety during pregnancy [Œ≤ 0.06 (95% CI 0.03, 0.09)] and infancy period [Œ≤ 0.04 (95% CI 0.00, 0.07)] had more sleep problems. Children of mothers drinking ‚â•1 glass of alcohol a day around 14 weeks of gestation had a 2 points higher sleep problem score [Œ≤ 2.55 (95% CI 0.21, 4.89)] and children of mothers smoking ‚â•1 cigarette per day in that period had a one point higher score [Œ≤ 1.07 (95% CI 0.10, 2.03)]. Infants with relative weight loss (delta BMI-SD) had a higher sleep problem score during childhood [Œ≤ ‚àí0.32 (95%CI -0.60, ‚àí0.04)]. Conclusions: We identified several potential determinants during pregnancy and infancy associated with childhood sleeping problems. We encourage further research into these and other potential determinants to replicate results and to identify underlying mechanisms. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Harskamp-van Ginkel, M. W. and Kool, R.

784,Storage and use of Newborn Screening Blood Specimens for Research: Assessing Public Opinion in Illinois,"Storage and use of residual dried blood spots (DBS) from newborn screening (NBS) for research purposes has been a topic of elevated interest following high profile disputes between genetic privacy advocacy groups and state NBS programs. Our objective was to assess public opinion in Illinois regarding storage and use of residual DBS for research. Five hundred twenty-six Illinois residents completed a survey assessing attitudes about research uses for DBS, storage length, and consent issues. Over 80¬†% of respondents expressed agreement with questions regarding research uses of DBS. Eighty-three percent of respondents were in favor of storage for at least one¬†year with 44¬†% favoring indefinite storage. Respondents with higher educational attainment were more likely to support research use of DBS and less likely to desire contact for each future study (P < 0.05). Black respondents were less likely than white respondents to express agreement for the use of DBS for research or to favor long-term storage (P < 0.05). Support was high for storage and use of DBS in our sample. Consent was important and respondents wanted choices about participation. Forty-two percent of respondents were not aware of NBS prior to this survey, highlighting a need for greater education about this public health program. Trust in the public health service of NBS must be protected through transparency in the policy process. ¬© 2014, National Society of Genetic Counselors, Inc.","Hart, A. and Petros, M. and Charrow, J. and Nash, C. and Wicklund, C.",0,618
785,Pain assessment following general anesthesia using the Toddler Preschooler Postoperative Pain Scale: a comparative study,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the reliability of the Toddler Preschooler Postoperative Pain Scale (TPPS) following general anesthesia as a guide to analgesic administration, and to compare the validity of this scale with other observational measures of pain in children. DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive, single-blinded observational study. SETTING: Operative and radiology suites at a community hospital. PATIENTS: 51 ASA physical status I and II patients aged 1 to 5 years requiring general anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: Patients emerging from general anesthesia following elective otolaryngology, urology, and nonpainful radiology procedures were observed. Persons caring for the children were blinded as to the purpose of the observers. The observers recorded pain scores during recovery, before and after analgesic administration and at discharge. MEASUREMENTS: The TPPS was used in three sequential stages. The initial stage (n = 20) examined pain scores from emergence through discharge from hospital following myringotomy, adenoidectomy, or tonsillectomy. The second stage compared these pain scores to those observed on emergence from nonpainful diagnostic radiologic procedures (n = 11) and patients receiving caudal analgesia following urological procedures (n = 8). The third stage studied the clinical utility of the TPPS in comparison to the face, legs, activity, crying, consolability (FLACC) scale and a modified COMFORT scale using simultaneous measurements (n = 12). MAIN RESULTS: TPPS scores varied in a categorical fashion with the intensity of pain and significantly decreased following opioid administration. All three scales reliably demonstrated pain reduction following opioid administration. Initial TPPS scores tended to be lower in patients who did not require treatment for pain. CONCLUSIONS: Following procedures that are likely to produce pain, TPPS, FLACC, and the COMFORT scale, modified as a purely behavioral tool, can be recommended for postoperative assessment of patients aged 1 to 5 years. The TPPS may be preferred for the discrimination between painful and nonpainful states.","Hartrick, C. T. and Kovan, J. P.",0,619
786,A causal analysis of kitten vocalization: An observational and experimental study,"Observation of 8 kitten litters under seminatural conditions revealed that maternal and littermate behaviors were associated with increases or decreases in the probability of kitten vocalization. Experimental study, in which Ss were exposed to cold, restraint, and isolation during the 1st 6 wks of life, revealed differences in the rate of vocalization across weeks and across stimulus conditions. Analyses of peak fundamental frequency, duration of cry units, and peak amplitude of S vocalizations showed significant differences across either stimulus conditions or weeks. Results are discussed with reference to development of physiological mechanisms such as homoiothermy, to crucial changes in the litter situation, and to the vocalization's role in affecting mother‚Äìinfant relations.

Discrimination function analysis found that mothers who were anxious prior to DPT administration and who had infant girls were more likely to contact the clinic by telephone. This relationship was independent of prior maternal experience with DPT immunization, maternal perception of the infant's general fussiness, and maternal Trait anxiety.

790,Sucrose decreases infant biobehavioral pain response to immunizations: a randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the effectiveness and age-related changes in analgesia of oral sucrose as a preprocedural intervention during routine immunizations in infants at 2 and 4 months of age. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 40 healthy term infants scheduled to receive routine immunizations from a pediatric ambulatory care clinic during May 2005 to July 2005. METHODS: Infants received 24% oral sucrose solution or the control solution of sterile water 2 minutes before routine immunizations at both their 2- and 4-month, well-child visits. The University of Wisconsin Children's Hospital pain scale was used to measure serial acute behavioral pain responses at baseline, 2, and 5 minutes after administration of the solution. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine between-group differences and within-subject variability of the effects of treatment on overall behavioral pain scores. FINDINGS: Infants receiving oral sucrose (n=20) showed a significant reduction in behavioral pain response 5 minutes after administration compared to those in the placebo group (n=20). At 2 minutes following solution administration, both sucrose and sterile water showed the highest mean pain score (4.54 and 4.39 respectively) indicating a severe amount of pain. At 5 minutes, the sucrose group returned to near normal at 0.27 while the placebo group remained at 3.02 indicating a percentage difference in mean pain scores relative to sterile water pain scores of 90.9. No statistically significant age-related change in behavioral pain response was noted between 2- and 4-month-old infants at 2 minutes and 5 minutes following treatment administration. CONCLUSION: Sucrose is an effective preprocedural intervention for decreasing behavioral pain response in infants after immunizations. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Efforts to decrease the pain associated with immunizations can promote parental adherence to recommended immunizations schedules, prevent a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases and mitigate adverse neurologic outcomes in infants.","Hatfield, L.

791,Infant sleeping arrangements and practices during the first year of life,"OBJECTIVES. Our goal was to examine the sleeping arrangements for infants from birth to 1 year of age and to assess the association between such arrangements and maternal characteristics. METHODS. Responses to the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month questionnaires from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II were analyzed to assess sleep arrangements, including bed sharing, the latter defined as mother ever (in a given time frame) slept with the infant on the same sleeping surface for nighttime sleep. Women were also asked about the reasons for bed sharing or not bed sharing. RESULTS. Approximately 2300 women responded at 3 months, and 1800 at 12 months. At 3 months, 85% of the infants slept in the same room as their mother, and at 12 months that rate was 29%. At 3 months, 26% of the mothers did not use the recommended supine position for their infant's nighttime sleep. The rate of noncompliance increased to 29% by 6 months and 36% by 12 months. The bed-sharing rates were 42% at 2 weeks, 34% at 3 months, and 27% at 12 months. Approximately two thirds of those who bed shared with their infant also shared the bed with their husband or partner, and 5% to 15% shared it with other children. The major reasons for bed sharing were to calm a fussy infant, facilitate breastfeeding, and help the infant and/or mother sleep better. The major reasons for not lying down with the infant were safety concerns. Non-Hispanic black mothers were more likely than non-Hispanic white mothers to use nonsupine infant sleep positions and to bed share. CONCLUSIONS. More than one third of the women in this cohort were noncompliant with safe-sleeping guidelines when their infant was 3 months old. Health care providers need to advise parents of current recommendations and discuss the risks and benefits of their choices for infant sleeping practices.","Hauck, F. R. and Signore, C. and Fein, S.

794,Preregistration in infant research‚ÄîA primer,"Preregistration, the act of specifying a research plan in advance, is becoming more common in scientific research. Infant researchers contend with unique problems that might make preregistration particularly challenging. Infants are a hard-to-reach population, usually yielding small sample sizes, they can only complete a limited number of trials, and they can be excluded based on hard-to-predict complications (e.g., parental interference, fussiness). In addition, as effects themselves potentially change with age and population, it is hard to calculate an a priori effect size. At the same time, these very factors make preregistration in infant studies a valuable tool. A priori examination of the planned study, including the hypotheses, sample size, and resulting statistical power, increases the credibility of single studies and adds value to the field. Preregistration might also improve explicit decision making to create better studies. We present an in-depth discussion of the issues uniquely relevant to infant researchers, and ways to contend with them in preregistration and study planning. We provide recommendations to researchers interested in following current best practices. ¬© 2020 International Congress of Infant Studies (ICIS)","Havron, N. and Bergmann, C. and Tsuji, S.",0,628

796,Responses of six-month-olds to the distress of their peers,"Observations of 12 pairs of 6-mo-olds interacting in a laboratory playroom in the presence of both mothers indicated that the estimated frequency, duration, and temporal distribution on 1 S's distressed vocalizations were statistically independent of those of the peer. The absence of toys in the environment was a reliable predictor of the extent of S's distress, whereas the peer's estimated frequency and duration of distress and S's own gender and locomotor status were not. Ss watched their distressed peers during a majority of distress episodes and occasionally directed other behaviors to them but only rarely became distressed themselves. However, there were some indications in the pattern of distress in the trial when toys were absent that suggest S's distress had cumulative effects on the peer. It is suggested that such cumulative effects would be tempered by environmental conditions and the reactions of caregivers.

Complex pain in young children can impact the quality of life through limiting physical and social development, compromising psychological well-being, and disrupting sleep. The aim of this review is to identify the needs of young children who present to a tertiary-level pain service, what services they require, and their treatment outcomes. There are limited data on this vulnerable population, which may be due to small numbers represented and the complexities of pain assessment in this age group. Method.

801,The role of auditory stimuli in crying inhibition in the neonate,"An experiment on the latency and duration of the cessation of spontaneous crying supported evidence that a low frequency intense auditory stimulus inhibits crying in neonates. There was a slight increase in the length of the first pause in crying during exposure to a 200-c/s tone, but no difference in the latency of this first pause. Since crying intensity reaches 80 db SPL at the infant ear, it is hypothesized that auditory stimuli juxtaposed during crying is in fact masked. Hence to be effective, an auditory stimulus must be presented at the beginning of a natural pause in crying. An experiment on rhythm in cry patterns did not support the hypothesis that crying may be a naturally rhythmic pattern of behavior analogous to sucking and susceptible to psychophysical investigation. There was a large variance within and between Ss for the mean latency and duration of cry bursts and pauses. Exper. III asked mothers with infants of 10 days, 7 weeks, and 13 weeks of age to keep a crying activity schedule in their own homes. This study revealed a discontinuity between neonates and older infants in the conditions and patterns of crying. Interview data did indicate that reliable positive orienting responses did occur to natural auditory stimuli in a naturalistic setting.","Hazlewood, V.",0,635

Design: Cross-sectional, mixed methods study. Setting: Caregivers and health-care providers were recruited from 3 academic craniofacial centers and national advertisements. Most interviews were conducted by telephone, and surveys were completed online. Participants: Caregivers had a child less than 3 years of age with CL¬±P and spoke either English or Spanish. Health-care providers were members of a cleft team. Caregivers (n = 492) and health-care professionals (n = 75) participated in at least one component of this study. Main Outcome Measure(s): Caregivers and health-care providers participated in tasks related to instrument development: concept elicitation for items within relevant health domains, prioritization of items, and item review. Results: We identified 295 observations of infant well-being across 9 health areas. Research staff and specialists evaluated items for clarity, specificity to CL¬±P, and responsiveness to treatment.

809,Examining the effects of an eHealth intervention from infant age 6 to 12 months on child eating behaviors and maternal feeding practices one year after cessation: The Norwegian randomized controlled trial Early Food for Future Health,"Objectives The Norwegian randomized controlled trial Early Food for Future Health provided parental anticipatory guidance on early protective feeding practices from child age 6 to 12 months through an eHealth intervention. Previously published outcomes at child age 12 months indicated that the eHealth intervention increased daily vegetable/fruit intake and promoted more beneficial mealtime routines. The objective of the current paper is to evaluate the effects of the intervention at child age 24 months, one year after cessation. Methods Parents of infants aged 3-5 months were recruited via social media and child health clinics during spring 2016. At child age 5.5 months, 715 mothers were randomized to either control (n = 358) or intervention (n = 360) arm. Primary study-outcomes were child eating behaviors, dietary intake, mealtime routines and maternal feeding practices and feeding styles. Secondary outcome was child anthropometry. Results In total 295 mothers (41%) completed the follow-up questionnaire at child age 24 months. Regarding fruit intake, 54.3% in the intervention group had a high score compared with 48.3% of the control group (p = 0.29). For intake of vegetables, 54.5% in the intervention group had a high score compared with 50.7% in the control group (p = 0.49). A total of 65.7% of the children in the intervention group were eating breakfast together with family . 4 times per week, compared with 57.3% of the children in the control group (p = 0.12). There was no difference between the groups for child anthropometric outcomes at child age 24 months. Conclusions At child age 24 months, we found no evidence of sustained intervention-effects. Although dietary patterns and mealtime routines at child age 24 months were reasonably consistent and in the same directions as at child age 12 months, the between-group differences were not significant. The large loss to follow-up may have limited power and validity and makes it difficult to draw overall conclusions. Future research is needed to improve knowledge of how short-time effects could be retained over longer term, taking into account that larger samples are necessary when planning longer-term follow-up studies.

810,Evaluation of an eHealth intervention aiming to promote healthy food habits from infancy -the Norwegian randomized controlled trial Early Food for Future Health,"Background: Strategies to optimize early-life nutrition provide an important opportunity for primary prevention of childhood obesity. Interventions that can be efficiently scaled-up to the magnitude needed for sustainable childhood obesity prevention are needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of an eHealth intervention on parental feeding practices and infant eating behaviors. Methods: The Norwegian study Early Food for Future Health is a randomized controlled trial. Parents were recruited via social media and child health clinics during spring 2016 when their child was aged 3 to 5 months. In total 718 parents completed a web-based baseline questionnaire at child age 5.5 months. The intervention group had access to a webpage with monthly short video clips addressing specific infant feeding topics and age-appropriate baby food recipes from child age 6 to 12 months. The control group received routine care. The primary outcomes were child eating behaviors, dietary intake, mealtime routines and maternal feeding practices and feeding styles. The secondary outcomes were child anthropometry. This paper reports outcomes at child age 12 months. Results: More than 80% of the intervention group reported viewing all/most of the video clips addressing infant feeding topics and indicated that the films were well adapted to the child's age and easy to understand. Children in the intervention group were served vegetables/fruits more frequently (p = 0.035) and had tasted a wider variety of vegetables (p = 0.015) compared to controls. They were also more likely to eat family breakfast (p = 0.035) and dinner (p = 0.011) and less likely to be playing or watching TV/tablet during meals (p = 0.009) compared to control-group children. We found no group differences for child anthropometry or maternal feeding practices. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the eHealth intervention is an appropriate and feasible tool to propagate information on healthy infant feeding to Norwegian mothers. Our study also suggests that anticipatory guidance on early protective feeding practices by such a tool may increase young children's daily vegetable/fruit intake and promote beneficial mealtime routines.

811,Mothers' mood and infant feeding: Prediction of problems and practices,"Examined relationships between women's mood, their perception of feeding difficulties, and their chosen feeding practices for their babies. Anxiety and depression measures were given to 152 pregnant women (aged 16‚Äì40 yrs) in the 1st and 2nd trimesters of pregnancy, within a week of delivery, and a few months later. Ss completed a questionnaire about their babies' feeding several months after delivery. Maternal mood at all 3 times of measurement was significantly associated with feeding problems and practices. Ss who were relatively depressed in pregnancy had more physical difficulties with breast-feeding. Ss who were anxious after delivery perceived their babies as fussy, hungry, and demanding, and worried about the amount of food their babies brought back up. These perceived problems appeared to affect Ss' feeding practices. They stopped breast-feeding and introduced solids at a younger age.

812,Help in times of crying: Nurses' approach to parents with colicky infants,"Background. Colic, a condition that is well known to parents and nurses working in child health centres, is characterized by excessive crying. However, the criteria for defining colic are vague, there is no agreed definition and no effective treatment exists. Even though there is no cure for colic, nurses in child health centres have to deal with the condition as parents bring their crying infants to them. Aim. To develop an understanding of how nurses deal with infant colic/excessive crying, how the parents perceive nurses' contribution, and whether nursing makes a difference to the situation or not. Ethical issues and approval. The project was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee in Norway where the study was carried out. Methods. The design is explorative, and data were collected through qualitative in-depth interviews with nurses and parents of crying infants. The analysis follows the guidelines of Kvale, which imply a phenomenological/hermeneutical mode of understanding. Findings. The primary aim of nursing is to assist parents in their efforts to cope with the challenges of infant colic. Nurses and parents differ to some extent in how they define the problems and the needs of the families. In addition, both parents and nurses question the nurses' knowledge and ability to help in this situation. A relationship with the parents based on trust is fundamental to enable the nurses to achieve their goals, but such a relationship is not always developed. Conclusions. Even though nursing interventions do not cure infant colic, the amount of crying may be reduced and life made easier for the families if the parents are offered help in coping with the situation. Consequently, this should be the primary aim of nursing when approaching families with a colicky infant.","Helseth, S.",0,644
813,A comprehensive definition of infant colic: Parents' and nurses' perspectives,"‚Ä¢ Colic is a term that is often used for crying in infancy. There is no unified definition, the aetiology is disputed and there is no effective method of treatment. Therefore, the crying infant constitutes a problem for parents and for nurses in child health clinics. ‚Ä¢ The purpose of the study was to develop a clinically acceptable framework for describing colic. ‚Ä¢ The design is exploratory, and data were collected through qualitative in-depth interviews with nurses and parents of crying babies. ‚Ä¢ The infants identified by parents and nurses had periods of crying or fussing for more than 3 hours a day, the crying occurring on more than 3 days in any 1 week and lasting for more than 3 weeks. Three categories of crying emerged (intense crying, non-specific fussing and crying, feeding-related crying) that presumably differ in aetiology. An overall definition of colic is proposed that incorporates these categories. ‚Ä¢ The proposed definition may function as a diagnostic tool for nurses when they encounter problems of infant crying. The definition provides nurses with clinical criteria that can guide data collection. More specific assessment and categorization of infant crying will be helpful for nurses in addressing problems of colic. ¬© 2002 Blackwell Science Ltd.","Helseth, S. and Begnum, S.",0,645
814,Analyzing temporal patterns of infant sleep and negative affective behavior: A comparison between different statistical models,"Objective: Variability in infant sleep and negative affective behavior (NAB) is a developmental phenomenon that has long been of interest to researchers and clinicians. However, analyses and delineation of such temporal patterns were often limited to basic statistical approaches, which may prevent adequate identification of meaningful variation within these patterns. Modern statistical procedures such as additive models may detect specific patterns of temporal variation in infant behavior more effectively. Method: Hundred and twenty-one mothers were asked to record different behaviors of their 4-44 weeks old healthy infants by diaries for three days consecutively. Circadian patterns as well as individual trajectories and day-to-day variability of infant sleep and NAB were modeled with generalized linear models (GLMs) including a linear and quadratic polynomial for time, a GLM with a polynomial of the 8th order, a GLM with a harmonic function, a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with a polynomial of the 8th order, a generalized additive model, and a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM). Results: The semi-parametric model GAMM was found to fit the data of infant sleep better than any other parametric model used. GLMM with a polynomial of the 8th order and GAMM modeled temporal patterns of infant NAB equally well, although the GLMM exhibited a slightly better model fit while GAMM was easier to interpret. Besides the well-known evening clustering in infant NAB we found a significant second peak in NAB around midday that was not affected by the constant decline in the amounts of NAB across the 3-day study period. Conclusion: Using advanced statistical procedures (GAMM and GLMM) even small variations and phenomena in infant behavior can be reliably detected. Future studies investigating variability and temporal patterns in infant variables may benefit from these statistical approaches. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Inc..","Hemmi, M.

817,Gene-environment interplay in parenting young children,"Early parenting is rooted in a complex social system where parental characteristics, contextual factors and child characteristics interact over time. A comprehensive study of early parenting should thus consider a variety of factors, including those associated with the infant so called child effects. Understanding such a complex developmental system is a daunting task, and behaviour‚Äìgenetic studies, because they are designed to test hypotheses regarding gene‚Äìenvironment processes, are very useful in that endeavour. In the past decade, studies using a variety of genetically informative designs, including twin, adoption, step-family and linkage (i.e., molecular) designs, have shed new light on early parenting and the nature of its association with child socio-emotional development. In this chapter, we review this emerging evidence. Specifically, the chapter examines and discusses environmental and genetic influences, as well as their interplay, on infant attachment and various parenting behaviours. Data pointing to child effects on parenting behaviours (i.e. gene‚Äìenvironment correlations) are reviewed, as well as evidence of parental influence on child outcomes and its possible mediation through child heritable characteristics. We discuss the significance of these findings for our understanding of the developmental role of early parenting. We conclude with a discussion of methodological concerns, gaps, and future directions regarding behaviour-genetics research in early parenting. ¬© Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.","Henry, J. and Boivin, M. and Tarabulsy, G.",0,649
818,Mealtime behavior among parents and their young children with food allergy,"Background Food allergies are increasingly prevalent in the pediatric population. Balancing allergen avoidance with the promotion of healthy eating behaviors can be challenging for families. Objective To characterize mealtime behaviors among parents of young children with food allergy. Methods Seventy-four parents of young children with food allergies (‚â§7 years of age) completed measures of mealtime behavior, perceptions of food allergy risk and severity, pediatric parenting stress, and food allergy‚Äìrelated quality of life. Mealtime behavior reports were compared with published data regarding typically developing children, young children with type 1 diabetes, and children with diagnosed feeding disorders (with or without related medical factors). Results Parents of young children with food allergies reported frequent mealtime concerns. Specifically, they reported significantly more mealtime behavioral concerns than typically developing peers, comparable mealtime behavioral concerns to young children with type 1 diabetes, and significantly fewer mealtime behavioral concerns than children with diagnosed feeding disorders. Parental mealtime concerns were positively correlated with other parent perceptions of food allergy, such as risk of allergen exposure, illness-related parenting stress, and food allergy‚Äìrelated quality of life. Conclusion Young children with food allergy and their parents are more likely to exhibit mealtime behavioral concerns than typically developing peers and their parents. Future research should investigate the effect of food allergies and maladaptive mealtime behaviors on children's nutrition to provide clinical guidelines for parents who may benefit from psychosocial and/or nutritional support. ¬© 2016 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","Herbert, L.

822,Large cohort study finds a statistically significant association between excessive crying in early infancy and subsequent ear symptoms,"Aim: The diagnosis of infantile colic is based on excessive crying. However, several causal factors can account for this disconcerting, nonspecific symptom. The main aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between excessive crying during the first 6 months of life and subsequent ear problems. Methods: Data from a cohort study of 26 983 Danish children were used. Mothers participated in four telephone interviews and one questionnaire and provided information on crying in the first 6 months of life and ear symptoms at the ages of 6 months, 18 months and 7 years. Results: There was a statistically significant association between excessive crying in infancy and subsequent ear symptoms. A gradual increase in subsequent ear problems was seen with increasing crying time at all the data collection times. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest a possible link between excessive crying and ear infections. Whether such a link is causal or due to common underlying factors is still unknown. We recommend thorough ear examinations in children with symptoms compatible with infantile colic. ¬© 2014 Foundation Acta P√¶diatrica.

823,The benefits of paid maternity leave for mothers' post-partum health and wellbeing: Evidence from an Australian evaluation,"This paper investigates the health effects of the introduction of a near universal paid parental leave (PPL) scheme in Australia, representing a natural social policy experiment. Along with gender equity and workforce engagement, a goal of the scheme (18 weeks leave at the minimum wage rate) was to enhance the health and wellbeing of mothers and babies. Although there is evidence that leave, especially paid leave, can benefit mothers' health post-partum, the potential health benefits of implementing a nationwide scheme have rarely been investigated. The data come from two cross-sectional surveys of mothers (matched on their eligibility for paid parental leave), 2347 mother's surveyed pre-PPL and 3268 post-PPL. We investigated the scheme's health benefits for mothers, and the extent this varied by pre-birth employment conditions and job characteristics. Overall, we observed better mental and physical health among mothers after the introduction of PPL, although the effects were small. Post-PPL mothers on casual (insecure) contracts before birth had significantly better mental health than their pre-PPL counterparts, suggesting that the scheme delivered health benefits to mothers who were relatively disadvantaged. However, mothers on permanent contracts and in managerial or professional occupations also had significantly better mental and physical health in the post-PPL group. These mothers were more likely to combine the Government sponsored leave with additional, paid, employer benefits, enabling a longer paid leave package post-partum. Overall, the study provides evidence that introducing paid maternity leave universally delivers health benefits to mothers. However the modest 18 week PPL provision did little to redress health inequalities. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Hewitt, B. and Strazdins, L. and Martin, B.",0,655
824,Validity of a family-centered approach for assessing infants' social-emotional wellbeing and their developmental context: A prospective cohort study,"Background: Family-centered care seems promising in preventive pediatrics, but evidence is lacking as to whether this type of care is also valid as a means to identify risks to infants' social-emotional development. We aimed to examine the validity of such a family-centered approach. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study. During routine well-child visits (2-15 months), Preventive Child Healthcare (PCH) professionals used a family-centered approach, assessing domains as parents' competence, role of the partner, social support, barriers within the care-giving context, and child's wellbeing for 2976 children as protective, indistinct or a risk. If, based on the overall assessment (the families were labeled as ""cases"", N = 87), an intervention was considered necessary, parents filled in validated questionnaires covering the aforementioned domains. These questionnaires served as gold standards. For each case, two controls, matched by child-age and gender, also filled in questionnaires (N = 172). We compared PCH professionals' assessments with the parent-reported gold standards. Moreover, we evaluated which domain mostly contributed to the overall assessment. Results: Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between PCH professionals' assessments and gold standards were overall reasonable (Spearman's rho 0.17-0.39) except for the domain barriers within the care-giving context. Scores on gold standards were significantly higher when PCH assessments were rated as ""at risk"" (overall and per domain).We found reasonable to excellent agreement regarding the absence of risk factors (negative agreement rate: 0.40-0.98), but lower agreement regarding the presence of risk factors (positive agreement rate: 0.00-0.67). An ""at risk"" assessment for the domain Barriers or life events within the care-giving context contributed most to being overall at risk, i.e. a case, odds ratio 100.1, 95%-confidence interval: 22.6 - infinity. Conclusion: Findings partially support the convergent validity of a family-centered approach in well-child care to assess infants' social-emotional wellbeing and their developmental context. Agreement was reasonable to excellent regarding protective factors, but lower regarding risk factors. ¬© The Author(s). 2017.","Hielkema, M. and De Winter, A. F. and Reijneveld, S. A.",0,656

Longitudinal evidence was collected from 62 mother‚Äìchild dyads, representative of all social classes. This evidence included home observations of maternal and child behavior at 4 yrs, a temperament questionnaire at 4 yrs, a questionnaire about infant temperament, and observational and interview measures at various stages from birth to 3 yrs of infant behavior and maternal characteristics. The findings suggest that infant and childhood temperament (especially the degree of infant fussiness) is highly predictive of physical noncompliance and that physical noncompliance is unrelated to maternal or demographic variables. A combination of maternal variables, including warmth, closeness, and verbal directiveness, both positive and negative, as well as child variables, was found to predict verbal noncompliance. Demographic variables, temperament, and maternal attitudes were found to predict passive noncompliance.

This case series supports the aetiological mechanism of an imbalanced autonomic nervous system, via somatovisceral reflexes secondary to regional cranial and spinal dysfunction. In addition, they provide support towards the birth process being a causative factor in the development of colic. Design: A case series. Setting: Private chiropractic practice. Subjects: The first case involved a 7-week-old male infant presenting with medically diagnosed colic, with associated reflux and disturbed sleep, all of which were persistent since birth. The second infant, aged 10 weeks, had suffered maternally diagnosed colic for approximately 1 month. Associated symptoms included some vomiting and asymmetry with breast-feeding. Both infants demonstrated many typical colic characteristics and had experienced birth trauma. Upper cervical, mid thoracic, sacroiliac and cranial dysfunction was recorded in both cases. Methods: Each infant received diversified paediatric chiropractic manipulation to the areas diagnosed as dysfunctional. Treatment was provided over a 3-week period, though the intensity differed for the two infants. Results: Complete resolution of all presenting symptoms was achieved in both instances. Conclusion: These cases suggest a possible association between birth trauma","Hipperson, A. J.",0,666
840,"Long-term mother and child mental health effects of a population-based infant sleep intervention: Cluster-randomized, controlled trial","OBJECTIVES. Maternal depression is an established risk for adverse child development. Two thirds of clinically significant depressive symptoms occur in mothers reporting an infant sleep problem. We aimed to determine the long-term effects of a behavioral intervention for infant sleep problems on maternal depression and parenting style, as well as on child mental health and sleep, when the children reached 2 years of age. METHODS. We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in well-child centers across 6 government areas of Melbourne, Australia. Participants included 328 mothers reporting an infant sleep problem at 7 months, drawn from a population sample (N = 739) recruited at 4 months. We compared the usual well-child care (n = 154) versus a brief behavior-modification program designed to improve infant sleep (n = 174) delivered by well-child nurses at ages 8 to 10 months and measured maternal depression symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale)","Hiscock, H. and Bayer, J.

842,Typology of emergent eating patterns in early childhood,"The stability of eating patterns from infancy through childhood is largely unknown. This study identified subgroups of children based on emergent eating patterns from ages 1 to 3. years and examined differences between groups in demographic, anthropometric and temperamental variables. We conducted secondary analyses of 262 boys and 225 girls from the Colorado Adoption Project. Three eating styles (Reactivity to Food, Predictable Appetite, Distractibility at Mealtime) and five temperaments were assessed at ages 1 and 3. years. Weight and height (length) were assessed on children and mothers. Correlations examined the stability of eating patterns, cluster analysis identified subgroups of emergent eating styles, and analysis of variance identified variables differentiating the derived subgroups. Eating styles were moderately stable over time, although all increased on average. Four subgroups were identified: Diet Expanding and Preference Establishing Eaters (37%), Emerging Reactive Tendency Eaters (23%), Emerging Food-Indifferent and Non-Fussy Eaters (31%), and Emerging High-Reactive and Fussy Eaters (9%). The subgroups differed in year 1 Wt/L and Reaction to Food, and year 1-to-3 changes in Emotionality and Reaction to Food. Four emergent eating patterns were identified. How these subgroups of children differ in later weight and health trajectories warrants research. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Hittner, J. B. and Faith, M. S.",0,668
843,"Infant emotional distress, maternal restriction at a home meal, and child BMI gain through age 6 years in the Colorado Adoption Project","Infant temperament and parental feeding practices may be risk factors for childhood obesity, however most studies have relied upon parent-report assessments. We tested whether infant emotional distress and maternal restrictive feeding at 12-months of age, assessed observationally at a home feeding interaction, predicted child BMI through age 6 years. We conducted a prospective observational study of 86 children (34 girls and 52 boys, from 55 adoptive and 31 non-adoptive families) enrolled in the Colorado Adoption Project. Mother-infant feeding interactions were video-recorded during a home snack or meal at year 1, and child anthropometrics (length or height, and weight) were assessed at years 1 through 6. The main outcome measures were child weight-for-length at year 1 and body mass index (BMI: kg/m2) at years 2-6. Results of generalized linear models indicated that greater infant emotional distress at 12-months predicted greater increases in child weight status through age 6 years, B = 0.62 and odds ratio (OR) = 1.87. In separate analyses, restrictive feeding interacted with child sex in predicting weight status trajectories (p =.012). Male infants whose mothers displayed any compared to no restriction at year 1 showed a downward BMI trajectory from 2 to 6 years","Hittner, J. B. and Johnson, C. and Tripicchio, G. and Faith, M.

844,Psychological functioning and predictors of father-infant relationship in IVF fathers and controls,"The psychological functioning of fathers with children born after in vitro fertilization (IVF) has received little attention. Among men in general, little is known about predictors of early father-infant relationship (here also defined as attachment). The first aim was to compare IVF fathers and control fathers regarding personality traits, state anxiety, depressive symptoms and early father-infant attachment. The second aim was to assess whether early father-infant relationship is explained by the father's prenatal relationship with the unborn infant, his personality traits, state anxiety and symptoms of depression. Fifty-three IVF fathers and 36 controls filled in self-rating scales measuring father-infant attachment, personality, anxiety and symptoms of depression at 2 months postpartum. At gestational week 26 their prenatal relationship to the unborn infant was assessed. It was found that IVF fathers rated more somatic and psychic anxiety, indirect aggression and less assertiveness. They were as strongly attached to their infant as the controls. Fathers, who had rated higher attachment to their unborn infant during pregnancy, who were less anxious, more assertive and less irritable, were more attached to their infants than men who had been less attached to their unborn infants and who were more anxious, less assertive and more irritable. In conclusion, although IVF fathers are as strongly attached to their infants as other fathers, they may benefit from emotional support as they have elevated levels of anxiety proneness and indirect aggression. It is important to pay attention during pregnancy to fathers who have a less optimal attachment to their unborn infant and who have high levels of anxiety and irritability, as those three factors are related to a weak emotional father-infant relationship.","Hjelmstedt, A. and Collins, A.",0,670
845,Intergenerational effects of childhood maltreatment and malnutrition on personality maladaptivity in a Barbadian longitudinal cohort,"Childhood adversities are linked with mental health problems throughout the life course, including personality pathology. Less is known about consequences in the next generation, particularly in non-Western populations. In the Barbados Nutrition Study, we assessed associations of two parental (G1) childhood adversities‚Äî (1) maltreatment history using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF), and (2) clinically ascertained infant malnutrition limited to the first year of life‚Äîon PD symptoms in their G2 offspring, using NEO FFM PD prototypes. In linear regression models clustered by family and adjusted for other G1 childhood adversities and family socioeconomic status, we found that G1 parental history of childhood maltreatment was significantly associated with increased G2 offspring Borderline, Histrionic, Narcissistic, and Dependent PD scores. When G1 childhood malnutrition was the exposure of interest, we found a significant association with Schizoid PD scores. When the sample was restricted to offspring of G1 mothers, even more extensive associations with G2 personality pathology were observed. This study supports a link between parental exposure to childhood adversities and increased personality maladaptivity in the next generation, with some specific patterns worthy of further exploration. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Hock, R.

In Study 1, 99 parents reported on themselves and their child with 5p‚Äì, as well as on family demographics, social supports, and stress. The best predictor of familial stress was the child's amount of maladaptive behavior, accounting for 12 to 38% of the variance across different stress measures. In Study 2, sibling concerns were examined in 44 unaffected siblings (aged 6‚Äì18 yrs). The major finding was that parents and siblings disagreed on the extent of the siblings' interpersonal concerns. Parents reported that siblings felt ignored and misunderstood, whereas siblings themselves rated these concerns at much lower levels.

F. Wohlwill's (1973) methodology of developmental functions. To elucidate the model further, three applications are given. The applications pertain to the development of children's sleeping duration during the first 18 months of life, the effects of early hospitalization on the daily frequency of crying, and the developmental relationship between social and solitary play.

850,Pacifier Use and Early Life Weight Outcomes in the Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories Study,"Background: Although widely used by infants, little is known about the long-term effects of pacifiers. We investigated relationships between pacifier use in infancy and appetite, temperament, feeding, and weight outcomes through age 2 years using data from the Intervention Nurses Start Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories study. Methods: Mother-newborn dyads were randomized to a responsive parenting intervention for obesity prevention or a control group. Infants with data on pacifier use (n = 250) were categorized as using a pacifier beyond early infancy (‚â•4 months of age) or not. Anthropometrics were measured at 6 months, 1, and 2 years with overweight defined as weight-for-length ‚â•95th percentile at 1 year and BMI ‚â•85th percentile at 2 years. Mothers completed questionnaires on temperament, appetite, and feeding. Results: Infants who used a pacifier at 4 months or later (68%) had greater conditional weight gain from birth to 6 months (p = 0.01), weight-for-length z-score at 1 year (p < 0.001), and BMI z-score at 2 years (p < 0.001) than infants who did not. Infants using a pacifier at ‚â•4 months were more likely to be overweight at ages 1 year (11.7% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.03) and 2 years (20.1% vs. 7.9%, p = 0.03). Pacifier use was associated with shorter breastfeeding duration and less responsive parent feeding styles, but these variables did not mediate the relationship between pacifiers and weight. Parent-reported temperament and appetite were unrelated to pacifier use. Conclusions: Pacifier use beyond early infancy is associated with accelerated infant growth and toddler overweight, although the reasons for this relationship are unclear. ¬© Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.","Hohman, E.

853,Maternal-infant interaction as an influence on infant adiposity,"Objectives: The aim of this research is to identify whether specific aspects of the early life psychosocial environment such as quality of home and maternal-infant interaction are associated with increased infant adiposity, in a disadvantaged population in the United States. METHODS: Data on 121 mother-infant pairs from the Albany Pregnancy and Infancy Lead Study were analyzed using three multiple linear regression models with subscapular skinfold thickness (SST), triceps skinfold thickness (TST), and weight z-scores at 12 months of age as outcome variables. Maternal-infant interaction was indexed by the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scales (NCATS) and home environment quality was indexed by the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (HOME). RESULTS: In models including infant birth weight, cigarette use in second trimester, infant caloric intake at 9‚Äì12 months, size at birth for gestational age, infant sex, and mother's prepregnancy BMI, specific subscales of NCATs predicted infant adiposity z-scores. Poorer mother's response to infant distress was associated with greater SST (Œí = ‚àí0.20, P =.02), TST (Œí = ‚àí0.19, P =.04), and weight (Œí = ‚àí0.14, P =.05). Better maternal sensitivity to infant cues was associated with larger SST (Œí = 0.25, P <.01), while mother's poorer social-emotional growth fostering predicted greater SST (Œí = ‚àí0.23, P <.01) and weight (Œí = ‚àí0.16, P =.03). Better scores on HOME Organization of the Environment were associated with greater SST (Œí = 0.34, P =.02) and TST (Œí = 0.33, P =.04). CONCLUSIONS: Emotionally relevant aspects of the maternal-infant interaction predicted infant adiposity, though in different directions. This indicates that the psychosocial environment, through maternal behavior, may influence infant adiposity. However, the general home environment was not consistently related to infant adiposity. ¬© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Holdsworth, E. A. and Schell, L. M.",0,678
854,The effect of chiropractic treatment on infantile colic: Study protocol for a single-blind randomized controlled trial,"Background: Infantile colic is a common condition during early childhood affecting around one of six newborns. The condition is characterized by inconsolable crying and fussing in otherwise healthy and thriving infants. The most used definition is excessive crying for at least three hours a day for at least three days for at least three weeks. The cause of colic is still unknown although many hypotheses and thereby many different treatment modalities have been investigated. Chiropractic care is used increasingly in treatment of infants, including for infantile colic, although the evidence worldwide is sparse. A randomized, controlled trial was designed to evaluate the effect of chiropractic treatment on infantile colic. This paper describes the protocol as well as results from a pilot study examining the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Method: The study is designed as a single-blind randomized, controlled trial. The invited families are residents on the Island of Funen and information about the project is distributed from the maternity wards and health visitors. Children at the age of 2-14 weeks with unexplained excessive crying are screened for eligibility and recruited by the primary investigator through home visits. Eligible children are then randomized to chiropractic treatment or control. All children attend in the chiropractor clinic two times a week for two weeks. The parents are unaware of their child's allocation during the project period. The primary outcome measure is change in daily hours of crying based on the parental diaries. The study intends to include 200 children, and the intervention has, during a pilot study, been found acceptable and feasible among families with newborns. Discussion: In a single-blind randomized controlled design we will evaluate the effectiveness of chiropractic treatment on infantile colic. The study will contribute to determine the effect of chiropractic treatment on infantile colic in an area where limited evidence exists. Furthermore, the study aims to explore if subgroups of children with suspected musculoskeletal problems will benefit more from the intervention than others. If they obtain better results, this could imply the need for stratified care. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","Holm, L. V. and Jarb√∏l, D. E. and Christensen, H.

Study design: We used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2006, to determine the prevalence of CBFF in both univariable and multivariable analyses. We examined breast-feeding duration using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses. Results: Among 6788 children ages 0-71 months, 8% were CBFF and 55% were exclusively breast-fed during the first week of life. Factors independently associated with CBFF were Hispanic ethnicity (adjusted OR, 3.81) and black race (adjusted OR, 2.59). CBFF was associated with decreased overall breast-feeding duration in the full cohort (P <.001) but not in the Hispanic or black subgroups. CBFF and formula-feeding, when compared with 4 months of exclusive breast-feeding, were associated with an increased risk for overweight/obesity between ages 2 and 6 years. Conclusions: In a nationally representative sample, CBFF is associated with shorter overall breast-feeding duration in white but not Hispanic or black mother-baby dyads. A significant number of US infants, though breast-fed, do not receive the health benefits of exclusive breast-feeding. Copyright ¬© 2011 Mosby Inc. All rights reserved.","Holmes, A.

The reasons for the importance of this type of medical supervision are discussed, and the factors that operate both in utero and in the first stages of a baby's life are given. The development of the metabolic phenotype as life begins and continues is explained, including the importance of symbiotic bacteria (the microbiome). The changing metabolic phenotyping in various conditions such as premature birth, maternal obesity, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and others is discussed in detail. Postnatal factors that influence ongoing health are then discussed in relation to metabolic processes.

The Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population experience significant disadvantage and adversity relative to the non-Aboriginal population, with disproportionate and increasing rates of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care and substantiated child maltreatment seven times the rates for non-Aboriginal children. Despite decades of resilience research there remains a gap in our understanding of the extent to which specific mechanisms and processes support resilient outcomes. This discussion paper synthesizes findings from our four previously published studies which together illustrate the application of a person-based resilience framework of analysis in the context of Western Australian Aboriginal youth. We discuss the implications of this approach for better understanding processes differentially impacting psychosocial functioning of youth depending on level of family-risk exposure. Data for these studies were available for 1021 Aboriginal youth, 12‚Äì17 years, drawn from the 2000‚Äì2002 Western Australian Aboriginal Child Health Survey (WAACHS), a population representative survey of 5289 Aboriginal children (0‚Äì17 years) living in 1999 families.

To enhance breastfeeding practices, the World Health Organization discourages pacifiers and bottle-feeding. However, the effect of artificial nipples on breastfeeding duration is poorly defined. The effects of 2 types of artificial nipple exposure on breastfeeding duration were evaluated: 1) cupfeeding versus bottle-feeding for the provision of in-hospital supplements and 2) early (2-5 days) versus late (> weeks) pacifier introduction. Methods. A total of 700 breastfed newborns (36-42 weeks, birth weight ‚â•2200 g) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 intervention groups: bottle/early pacifier (n = 169), bottle/late pacifier (n = 167), cup/early pacifier (n = 185), or cup/late pacifier (n = 179). The cup/bottle intervention was invoked for infants who received supplemental feedings: cup (n = 251), bottle (n = 230). Data were collected at delivery and at 2, 5, 10, 16, 24, 38, and 52 weeks' postpartum. Intervention effects on breastfeeding duration were evaluated with logistic regression and survival analyses. Results. Supplemental feedings, regardless of method (cup or bottle), had a detrimental effect on breastfeeding duration.

However, it is unknown if these children experience psychosocial problems. This study aims to assess their levels of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, behavioural problems and health-related quality of life. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in six hospitals. All consecutive families of which a parent visited the emergency department due to partner violence, substance abuse or suicide attempt between 1 July 2012 and 1 March 2014 with children aged 1.5-17‚Äâyears were approached for participation.

870,Two-month-olds' attention and affective response to maternal still face: A comparison between term and preterm infants in Taiwan,"Maternal still face is a robust experimental procedure designed to examine infants' sensitivity to social contingency and reactivity to its violation. To extend earlier research on the still-face effect on term infants in Western cultures, the present study compared Taiwanese term and preterm infants' attention and affective response to and recovery from a modified maternal still-face procedure that used an additional still-face reengagement sequence at 2 months of age (corrected age for preterm infants). Infants' gaze and facial affect were coded from videos. Results showed that preterm infants were as sensitive as term infants to the interruption to social contingency. Both groups of infants reacted with decreased gaze and positive affect across episodes, together with a decreased latency to gaze aversion and an increased latency to positive affect. Both term and preterm infants also demonstrated a W-shaped pattern of decline-followed-by-recovery in their latency to negative affect. However, compared to term infants, preterm infants became distressed faster and stayed in a negative affective state longer after the first exposure to maternal still face. Effects of prematurity on infant attention and affect regulation were discussed. Implications of preterm infants' heightened affective negativity to mild stress for intervention studies were also addressed. ¬© 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Hsu, H. C. and Jeng, S.

Background: Infant sleep is a frequent concern for parents. However, very little is known about the reasons parents seek, do not seek or delay seeking professional attention about their concerns related to infant sleep. Design and methods: A qualitative study design was used. Twenty audio-taped interviews with parents of healthy 12-month-old infants were conducted at a university-affiliated hospital or parents‚Äô homes depending on where parents felt more comfortable discussing their personal views and medical help-seeking experiences. Thematic content analysis was performed to determine specific patterns and similarities within and between interview data.

OBJECTIVE To examine the effects of CDAs, an innovative social policy to encourage lifelong saving and asset building for long-term development, on parent-reported social-emotional development in early childhood. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A statewide randomized experiment of CDAswas conducted in 2008, drawing a probability sample of 7328 children from all infants born in two 3-month periods in Oklahoma (April 1 through June 30 and August 1 through October 31, 2007). After agreeing to participate in the experiment, caregivers of 2704 infants completed a baseline survey and were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 1358) and control groups (n = 1346). Approximately 84%of participants completed a follow-up survey in the spring of 2011. INTERVENTIONS The intervention offered CDAs, built on the existing Oklahoma 529 college-savings plan, to treatment participants. It also provided additional financial incentives and information. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome-child social-emotional development-is measured by scores from a 17-item version of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional. Caregivers completed it in the 3-year follow-up survey. Lower scores indicate better functioning. RESULTS The CDAs have positive effects on social-emotional development for children at approximately age 4 years.

873,Effects of Paternal Skin-to-Skin Contact in Newborns and Fathers After Cesarean Delivery,"The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of paternal skin-to-skin contact (SSC) on newborns and fathers after cesarean delivery. In total, 108 neonates born via elective cesarean delivery and their fathers were recruited into this study. The neonates were randomly divided into 2 groups (n = 54 each). Newborns in the treatment group received SSC from their fathers shortly after cesarean delivery, whereas those from the control group received only routine care. The neonates' physical condition, breastfeeding rate, and the paternal psychological outcomes were compared between the 2 groups. The newborns in the treatment group had a more stable heart rate and forehead temperature, less duration of crying, and started feeding behavior earlier. The duration of breastfeeding after SSC in the treatment group was longer as well, with statistical significance, than the control group (P < .05). In addition, fathers in the treatment group had lower scores of anxiety and depression and better role attainment than those in the control group, with statistical significance (P < .05). The paternal SSC after cesarean delivery was beneficial for newborns by stabilizing newborns' physical conditions and increasing the breastfeeding rate. Meanwhile, it could significantly reduce anxiety and depression of fathers and facilitate their role attainment.","Huang, X. and Chen, L. and Zhang, L.",0,696
874,"Feeding methods, sleep arrangement, and infant sleep patterns: a Chinese population-based study","Background: Findings from prior research into the effect of feeding methods on infant sleep are inconsistent. The objectives of this study were to examine infants‚Äô sleep patterns by feeding methods and sleep arrangement from birth to eight months old. Methods: This longitudinal cohort study enrolled 524 pregnant women at 34-41 weeks of gestation and their infants after delivery in 2006 and followed up until eight months postpartum. The study subjects were recruited from nine women and children hospitals in nine cities in China (Beijing, Chongqing, Wuhan, Changsha, Nanning, Xiamen, Xi‚Äôan, Jinan, and Hailin). Participating infants were followed up weekly during the first month and monthly from the second to the eighth month after birth. Twenty-four hour sleep diaries recording infants‚Äô sleeping and feeding methods were administered based on caregiver‚Äôs self-report. Multivariable mixed growth curve models were fitted to estimate the effects of feeding methods and sleep arrangement on infants‚Äô sleep patterns over time, controlling for maternal and paternal age, maternal and paternal education level, household income, supplementation of complementary food, and infant birth weight and length. Results: Exclusively formula fed infants had the greatest sleep percentage/24 h, followed by exclusively breast milk fed infants and partially breast milk fed infants (P<0.01). Night waking followed a similar pattern. However, the differences in sleep percentage and night waking frequency between exclusively formula and exclusively breast milk fed infants weakened over time as infants developed. In addition, compared to infants with bed-sharing sleep arrangement, those with room sharing sleep arrangement had greater daytime and 24-hour infant sleep percentage, whereas those with sleeping alone sleep arrangement had greater nighttime sleep percentage. Conclusions: Our data based on caregiver‚Äôs selfreport suggested that partial breastfeeding and bedsharing may be associated with less sleep in infants. Health care professionals need to work with parents of newborns to develop coping strategies that will help prevent early weaning of breastfeeding. ¬© 2015, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Huang, X.

875,Sleep and breathing in premature infants at 6¬†months post-natal age,"BACKGROUND: Poor sleep contributes to the developmental problems seen in preterm infants. We evaluated sleep problems in preterm infants 6¬†months of post-gestational age using the subjective Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ) and objective sleep tests. We also compared the sleep of premature infants with that of full-term infants. METHODS: The study included 68 6-month-old full-term healthy infants and 191 premature infants born at <37¬†weeks gestation. All parents completed the BISQ-Chinese version and sleep diaries. At the same time, all premature infants were submitted to one night of polysomnography (PSG) in the sleep laboratory and also were set up with an actigraph kept for 7¬†days. Statistical analyses were performed using correlation coefficients and the t-test with SPSS version 18 to compare questionnaire responses with other subjective and objective measures of sleep. RESULTS: The sleep problems indicated in the subjective questionnaire for the premature infants, particularly: ""the nocturnal sleep duration, number of night awakenings, daytime sleep duration, duration of time with mouth breathing, and loud-noisy breathing"" had significant correlations with sleep diaries, actigraphy and PSG results. The BISQ showed that duration of infant's sleeping on one side, nocturnal sleep duration, being held to fall asleep, number of nighttime awakenings, daytime sleep duration, subjective consideration of sleep problems, loud-noisy breathing, and duration spent crying during the night were significantly different between the premature infants and the term infants. PSG confirmed the presence of a very high percentage (80.6%) of premature infants with AHI‚Äâ>‚Äâ1 event/hour as indicated by the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: Premature infants have more sleep problems than full-term infants, including the known risk of abnormal breathing during sleep, which has been well demonstrated already with the BISQ-Chinese (CBISQ).","Huang, Y.

876,Factors related to maternal perception of milk supply while in the hospital,"BACKGROUND: Perceived insufficient milk supply is a frequent concern and reason for early weaning in Taiwanese mothers. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to explore the factors related to maternal milk supply. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out at a medical center in northern Taiwan. A total of 205 healthy mother-infant pairs were recruited. A tool to assess insufficient milk supply developed by P.D. Hill and S.S. Humenick (1996) was used to gather breastfeeding information during each participant's hospital stay. RESULTS: Infant-feeding methods, planned breastfeeding duration, infant sucking behaviors, family support, and infant sucking patterns were found to explain 35.3% of variance in maternal perception of milk supply. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Mothers in Taiwan are particularly sensitive to infant crying. To prevent mothers from perceiving inadequate milk supply, nurses should encourage postpartum mothers to suckle their infant on the breast and teach mothers breastfeeding skills and how to pacify crying babies. In addition, hospital managers should make policies to minimize bottle and supplementary formula feeding.","Huang, Y. Y. and Lee, J. T. and Huang, C. M. and Gau, M. L.",0,699
877,Maternal unresponsiveness and infant crying across the first 9 months: A naturalistic longitudinal study,"Tested the hypothesis among 50 mother‚Äìinfant dyads that maternal responsiveness (MRE), defined as promptness of maternal interventions to infant crying (IC), decreases the number and duration of infant crying bouts (CBs). Ss were visited 12 times at home at 3-wk intervals during the 1st 9 mo after the birth of the infant. The mean total observation period for every dyad was 21.7 hrs, and data on frequency and duration of IC and MRE were collected through event- and audiorecording equipment. Results show that average duration of IC was reduced by half from the 1st‚Äì3rd quarter, but average frequency of CBs remained the same. Individual differences in number of CBs at the end of the 1st 6 mo could be partly attributed to differences in MRE: More frequent delay of maternal responses reduced the number of CBs during the 1st 6 mo of life. The hypothesis was not supported. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Hubbard, Frans O. and Van Ijzendoorn, Marinus H.",0,700

Eight infants were videotaped after surgery and segments of the videotapes were categorized as medication inactive or medication active (assumed to relieve pain) based on the usual duration of infants' analgesics. Nurses (N=50) viewed these segments and mean percent agreement with the pharmacologic categorization was 54%. Agreement was high for medication active segments and low for medication inactive ones. Nurses reported using the pain behaviors described in the literature as well as other infant characteristics in their decision making. Infant behaviors observed in the medication inactive snippets were not suggestive enough of the presence of pain to result in the nurses choosing to medicate.","Hudson-Barr, D. C. and Duffey, M.

880,Identification and treatment of adolescents with perinatal anxiety and depression,"Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD) are the most common, yet underdiagnosed and undertreated complication of pregnancy, affecting up to 50% of pregnant and parenting teens. PMAD are a global health issue that can have devastating effects on the mental, physical, emotional, developmental health, and social life of the mother, infant, and family. Adolescents present with similar symptoms of PMAD as their adult counterparts, but also experience isolation from their peer group and lack of resources and coping strategies, as well as difficulty sleeping and lack of concentration and ability to focus. Nurses and nurse practitioners are in an ideal position to assess preexisting risk factors for PMAD. The current applied evidence-based article addresses the diagnosis of PMAD, provides a conceptual framework for understanding the intra-and interpersonal dynamics affecting teens with PMAD, and suggests a new screening tool to guide diagnosis. An easy to recall mnemonic for diagnosis and referral (SAIL AHEAD) is proposed. By using the SAIL AHEAD mnemonic, providers will impact adolescents‚Äô parenting success and resiliency, thereby enhancing their future success in life. ¬© SLACK Incorporated.","Hughes, L.

881,Infant massage compared with crib vibrator in the treatment of colicky infants,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of infant massage compared with that of a crib vibrator in the treatment of infantile colic. METHODS: Infants <7 weeks of age and perceived as colicky by their parents were randomly assigned to an infant massage group (n = 28) or a crib vibrator group (n = 30). Three daily intervention periods were recommended in both groups. Parents recorded infant crying and given interventions in a structured cry diary that was kept for 1 week before (baseline) and for 3 weeks during the intervention. Parents were interviewed after the first and third weeks of intervention to obtain their evaluation of the effectiveness of the given massage or crib vibration. RESULTS: At baseline, the mean amount of total crying was 3.6 (standard deviation: 1.4) hours/day in the massage group infants and 4.2 (2.0) hours/day in the vibrator group infants. The mean amount of colicky crying was 2.1 (standard deviation: 1.1) hours/day and 2.9 (1.5) hours/day, respectively. The mean number of daily intervention periods was 2.2 in both groups. Over the 4-week study, the amount of total and colicky crying decreased significantly in both intervention groups. The reduction in crying was similar in the study groups: total crying decreased by a mean 48% in the massage group and by 47% in the vibrator group, and colicky crying decreased by 64% and 52%, respectively. The amount of other crying (total crying minus colicky crying) remained stable in both groups over the intervention. Ninety-three percent of the parents in both groups reported that colic symptoms decreased over the 3-week intervention, and 61% of the parents in the massage group and 63% of the parents in the crib vibrator group perceived the 3-week intervention as colic reducing. CONCLUSIONS: Infant massage was comparable to the use of a crib vibrator in reducing crying in colicky infants. We suggest that the decrease of total and colicky crying in the present study reflects more the natural course of early infant crying and colic than a specific effect of the interventions.","Huhtala, V. and Lehtonen, L. and Heinonen, R. and Korvenranta, H.",0,704

885,Increased carrying reduces infant crying: A randomized controlled trial,"The crying pattern of normal infants in industrialized societies is characterized by an overall increase until 6 weeks of age followed by a decline until 4 months of age with a preponderance of evening crying. We hypothesized that this 'normal' crying could be reduced by supplemental carrying, that is, increased carrying throughout the day in addition to that which occurs during feeding and in response to crying. In a randomized controlled trial, 99 monther-infant pairs were assigned to an increased carrying or control group. At the time of peak crying (6 weeks of age), infants who received supplemental carrying cried and fussed 43% (1.23 v 2.16 h/d) overall, and 51% less (0.63 v 1.28 hours) during the evening hours (4 PM to midnight). Similar but smaller decreases occurred at 4, 8, and 12 weeks of age. Decreased crying and fussing were associated with increased contentment and feeding frequency but no change in feeding duration or sleep. We conclude that supplemental carrying modifies 'normal' crying by reducing the duration and altering the typical pattern of crying and fussing in the first 3 months of life. The relative lack of carrying in our society may predispose to crying and colic in normal infants.","Hunziker, U. A. and Barr, R. G.",1,707

887,Systematic development and validation of a theory-based questionnaire to assess toddler feeding,"This paper describes the development and validation of a 27-item caregiver-reported questionnaire on toddler feeding. The development of the Toddler Feeding Behavior Questionnaire was based on a theory of interactive feeding thatincorporates caregivers' responses to concerns about their children's dietary intake, appetite, size, and behaviors ratherthan relying exclusively on caregiver actions. Content validity included review by an expert panel (n = 7) and testing in apilot sample (n = 105) of low-income mothers of toddlers. Construct validity and reliability were assessed among a secondsample of low-income mothers of predominately African-American (70%) toddlers aged 12-32 mo (n = 297) participatingin the baseline evaluation of a toddler overweight prevention study. Internal consistency (Cronbach's a: 0.64-0.87) andtest-retest (0.57-0.88) reliability were acceptable for most constructs. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysesrevealed 5 theoretically derived constructs of feeding: responsive, forceful/pressuring, restrictive, indulgent, anduninvolved (root mean square error of approximation = 0.047, comparative fit index = 0.90, standardized root mean squareresidual = 0.06). Statistically significant (P < 0.05) convergent validity results further validated the scale, confirmingestablished relations between feeding behaviors, toddler overweight status, perceived toddler fussiness, and maternalmental health. The Toddler Feeding Behavior Questionnaire adds to the field by providing a brief instrument thatcan be administered in 5 min to examine how caregiver-reported feeding behaviors relate to toddler health and behavior.","Hurley, K.

888,Breastfeeding and dietary variety among preterm children aged 1-3 years,"Among infants born at term, breastfeeding is associated with increased dietary variety in childhood. Preterm birth can limit early feeding options while simultaneously increasing risk for negative health outcomes that could benefit from dietary-based preventative measures. We assessed whether breastfeeding is associated with increased dietary variety at 1-3 years amongst children born preterm. We analyzed baseline data from two clinical trials investigating cognitive development after fatty-acid supplementation for 10-39 month-old children born before 35 weeks gestation (n = 189). At baseline, mothers reported breastfeeding history and completed a 161-item food-frequency questionnaire for their child. Dietary variety was assessed via 3 measures: (1) proportion items consumed at least once per month, (2) servings of a given item consumed relative to total monthly food servings, (3) daily probability of consuming a given item. Overall, 88% of children were ever breastfed (median duration = 89 days, range = 0-539), and 48% of children were ever exclusively breastfed (median duration = 59 days, range = 3-240). Exclusive breastfeeding duration was associated with dietary variety increases of 0.9% (95% CI = 0.1-1.7) for vegetables, 1.6% (95% CI = 0.2-3.0) for meat/fish, and 1.3% (95% CI = 0.2-2.4) for grain/starch, for each additional month of exclusive breastfeeding after adjustment for key confounders. Correspondingly, the variety of sweets consumed decreased by 1.2% (CI: -2.1, -0.3) per month of any breastfeeding after adjustment. These results are consistent with those in children born at term, and if causal, could provide additional support for exclusive breastfeeding to improve diet and health in children born preterm. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Husk, J.

A questionnaire was mailed to 521 licensed GDPs. Descriptive statistics were used, and bivariate and logistic regression analyses were performed. The response rate was 52.6%. Although 89.8% mentioned counseling parents and caregivers, only 44.2% were familiar with anticipatory guidance. Whereas 98.2% agreed that early examinations are important to prevent ECC, only 51.8% were aware of the recommendation for a first visit by 12 months of age. GDPs who recommended early dental visits were significantly more likely to be recent graduates, more familiar with professional guidelines, and less likely to be deterred by a child's crying or behavior. In conclusion, GDPs in Selangor are aware about the importance of early dental visits in ECC prevention. However, a considerable number of them are still not aware of the recommendation that children must first visit the dentist by 12 months of age. Furthermore, some of their current practices in ECC management and prevention do not match professional recommendations.","Hussein, A. S. and Schroth, R. J. and Abu-Hassan, M. I.",0,711

Methods: A postal survey was carried out of knowledge of SIDS risk factors and infant care practices of 200 mothers with infants aged 6-8 weeks and 3-4 months. Results: Mothers who could cite supine sleeping as protective comprised 84%, while 73% knew that smoking was a risk factor. Fewer knew that room sharing, keeping the face clear of bedding, and avoiding bed sharing and overheating are also protective. Fifty-four percent of the infants usually room-share with a parent, while 39% both room-share and sleep in their own bed. Sixteen percent usually co-slept for part or all of the night. Nearly one-third used pacifiers. Mothers who smoked during pregnancy comprised 8%, while 7% had smoked in the last 24 hours. Most infants (97%) had been breastfed at some time. Conclusions: Maternal education of the benefits of supine sleeping, not smoking, and breastfeeding appear well understood by these mothers.

893,Effect of infant formula on stool characteristics of young infants,"BACKGROUND: Many infants are switched between multiple formula preparations early in life because of perceived abnormalities in stooling pattern as well as gastrointestinal symptoms. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the type of formula consumed and the stooling characteristics and gastrointestinal symptoms of young infants. METHODS: Healthy 1-month-old infants were fed one of four commercial formula preparations (Enfamil, Enfamil with Iron, ProSobee, and Nutramigen) for 12 to 14 days in a prospective double-blinded (parent/physician) fashion. Parents completed a daily diary of stool characteristics as well as severity of spitting, gas, and crying for the last 7 days of the study period. A breast-fed infant group was studied as well. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty five infants were enrolled and 238 completed the study. Infants receiving breast milk or Nutramigen had twice as many stools as other formula groups (P < .001). Infants receiving ProSobee had hard/firm stools more often than breast-fed or other formula-fed groups (P < .00001). Watery stools were more common in infants fed Nutramigen than other formula groups (P < .04). Green stools were more common in 12 mg/L iron preparations (Enfamil with iron, ProSobee, Nutramigen) than in those with 1 mg/L (Enfamil, breast milk) (P < .00001). Spitting, gassiness, and crying were of equal severity in all formula groups. CONCLUSIONS: The interpretation of stool frequency, color, and consistency must take into account the infant's formula type as significant variations in normal infants occur. Parental education on the range of infant stooling characteristics as well as the common occurrence of spitting, gas, and crying may alleviate concern for formula intolerance and underlying gastrointestinal disease.","Hyams, J.

895,Gastroesophageal reflux: one reason why baby won't eat,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is the movement of gastric contents retrograde into the esophagus. Sometimes the refluxate is seen as emesis, but often reflux is ""silent,"" meaning that there are no discrete symptoms during an episode. In adults, the most common symptom of GER is heartburn, whereas in infancy excessive crying and malaise are symptoms that prompt investigation for GER, with or without esophagitis. Symptoms of esophagitis in infancy may include arching (hyperextension) of the torso and refusal of feedings. Tube feedings may be required to treat infants with failure to thrive who refuse oral feedings. Paradoxically, tube feedings increase the number of GER episodes. A hypothetical explanation for refusal of food in infancy is that pain with swallowing (odynophagia) or heartburn are consequences of peptic esophagitis. As a result, infants will learn to refuse food if it hurts or if they fear that it will hurt to eat. Another possible mechanism is visceral hyperalgesia, a neuropathic condition in which prior experience changes sensory nerves so that previously innocuous stimuli are perceived as painful. Some infants may have especially sensitive sensory nerves in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which predisposes visceral hyperalgesia to develop. Thus pain occurs from luminal distension or acid reflux in the absence of tissue damage. The evaluation of babies who won't eat includes a careful history and physical examination to exclude the possibility of chronic systemic illness. Refusal to feed is an unusual manifestation of a common condition: GER disease. The initial tests for GER usually include a barium swallow study to assess the upper gastrointestinal anatomy, endoscopy and esophageal biopsy to assess esophagitis, and an intraesophageal pH study, which is useful in ""silent"" reflux to quantitate the duration of esophageal acid exposure and to correlate discrete symptom episodes with periods of reflux. The treatment of infants and toddlers who refuse to eat because of pain resulting from visceral hyperalgesia or reflux esophagitis involves removing the pain associated with eating and making eating a pleasurable experience. Treatment for esophagitis may include maintaining an upright posture after meals and thickened feeds, medication to improve gastrointestinal motility or to decrease acid secretion, or fundoplication.","Hyman, P.

896,Childhood Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders: Neonate/Toddler,"Recognizing the importance of childhood functional gastrointestinal disorders in understanding adult functional gastrointestinal disorders, and encouraging clinical and research interest, the Rome Coordinating Committee added a pediatric working team to Rome II in 1999. For Rome III, there was an increase from 1 to 2 pediatric working teams. This report summarizes the current consensus concerning functional disorders in infants and toddlers. Another report covers disorders diagnosed more often in school-aged children and adolescents. The symptoms from functional gastrointestinal disorders in children younger than 5 years depend on maturational factors in anatomy, gastrointestinal physiology, and intellectual and affective functioning. There has been little or no change for infant regurgitation, infant rumination syndrome, or infant dyschezia. Cyclic vomiting syndrome may be diagnosed after 2 rather than 3 episodes. The description of infant colic has been expanded, although there was consensus that infant colic does not reflect gastrointestinal malfunction. The greatest change was in functional constipation. Functional constipation and functional fecal retention in the 1999 report were merged into a single entity: functional constipation. Data-driven changes in diagnostic criteria for functional constipation appear to be less rigid and more inclusive than previous criteria. ¬© 2006 American Gastroenterological Association Institute.","Hyman, P.

898,Severe infantile colic and food intolerance: A long-term prospective study,"To determine the relationship between infantile colic and cow‚Äôs milk protein intolerance (CMPI) in formula-fed infants, 70 infants (38 male, 32 female) were selected, with mean age 30.2 ¬± 21.4 days, with severe colic (duration of crying >4 h per day for 5 days per week). In 50 of the infants in the study group (71.4%) there was a remission of symptoms when cow‚Äôs milk protein (CMP) was eliminated from the diet. Two successive challenges caused the return of symptoms in all these 50 infants. There was a positive anamnesis for atopy in 9 of 50 of the patients with CMP-related colic and in 1 of 20 of those with non-CMP-related colic (p > 0.05). A follow-up period of 18 months‚Äô mean duration showed that 22 of 50 (44%) of the infants with CMP-related colic and 1 of 20 (5%) of those with non-CMP-related colic developed an overt alimentary intolerance (p < 0.02). We conclude that a considerable percentage of the infants with severe colic also have CMPI and that in these cases, dietetic treatment should be the first therapeutic approach. ¬© 1991 Raven Press, Ltd., New York.","Iacono, G. and Carroccio, A. and Montalto, G. and Cavataio, F. and Bragion, E. and Lorello, D. and Balsamo, V. and Notarbartolo, A.",0,719

901,Mothers' perception of excessive crying in infancy in South Eastern Nigeria,"Background: Excessive infant crying, though usually benign, can be very troublesome to parents with unwanted consequences on the child. Previous reports had shown cultural and racial differences in it's perception by mothers. We undertook this study to determine the prevalence of excessive crying in our area of practice and also determine associated factors. Method: This was a cross sectional, questionnaire based descriptive study on mothers' perception of their infants' crying. Subjects were mother/infant pairs attending the well baby clinics at the Institute of Child Health, University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, Mother of Christ Specialist Hospital, Enugu and the Ebonyi State University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki. Result: Four hundred and eighty mother/infant pairs participated in the study. Seven point nine percent of the mothers reported excessive crying in their infants. There was no significant diurnal variation in the rate of excessive crying among these infants.Educated mothers (P = 0.008) reported excessive crying less frequently than the uneducated ones. Other maternal and infants demographic factors did not have any influence on mothers' perception of excessive crying in their infants. Conclusion: Excessive crying among infants is more commonly perceived by uneducated mothers.

902,The role of melatonin and cortisol circadian rhythms in the pathogenesis of infantile colic,"Background: Despite the high prevalence of infantile colic, the pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Cortisol and melatonin hormones affect gastrointestinal system development in several ways, and interestingly, both cortisol and melatonin‚Äôs circadian rhythms begin around the 3rd month in which infantile colic symptoms start to decrease. We hypothesized that infantile colic might associate with desynchronization of normal circadian rhythms of these hormones. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of melatonin and cortisol in the pathogenesis of infantile colic. Methods: Patients who were diagnosed as infantile colic according to Wessel‚Äôs ‚Äúrule of three‚Äù were enrolled in the colic group. We measured the saliva melatonin and cortisol levels of colic group and control group infants. In both groups, the saliva samples were taken in mornings and at evenings, at the time of diagnosis and 6th month. Results: Fifty-five infants finished the study. Melatonin circadian rhythm developed earlier in the control group than the infantile colic group in our study. We found no significant difference between the daily mean cortisol levels. However, infants with colic had flatter daily cortisol slope than controls which pointed out the probability that they had a less clearly defined cortisol rhythm than infants without colic. Conclusions: We found an association between melatonin levels and infantile colic. However, more research is needed to fully understand the role of hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal¬†axis and hormone‚Äôs role on infantile colic physiopathology. ¬© 2018, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine.","ƒ∞nce, T. and Akman, H. and √áimrin, D. and Aydƒ±n, A.",0,723
903,"Prophylactic use of a probiotic in the prevention of colic, regurgitation, and functional constipation: a randomized clinical trial","IMPORTANCE: Infantile colic, gastroesophageal reflux, and constipation are the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders that lead to referral to a pediatrician during the first 6 months of life and are often responsible for hospitalization, feeding changes, use of drugs, parental anxiety, and loss of parental working days with relevant social consequences. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether oral supplementation with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 during the first 3 months of life can reduce the onset of colic, gastroesophageal reflux, and constipation in term newborns and thereby reduce the socioeconomic impact of these conditions. DESIGN: A prospective, multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was performed on term newborns (age <1 week) born at 9 different neonatal units in Italy between September 1, 2010, and October 30, 2012. SETTING: Parents were asked to record in a structured diary the number of episodes of regurgitation, duration of inconsolable crying (minutes per day), number of evacuations per day, number of visits to pediatricians, feeding changes, hospitalizations, visits to a pediatric emergency department for a perceived health emergency, pharmacologic interventions, and loss of parental working days.

904,"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pediatricians on infantile colic in the Middle East and North Africa region","BACKGROUND: Regional evidence-based guidelines for the prophylaxis and management of infantile colic are not available for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The Allied Against Infantile Functional GI Disorders (ACT) Working Group was created in January, 2015 to determine the knowledge gaps and the current management practices of infantile colic by physicians in the MENA region. The ACT group determined the need for a survey to address these questions. The objectives of the survey were to highlight current clinical practices on the management of infantile colic and to raise awareness on colic severity in the MENA region. METHODS: The ACT working group developed the survey which included respondent characteristics and closed questions on practice in colic prevention. The survey was subject to validation and ethics committee approval in all countries. RESULTS: A total of 1628 physicians (mostly pediatricians (75.4%), neonatologists (2.4%) and general practitioners (19.8%)) responded to the survey. The 5 most represented countries were KSA (27.9%), Kuwait (22.1%), Morocco (13.8%), Lebanon (10.6%), and Iraq (7.4%). Most of the respondents (77.8%) practiced in governmental settings. A majority of respondents (91.7%) reported that colic is diagnosed predominantly by clinical examination. Above 63%, of pediatricians surveyed, believed that the colic prevalence rate was >40%, which is greater than the 20% rate reported in worldwide surveys. Yet, most of the responding physicians (73%) prefer to simply reassure parents rather than prescribe a therapeutic agent. Most physicians were either neutral (58%) or did not endorse (18.4%) colic prophylaxis. Of those who prescribed formulae for non-breastfed children, a majority (64.3%) chose ""Comfort"" formulae over hydrolyzed or lactose-free formulae or formulae with probiotics. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey suggest that a substantial proportion of responding physicians from the selected MENA countries do not advocate for prophylaxis of colic. The findings of this survey suggest that more educational efforts are required to increase awareness of the strong body of evidence supporting the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention and management of infantile colic.","Indrio, F. and Miqdady, M. and Al Aql, F. and Haddad, J. and Karima, B. and Khatami, K. and Mouane, N. and Rahmani, A. and Alsaad, S. and Salah, M. and Samy, G. and Tafuri, S.",0,725
905,Modification of stool's water content in constipated infants: management with an adapted infant formula,"BACKGROUND: Constipation is a common occurrence in formula-fed infants. The aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate the impact of a formula with high levels of lactose and magnesium, in compliance with the official regulations, on stool water content, as well as a parental assessment of constipation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty healthy term-born, formula-fed infants, aged 4-10 weeks, with functional constipation were included. All infants were full-term and fed standard formula. Exclusion criteria were preterm and/or low birth weight, organic constipation, being breast fed or fed a formula specially designed to treat constipation. Stool composition was measured by near-infrared reflectance analysis (NIRA) and parents answered questions about crying associated with defecation and stool consistency at baseline and after two weeks of the adapted formula. RESULTS: After 2 weeks of the adapted formula, stool water content increased from 71 +/- 8.1% to 84 +/- 5.9%, (p < 0.02). There was no significant change in the stool's fat, protein or carbohydrate content. Parental impressions of constipation were improved with the decrease in stool hardness (100% with hard stools at baseline, 10% after 2 weeks), pain with defecation (90% at baseline, 10% after 2 weeks), and the requirement for rectal stimulation to achieve defecation (70% at baseline, 30% after 2 weeks, p < 0.001 for all three indicators). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that an adapted formula with high levels of lactose and magnesium increases stool water content and improves symptoms of constipation in term-born, formula-fed infants.

The importance of fathers and grandmothers in providing emotional and practical support for breast-feeding mothers is highlighted, since those who were still breast feeding at eight weeks all felt that they were receiving similar or better support postnatally than they were antenatally. Significantly more intervention mothers were breast feeding their babies at eight weeks than in the wider practice population of mothers outside the study who intended to breast feed. Fathers' attitudes to breast feeding postnatally were fairly similar to those before the baby was born with breast feeding in public and knowing how much milk the baby was getting having the most influence on whether they felt that their partner should continue to breast feed. this type of intervention could be part of a multi-faceted approach towards improving breast-feeding initiation and continuation, particularly in areas of low prevalence. Health professionals should be opportunistic about involving other family members in discussions about breast feeding whenever possible, both antenatally and postnatally. ¬© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

908,Concurrent search for unrelated cord and volunteer donor in high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"To assess the effectiveness of the search for an unrelated donor on the outcome of patients with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we analyzed prospectively 136 patients who underwent a search for cord blood (CB) and an unrelated volunteer donor (UD) at the same time. The probability of finding a donor was 58.2%, 70.3%, and 75.7% at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. The median time to find a donor was 1.8 months for CB and 3.5 months for UD. Of the 99 patients with a donor, 38.4% failed to undergo the transplant because of a relapse observed at a median of 4 months from the start of the search. In univariate analysis, absence of relapse during the search (p< 0.0001) and transplant (p=0.004) showed a positive impact on long-term survival. In multivariate analysis, relapse during the search remained the key factor affecting survival (p<0.0001). Since an extension of the search beyond 3 months enables only a slight increase in the probability of finding a donor compared to the increased risk of relapse, the time of the search should not exceed the 3-month time point. The simultaneous search for CB and UD increases the likelihood of performing a timely transplant. ¬© Springer-Verlag 2012.","Iori, A. P. and Valle, V. and Piciocchi, A. and Meloni, G. and Torelli, G.

Although previous studies have reported that USVs are related to anxiety, others have reported that they are related to simple, nonemotional factors, such as physiological reactions to coldness. In this study, we examined the influence of three maternal separations on rat pups. The number of USVs during 5 min of USV test under maternal separation, latency in the righting reflex as motor function, and body temperature were recorded twice (the first and second tests) before and after the pups were put in various environments for 10 min. The environments were no maternal separation (Control: CON), maternal separation with littermates (LMS), and single maternal separation with a heater (SMS). In the second test, the SMS pups had fewer USVs, a lower body temperature, and a more rapid righting reflex than the CON and LMS pups. In addition, there was no strong correlation between USVs and righting reflex. As a result, pups undergoing 10 min of SMS while being kept warm by the heater showed rapid righting reflex. Thus, by a single maternal separation, the number of USVs decreased but the decrease was unrelated to decrease in motor function. ¬© 2019 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.","Isobe, A. and Kawaguchi, M.",0,737

Method: A prospective study of 317 newborns and their mothers was performed. Infant temperament and the mother's anxiety and confidence in caregiving were evaluated at 8 and 32 weeks after childbirth using the Mother and Baby Scale. The mother's emotional state was evaluated using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. These variables were correlated with 5-HTTLPR and Stin2 variants in the 5-HTT gene and the DRD4 variable number tandem repeats Exon 3 and MAO-A variable number tandem repeats genotypes of both the infants and their mothers. Results: The irritability scores of infants with the 5-HTTLPR s allele showed a linear relationship with their mothers' anxiety of caregiving at 8 (p = .011) and 32 weeks (p = .001), whereas the irritability of infants carrying the HTTLPR ll genotype was independent of their mothers' anxiety. Conclusions: The review of the literature in this field and the results of this study support that the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism moderates the influence of the mother's anxiety on infant irritability.

We aimed to identify associations between demographic and psychosocial variables at early stages of a child‚Äôs admission to the ICU and depression and anxiety in family members at approximately 3 months after admission. We also explored predictive models for depression and anxiety at 3 months after admission. Methods: This study is a secondary analysis of data from a previous clinical trial of palliative care for family members in ICUs, in which 380 family members of 220 children reported demographic and psychosocial status at approximately 1 week after ICU admission (baseline), at discharge from the ICUs, and at 3 months after the child‚Äôs admission to the ICU. Clinical data were extracted from the children‚Äôs medical records. We used linear regression models and stepwise linear regression for the analyses. Results: After controlling for significant confounders of gender (female) and child mortality, worse psychological status at baseline, represented by reported depression, anxiety, and acute stress symptoms, was associated with more severe depression and anxiety at 3 months. Also, a better family relationship at baseline was associated with lower depression and anxiety at 3 months. Conclusion: We suggest a need to screen family members of children admitted to the ICU with validated scales and intervening with those at high risk of depression and anxiety.

High depression scores were found in 233 mothers, which were associated with variables related to infants‚Äô care (poor satisfaction with infant care support, p < 0.001","Iwata, S. and Kinoshita, M. and Fujita, F. and Tsuda, K. and Unno, M. and Horinouchi, T. and Morokuma, S. and Saitoh, S. and Iwata, O.",0,740
921,Pacifier use versus no pacifier use in breastfeeding term infants for increasing duration of breastfeeding,"Background: To successfully initiate and maintain breastfeeding for a longer duration, the World Health Organization's Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding recommends total avoidance of artificial teats or pacifiers for breastfeeding infants. Offering the pacifier instead of the breast to calm the infant may lead to less frequent episodes of breastfeeding and as a consequence may reduce breast milk production and shorten duration of breastfeeding","Jaafar, S.

922,"Complementary feeding practices and nutrient intakes of children aged 6-24 months from Bangladeshi background living in Tower Hamlets, East London: A feasibility study","Background: The aim of this study was to assess dietary intakes and complementary feeding practices of children aged 6-24 months who are from Bangladeshi ancestry and living in Tower Hamlets, London, and determine the feasibility of a larger, population-representative study. Methods: Questionnaires for demographic variables and feeding practices, and 24-h dietary recalls were administered to 25 mothers to determine whether it would be feasible to conduct a similar study on a representative sample size of the same population. Data from both tools were used to determine adequacy of complementary feeding practices through the WHO indicators and an infant and child feeding index score as well as overall macronutrient and micronutrient intake. Results: Four children had varying suboptimal complementary feeding practices: two children failed to achieve the minimum dietary diversity, one child was being fed cow's milk before the age of 1 year, and one scored 'poor' on the infant and child feeding index. Most notably, the mean protein intake (39.7 g/day, SD 18.2) was higher than RNIs for all age groups (P = 0.001). Vitamin D intake was below recommendations (P = 0.006) for the 12-24-month age group. For the 10-12-month age group, zinc intake fell below recommendations (P = 0.028). For the 6-9-month combined age group, iron and zinc intakes were below recommendations (P = 0.021 and P = 0.002, respectively). Conclusions: Given the feasibility of this study, the results obtained require a large-scale study to be conducted to confirm findings.

923,A comparison of temperament and maternal bother in infants with and without colic,"This descriptive, retrospective study compared the temperament styles of 25 4-to 8-month-old infants who had colic with the temperament styles of 30 infants of similar age without colic. Infant temperament style was characterized by the mother's ratings of her infant's behavioral style. The degree of bother that the mother experienced in relationship to her infant's temperament also was examined. Results indicated that mothers of infants with colic rated their infants' temperaments differently than mothers of infants without colic in the temperament dimensions of activity and mood. Mothers of infants with colic were more bothered by the infants' temperament dimension of mood than were mothers of infants without colic. More infants in the colic group were characterized as difficult than were infants in the noncolic group. Individual temperament characteristics should be considered in the differential diagnosis of primary excessive crying (colic) during the newborn and infant periods. ¬© 1995 W.B.

Both hydrolysate formulas were associated with a significant, comparable reduction in crying duration and intensity from baseline in 15 of 22 infants with complete data. Subsequent challenge data suggest that the population studied were infants experiencing colicky symptoms due to protein sensitivity. A greater proportion of infants showed a positive reaction (> or = 1.5 h of crying/d) to the protein challenges than the placebo challenge, and crying was rated as more intense during whey and milk protein challenges.","Jakobsson, I. and Lothe, L. and Ley, D. and Borschel, M.

927,Stability and outcome of persistent infant crying,"Six week old infants who fussed and cried for 3 or more hrs per day (persistent criers), evening criers, and moderate criers were assessed using researcher and maternal measures of infant, maternal and family characteristics at 6 weeks, 5 months and 15 months of infant age. Convergent evidence of stable individual differences in neguuve behavior was found between 6 weeks - 5 months and 5-15 months of age. Objectively hard-to-soothe infants, particularly, were distinguished on a range of researcher and maternal measures. Between 6 weeks and 15 months, infant negative behavior was not a stable characteristic, although mothers continued to rate the same infants as fussy/difficult. In multiple regression analyses, infant negative behavior at 6 weeks did not predict maternal or researcher measures of infant negativity, temperament, behavior problems or cognition at 15 months.

928,The Surviving Crying study: Progress report for the first stage of research,"The term 'infant colic' has been used to refer both to 'prolonged' infant crying (a measure of crying) and to parents' concern that 'excessive' crying is a sign that something is wrong with their baby. There is growing evidence that the terms need to be distinguished, so that the traditional focus on the crying is balanced by an equal focus on the impact of the crying on parents. The Surviving Crying study is a first step towards developing and evaluating routine NHS services to support parents who are worried about their baby's excessive crying. This report summarises the study's overall aims and methods and describes the first stage, designed to develop this parental support package. The package comprises a website, printed materials for parents who do not use the internet and a CBT-based programme manual for delivering direct one-to-one or small-group support sessions to parents. Stage two of the study, designed to provide an initial evaluation of the package and its suitability for use in the NHS, is underway.

932,Parental perspectives on retention and secondary use of neonatal dried bloodspots: A Dutch mixed methods study,"Background: Neonatal bloodspot screening (NBS) identifies conditions to offer early intervention and minimize irreversible damage. NBS policies guide a comprehensive system including processes for storage of neonatal dried blood spots (NDBS). NDBS retention and secondary use policies have been subject of public debates internationally, suggesting that the public's perceptions of NDBS policy are not always on par with existing policies. The current study aims to provide insight in relevant factors for new parents in the Netherlands regarding retention and secondary use of NDBS. These factors can be taken into account when developing or updating NDBS policies. Methods: A mixed methods design was used combining an online survey (n = 753), focus groups (6 groups, 37 participants), and individual in-depth interviews (n = 7). The discussed topics included: parental information, obtaining informed consent, support for retention, and support for secondary use. The study population consisted of Dutch-speaking new parents: pregnant women (‚â•20 weeks) and/or their partner, and parents of at least one child (‚â§5 years). Results: New parents expressed needs for easily accessible information, adequate communication on the retention and (potential) use of NDBS, clearly described safeguards for privacy, a more active consent process, regulation for the actors conducting NDBS research, and parental involvement in decisions on secondary use. Overall, participants were positive about prolonged retention and different types of secondary use if those needs were met. Conclusions: While parental involvement is a challenge, our study is an example of gauging parent's perspectives on NDBS policy and contributes to including these perspectives in the current policy discussion on longer retention. Prolonged retention could be a feasible option in the Netherlands if several prerequisites are met. Therefore, implementation studies involving parents are needed. ¬© 2019 The Author(s).","Jansen, M.

934,The evaluation of nasal mupirocin to prevent Staphylococcus aureus burn wound colonization in routine clinical practice,"Background: Staphylococcus aureus wound colonization frequently occurs in patients with burns and can cause impaired wound healing. Nasal mupirocin application may contribute to the reduction of burn wound colonization of endogenous origin, whereas colonization by the exogenous route can be reduced by blocking cross-infection from other sources. In this study we evaluated whether the implementation of routine treatment of patients and burn center personnel using nasal mupirocin ointment reduces S. aureus burn wound colonization. Methods: We composed three study groups, consisting of a control period (Control), a mupirocin period (MUP), in which patients with burns were all receiving nasal mupirocin at admission, and a mupirocin + personnel period (MUP + P), in which we also screened the burn center personnel and decolonized S. aureus carriers by nasal mupirocin. Results: The patients who carried S. aureus in their nose and did not have S. aureus burn wound colonization at admission were considered as patients susceptible for the use of nasal mupirocin. In these patients, the S. aureus burn wound colonization rate was the same in all study groups. S. aureus nasal carriage was a significant independent risk factor for burn wound colonization (OR: 3.3","Jaspers, M. E. H. and Breederveld, R. S. and Tuinebreijer, W. E. and Diederen, B. M.

936,The pacifier debate,"A variety of studies have indicated that pacifier use lowers the risk of SIDS. Many observational studies have demonstrated a negative association between pacifier use and breastfeeding duration. However, observational studies cannot be used to determine whether the pacifier is the real cause of breastfeeding cessation. Evidence for causation can be better supplied by randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Three RCTs have been conducted on the relationship between pacifiers and breastfeeding, but each study has limitations, implying that the evidence of not causal effect can be questionated. We have recently presented the results of a large RCT which demonstrated that in mothers who are successfully breastfeeding at 2weeks, the recommendation to offer a pacifier does not modify the prevalence of exclusive and any breastfeeding at different ages or the duration of lactation.It is therefore important that lactation consultants and international agencies reexamine their staunch position to discourage the use of pacifiers on the basis of a supposed adverse effect on the success and duration of breastfeeding. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Jenik, A.

939,Prescribing patterns of polypharmacy in Korean pediatric patients,"Background Several studies have examined the risk and health outcomes related to polypharmacy among the elderly. However, information regarding polypharmacy among pediatric patients is lacking. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of polypharmacy and its related factors among the pediatric population of South Korea. Methods We used national claim data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service‚ÄîPediatric Patients Sample (HIRA-PPS) in Korea originating from 2012 through 2016. Polypharmacy was defined as a daily average of two or more drugs used yearly. Complex chronic conditions (CCCs) were examined to evaluate concomitant chronic diseases in pediatric patients. Age-specific contraindications and potential drug-drug interactions were assessed according to criteria established by the Korea Institute of Drug Safety & Risk Management (KIDS). Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were conducted to analyze the status of polypharmacy and its associated risk factors in pediatric patients. Results The 5-year prevalence of pediatric polypharmacy in pediatric patients was 3.7%. The prevalence of polypharmacy was much higher in younger pediatric patients: 9.5% for patients between the ages of 1‚Äì7 years, 0.9% for ages 6‚Äì11 years, and 1.1% for ages 12‚Äì19 years. Pediatric patients with CCCs, Medical Aid benefits, or a hospital admission history had a significantly higher prevalence of polypharmacy when compared to their counterparts without those conditions. The most commonly prescribed drugs were respiratory agents (29%) followed by anti-allergic drugs (18.7%), central nervous system agents (15.9%), antibiotics (10.1%), and gastrointestinal drugs (7.7%). There was a positive correlation between the daily average number of inappropriate prescriptions and the degree of polypharmacy, especially in pediatric patients between the ages of 1‚Äì7 years. Contraindications and potential drug-drug interactions occurred in 11.0% and 10.1% of patients exposed to polypharmacy, respectively. Conclusions One in ten pediatric patients under the age of 7 years was prescribed two or more concurrent drugs on average per day. Furthermore, pediatric patients exposed to polypharmacy showed an increased risk of inappropriate drug use. The implementation of a medication review system that considers pediatric patient polypharmacy exposure would reduce inappropriate drug use and prevent unwanted adverse outcomes. ¬© 2019 Jeon et al.

940,Congenital para esophageal hernia: a 10 year experience from Saudi Arabia,"OBJECTIVE: Para esophageal hiatal hernia is a rare childhood condition and reported series have had scant number of children which makes diagnosis a challenge. The authors sought to study the presentation and the outcome of treatment of congenital para esophageal hernias (CPEH) over a period of 10 years from a single tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The records of 9 patients presenting between 1997 and 2007, were retrospectively analyzed for demographics, presenting features, referral diagnoses, investigations, management including operative procedures, their outcome and follow-up. RESULTS: Nine patients (3 males and 6 females) aged between 8 days to 34 months were seen. Respiratory distress (n=6), vomiting (n=5) and frequent respiratory tract infections (n=3) were the most common presentations. Cyanosis (n=2), cough and excessive crying were the other important symptoms. The referral diagnoses in these patients included congenital Bochdalek's hernias, lung abscess, bronchogenic cyst, pneumatocoele, bronchiolitis, and pneumonias which reflected a misinterpretation of their clinical findings and chest X-rays. Seven of these patients had other associated congenital anomalies. Three had cardiovascular abnormalities and 2 had lesions of the central nervous system. A pair of siblings had Marfan's syndrome. All the patients had abnormal chest C-rays and an UGS (upper GI series) proved to be diagnostic in 8 patients. The CT scans done in 4 patients corroborated the findings of the UGS. A laparotomy was done on most patients (n=8) which comprised of reduction of the stomach, resection of the hernial sac, tightening of the hiatus and a gastropexy or a gastrostomy. One patient, who underwent thoracotomy died of surgical complications. Two others died of causes unrelated to the surgery. The remaining six operated patients have been followed up for a median of 3.5 years and are doing well. CONCLUSION: CPEH is uncommon in children, presented with respiratory tract symptoms and vomiting, and may be associated with Martan's syndrome. It should be considered in the workup of a child with vomiting or frequent chest infections. Abnormal chest X-rays may indicate the diagnosis and a subsequent UGS, is confirmatory. The present study found the aparotomya good approach for repair of the wide hiatus. A gastropexy and a floppy fundoplication were added to prevent reherniation and post operative reflux though given the small numbers it is not possible to determine the place of either of these procedures. CPEH may be frequently associated with other congenital problems which may impact survival.","Jetley, N. K. and Al-Assiri, A. H. and Al Awadi, D.",0,753

We aimed to investigate the association between early-life pain experience and pre-adolescence spinal pain. We conducted a study of 29,861 pre-adolescents (age 11‚Äì14) from the Danish National Birth Cohort. As indicators of early-life pain, we used infantile colic and recurrent otitis media, reported by mothers when their children were 6 and 18 months. Self-reported spinal pain (neck, middle back, and/or low back pain) was obtained in the 11-year follow-up, classified according to severity. Associations between early-life pain and spinal pain in pre-adolescents were estimated using multinomial logistic regression models. To account for sample selection, inverse probability weighting was applied. Children experiencing pain in early life were more likely to report severe spinal pain in pre-adolescence. The association appeared stronger with exposure to two pain exposures (relative risk ratio, 1.31","Joergensen, A. C. and Lucas, R. and Hestbaek, L. and Andersen, P. K. and Nybo Andersen, A. M.",0,754
942,Do cry features reflect pain intensity in preterm neonates? A preliminary study,"The purpose of this study was to investigate if cries from preterm neonates would reflect changes in pain intensity following interventions. The cries from 25 preterm neonates from an original sample of 122 were audiorecorded while the infant was undergoing heelstick during a randomized crossover design testing the efficacy of: pacifier with sucrose or water, or prone position as compared to standard care. Both pacifier conditions reduced procedural pain according to a validated composite pain measure (the Premature Infant Pain Profile). There were proportionately fewer cries in the two pacifier groups compared to the prone positioning and standard care groups, and cry duration was positively correlated with PIPP scores. However, neither cry duration nor fundamental frequency reflected group differences. Further research is needed to determine if cry is a sensitive and valid indicator of pain in preterm infants.","Johnston, C.

Methods This is a prospective cohort study comprising 8,761 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Stressful events were measured using a maternal questionnaire completed at 3 time points before their child was 4 years old. The association between stressful events and trajectories of bedwetting from 4 to 9 years was examined using multinomial regression. Results The association with stressful events was strongest for the frequent persistent bedwetting trajectory (wetting at least twice a week up to age 9). A 1 standard deviation increase in the stressful events score was associated with a 29% (13-47%) increase in the odds of experiencing frequent persistent bedwetting compared with normal attainment of nighttime bladder control.

Although areal context is not often considered in morbidity studies, this study evaluates the importance of place of residence given that areas offer differential access to health infrastructures and different contextual factors that could affect health. Also examined is the role of geographic heterogeneity on the recent racial divergence in CHD in the United States. Results indicate that area of residence is associated with CHD diagnosis, net of health and demographic variables. The area-stratified analysis documents that rural residents are most impacted by exercise and smoking, while being male or above age 50 are most detrimental for suburban residents. In addition, the racial divergence in CHD is driven by differences in rural locales. These findings indicate a disparate impact of geography on CHD and highlight the need for health research to take into account areal context.

947,Comprehensive health evaluation of the newly adopted child,"Children who join families through the process of adoption, whether through a domestic or international route, often have multiple health care needs. Pediatricians and other health care personnel are in a unique position to guide families in achieving optimal health for the adopted children as families establish a medical home. Shortly after placement in an adoptive home, it is recommended that children have a timely comprehensive health evaluation to provide care for known medical needs and identify health issues that are unknown. It is important to begin this evaluation with a review of all available medical records and pertinent verbal history. A complete physical examination then follows. The evaluation should also include diagnostic testing based on findings from the history and physical examination as well as the risks presented by the child‚Äôs previous living conditions. Age-appropriate screenings may include, but are not limited to, newborn screening panels and hearing, vision, dental, and formal behavioral and/or developmental screenings.

953,Elimination communication contributes to a reduction in unexplained infant crying,"The Normal Crying Curve refers to infants‚Äô unexplained crying from birth to a peak at about 6‚Äì8 weeks, and self-resolving by three months. However, it is known that infants signal their need to eliminate (micturate/defecate) through a variety of cues, including fussing and crying. Elimination Communication (EC) refers to a caregiver's nurturant response to infant cues, while also using timing, to gently and non-coercively cradle the infant in a supported, secure squatting position to eliminate. Such practices have been reported in ethnographic observations of hunter-gatherer care of infants, who cry less than minority world (Western) infants. We hypothesize that the current minority world practice of delayed toilet training and lack of caregiver response to elimination cues results in excessive, unexplained infant crying as infants eliminate in the constraints of diapers and in non-beneficial postures. As a corollary, we hypothesize that EC will reduce unexplained infant crying in the early months, perhaps even planating the Normal Crying Curve. To evaluate our hypothesis, we designed a pilot study to collect empirical data from mothers who practiced EC with their infants, tracking crying and fussing at Weeks 4, 6, 8 and 12 primarily utilizing a 24-hour Baby's Daily Diary. We computed baseline measures, compared our crying data with those from the literature, assessed our data for internal crying peaks, and used hierarchical multi-level modeling to evaluate cross-level interactions. We found that infants in our pilot study cried on average 50.3% less (p < 0.05), and up to 70.9% less in Week 6, compared to literature studies. Moreover, when we evaluated our data to seek out a significant crying peak across weeks, no such crying duration difference was found. Using hierarchical generalized linear modeling, we found that greater daily crying episodes predicted greater daily elimination opportunities. Shorter crying episodes predicted a greater number of daily elimination opportunities compared to longer crying episodes, especially among low baseline crying infants. Our results suggest that crying prompts caregivers to offer elimination opportunities, but when the crying continues, caregivers may try other behavioral responses, such as feeding. Additionally, our results suggest that with the practice of EC, unexplained infant crying may be significantly reduced and warrant future research with an expanded sample. If the practice of EC indeed planates the Normal Crying Curve, then such results will have a significant impact on our understanding of unexplained infant crying. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Jordan, G.

954,"Maternal anxiety following delivery, early infant temperament and mother's confidence in caregiving","A mother's emotional state is a well-known environmental factor that relates to the development of infant temperament. However, some relevant issues have not yet been fully explored. The current study examines the influence of determined maternal, contextual and perinatal variables on infant temperament and the mother's confidence in caregiving during the first weeks of life. A prospective study was carried out in three-hundred and seventeen newborns and their mothers. Perinatal and socio-demographic variables were recorded. The mother's anxiety and mood were measured in the first days after childbirth and again at 8 weeks. Infant temperament and the mother's confidence in caregiving were measured at 8 weeks. A mother's postpartum anxiety following delivery was the best predictor for most of the variables of infant temperament, including infant irritability (p =.001), and other child variables like infant sleep (p =.0003) and nursing difficulty (p =.001). Contextual-family variables, such as the number of people at home (p =.0024) and whether they were primiparous (p =.001), were the best predictors for a mother's confidence in caregiving. Support was found for an early effect of maternal anxiety on infant temperament. The results have clinical implications for postnatal psychological interventions.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical improvement was assessed using 18 symptoms/signs which were graded on a two-point recovery scale of 'rapid' and 'gradual', indicating improvement within 'four days' and 'beyond four days', respectively. RESULTS: Each intervention group consisted of 98 +/- 1 children having comparable clinico-epidemiological characteristics at the baseline. The trial revealed that most chesty features (features appearing to arise from chest, i.e. cough, breathing difficulty, wheeze, chest indrawing, tachypnoea, tachycardia, rhonchi and crepitation) demonstrated a gradual recovery, beyond 4th admission day and, not differing among the three intervention groups (p > 0.23, p < 0.62, p = 0.54, p < 0.27, p = 0.75, p = 0.76, p = 0.81, p > 0.98, respectively). Most non-chesty features (features appearing to arise away from chest, i.e. feeding/sleeping difficulties, social smile, restlessness, inconsolable crying, nasal flaring, fever and hypoxaemia) demonstrated a rapid recovery, within 4 days, remaining comparable among the three intervention groups (p < 0.07, p = 0.65, p = 0.24, p < 0.61, p = 0.22, p = 0.84, p = 0.29 and p = 0.96, respectively). However, nasal symptoms (runny nose and nasal blockage) also showed no difference among groups (p = 0.36 and p = 0.66, respectively). Thus, the dynamics of clinical outcome obviates that children not receiving antibiotics had similar clinical outcome than those who did. CONCLUSION: In hospital settings, managing bronchiolitis with only supportive measures but without antibiotics remains preferable.","Kabir, A. R. and Mollah, A. H. and Anwar, K. S. and Rahman, A.

960,Intimate partner violence and its association with maternal depressive symptoms 6-8 months after childbirth in rural Bangladesh,"Background: The prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV), a gross violation of human rights, ranges widely across the world with higher prevalence reported in low- and middle-income countries. Evidence related mainly to physical health shows that IPV has both direct and indirect impacts on women's health. Little is known about the impact of IPV on the mental health of women, particularly after childbirth. Objective: To describe the prevalence of IPV experienced by women 6-8 months after childbirth in rural Bangladesh and the factors associated with physical IPV. The study also aims to investigate the association between IPV and maternal depressive symptoms after childbirth. Design: The study used cross-sectional data at 6-8 months postpartum. The sample included 660 mothers of newborn children. IPV was assessed by physical, emotional, and sexual violence. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale assessed maternal depressive symptoms. Results: Prevalence of physical IPV was 52%, sexual 65%, and emotional 84%. The husband's education (OR: 0.41, CI: 0.23-0.73), a poor relationship with the husband (OR: 2.64, CI: 1.07-6.54), and emotional violence by spouse (OR: 1.58, CI: 1.35-1.83) were significantly associated with physical IPV experienced by women. The perception of a fussy and difficult child (OR: 1.05, CI: 1.02-1.08), a poor relationship with the husband (OR: 4.95, CI: 2.55-9.62), and the experience of physical IPV (OR: 2.83, CI: 1.72-4.64) were found to be significant predictors of maternal depressive symptoms among women 6-8 months after childbirth. Neither forced sex nor emotional violence by an intimate partner was found to be significantly associated with maternal depressive symptoms 6-8 months postpartum. Conclusions: It is important to screen for both IPV and depressive symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum. Since IPV and spousal relationships are the most important predictors of maternal depressive symptoms in this study, couple-focused interventions at the community level are suggested. ¬© 2014 Zarina N.

961,Effects of access to a stimulating object on infant behavior during tummy time,"Placing infants in a prone position for ""tummy time"" often is recommended to ensure appropriate infant development and to combat the effects associated with infants spending extended periods of time in a supine position. However, tummy time may be associated with inappropriate infant behavior such as crying and noncompliance. We provided continuous access to a preferred stimulus to decrease negative vocalizations and to increase the duration of an infant's head being elevated during tummy time.","Kadey, H.

963,Behavioral interventions for infant sleep problems: The role of parental cry tolerance and sleep-related cognitions,"Study Objectives: This study tested whether parental cry tolerance (PCT) and distress-attribution cognitions predict outcomes of behavioral interventions for infant sleep problems. It additionally examined intervention effects on these parental factors. Methods: Participants were 91 infants aged 9-18 months (61% boys) with sleep-related problems and their parents. Families were randomized to 1 of 2 behavioral interventions for infant sleep problems: Checking-in or Camping-out. Assessments were completed at baseline and 1-month post-treatment. Infant sleep was assessed using actigraphy and parent reports on the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. PCT was measured using the Intervention Delay to Infant Crying Video laboratory paradigm, and parental distress-attribution cognitions were assessed via the Infant Sleep Vignettes Interpretation Scale. Results: Higher PCT and lower parental distress-attribution cognitions at baseline predicted greater improvement in parent-reported sleep problems post-treatment, and higher PCT additionally predicted larger reductions in the number of reported nighttime awakenings. Moreover, PCT increased, and distress-attribution decreased, following the interventions. Conclusions: Parent factors both predict and are predicted by behavioral interventions for infant sleep problems. This study's findings suggest that parents with low cry tolerance and high distress-attribution cognitions derive less benefit from these interventions and may thus require augmented care.

964,Immunological programming by breast milk creates an anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu in breast-fed infants compared to formula-fed infants,"Breast milk provides important maturational stimuli to an infant's developing immune system. However, data concerning the role of breast-feeding in reducing the risk of allergic disease remain contradictory. Previous studies have centred on comparative analyses of breast milk and formula compositions. We chose a slightly different angle, whereby we focused on the effects of the chosen diet on the infant himself, comparing the immune development of formula-fed and breast-fed children. The objective of the present study was to determine how the mode of feeding affects infant immunology. Altogether, eighteen formula-fed infants with limited breast-feeding for < 3 months and twenty-nine infants who were exclusively breast-fed for >3 months were included in the study. Concentrations of interferon Œ≥, TNF-Œ± IL-10, IL-5, IL-4 and IL-2 were measured simultaneously from the same serum sample through use of a multiplexed flow cytometric assay at the ages of 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Transforming growth factor Œ≤2 (TGF-Œ≤2) was measured using ELISA at the same time points. Serum TNF-Œ± and IL-2 concentrations were significantly higher in formula-fed than in breast-fed infants during the first year of life (ANOVA, P= 0¬∑002). The serum concentrations of TGF-Œ≤ were significantly lower in formula-fed than in breast-fed infants throughout the first year of life (ANOVA, P‚â§ 0¬∑0001). Exclusive breast-feeding promotes an anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu, which is maintained throughout infancy. Such an immunological environment limits hyper-responsiveness and promotes tolerisation, possibly prohibiting the onset of allergic disease.

965,Association between In-Hospital Pacifier Use and Breastfeeding Continuation and Exclusivity: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Admission as a Possible Effect Modifier,"Background: Breastfeeding dyads frequently use pacifiers during the birth hospitalization, but the relationships between this exposure and breastfeeding continuation and exclusivity remain unclear. Materials and Methods: In this secondary analysis of cross-sectional survey data from the CDC Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) from 10 U.S. states (AK, AR, CO, ME, MN, NJ, NY, OR, TX, and VT) from 2009 to 2011, we assessed to what extent pacifier use during the birth hospitalization is independently associated with any and exclusive breastfeeding ‚â•10 weeks. Results: A total of 37,628 mothers who were chosen by random birth certificate sampling completed surveys at ‚àº4 months postpartum. Adjusting for multiple pro-breastfeeding hospital practices and maternal and infant demographic characteristics, pacifier exposure during the birth hospitalization was independently associated with decreased odds of breastfeeding ‚â•10 weeks (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]) 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.80, p < 0.0001) and exclusive breastfeeding ‚â•10 weeks (aOR 0.70, 95% CI 0.63-0.79, p < 0.0001) among infants admitted to the well-baby nursery, but not among those admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Conclusions: In this population study of mothers from 10 U.S. states, pacifier use during the birth hospitalization was associated with decreased odds of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding ‚â•10 weeks among well-newborn, but not NICU-admitted infants. Pacifier use may be a marker rather than a cause of breastfeeding difficulties, but prospective, randomized studies are needed to help clarify this. Future studies exploring pacifier exposure and breastfeeding outcomes should account for NICU admission as an effect modifier. Copyright ¬© 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2017.","Kair, L.

967,Pacifier restriction and exclusive breastfeeding,"OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that removing pacifiers from routine distribution in our mother-baby unit (MBU) would be associated with greater breastfeeding initiation or exclusivity during the birth hospitalization. METHODS: We retrospectively compared exclusive breastfeeding, breastfeeding plus supplemental formula feeding, and exclusive formula feeding rates for 2249 infants admitted to the MBU at our university teaching hospital during the 5 months before and 8 months after restriction of routine pacifier distribution. Formula supplementation, if not medically indicated, was discouraged per standard practice, but access to formula was not restricted. RESULTS: Of the 2249 infants, 79% were exclusively breastfed from July through November 2010, when pacifiers were routinely distributed. During the 8-month period after pacifier restriction, this proportion decreased significantly to 68% (P < .001). A corresponding increase from 18% to 28% was observed in the number of breastfed infants receiving supplemental formula feeds in the same period (P < .001). During the study period, the proportion of exclusively formula-fed infants increased from 1.8% to 3.4% (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Restricting pacifier distribution during the newborn hospitalization without also restricting access to formula was associated with decreased exclusive breastfeeding, increased supplemental formula feeding, and increased exclusive formula feeding. Because high-quality, prospective medical literature addressing pacifier use and breastfeeding does not conclusively show an adverse relationship in women who are motivated to breastfeed, more studies are needed to help determine what effect, if any, pacifiers have on breastfeeding initiation and exclusivity in the immediate newborn period.

968,Mothers' dopamine receptor polymorphism modulates the relation between infant fussiness and sensitive parenting,"We determined whether the combination of the 48-bp variable number tandem repeat polymorphism of the dopamine (DRD4) gene and infants' (fussy-difficult) temperament predicted parenting sensitivity. The sample was comprised of 147 mothers and their 6-month olds. Sensitive parenting was assessed by coding filmed interactions between mothers and infants. Infant temperament was assessed by parents' reports on a standard questionnaire. Moderated regressions models, with maternal education and infants' interactive behavior as controls, were used to test our hypotheses. Results showed no main effects of either temperament or DRD4, though the maternal DRD4 √ó infant temperament interaction was significant. Probes indicated that parents with a DRD4 7-repeat allele behaved more sensitively to fussier infants and less sensitively to less fussy infants compared to parents without the 7-repeat allele. Among those parents, sensitivity did not vary with infant temperament. This pattern of results indicates that mothers are differentially susceptible to infant fussiness, dependent on the presence of the 7-repeat DRD4 allele. ¬© 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Kaitz, M. and Shalev, I. and Sapir, N. and Devor, N. and Samet, Y. and Mankuta, D. and Ebstein, R.

972,What can the gut microbiome teach us about the connections between child physical and mental health? A systematic review,"A deeper understanding of the gut‚Äìbrain axis is of significance in pediatrics, given the influential role of early childhood experiences and exposures in shaping the microbiome, and health, across the life course. This systematic review synthesized evidence on the connection between the gut microbiome and mental health in children with physical illness. Six electronic databases were systematically searched and data extracted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Of 1,476 identified articles, 11 articles reporting on nine unique studies (all randomized controlled trials) were included. Most studies examined the gut microbiome in infants with colic, while the remaining studies investigated outcomes in children aged 1¬†day to 18¬†years at risk for atopic dermatitis or irritable bowel syndrome. Baseline and postintervention gut microbiome differences varied across studies. Findings on psychological functioning also varied, with only half of the captured studies showing a positive effect of intervention on psychological well-being. Only two studies analyzed the association between the gut microbiome and psychological outcomes, each with a different pattern of results. As the field moves forward, it will be critical to gain a better understanding of the microbiome characteristics that influence mental health outcomes in pediatric populations. ¬© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Kan, J.

973,"Safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine containing aluminum phosphate adjuvant administered at 2, 3 and 4 months of age","The primary aim of this study was to assess the tolerability and immunogenicity of a new Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)/AlPO4 (CHIRON, SpA) vaccine, in two-month-old healthy infants. Twenty-three subjects were enrolled and administered the new Hib vaccine containing AlPO4 adjuvant at two, three and four months of age concomitantly with diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) and hepatitis B vaccines according to the local program. Children were observed for 30 minutes after each immunization for any immediate local and systemic reactions. An active surveillance for side effects was performed on the 2nd and 7th days following each immunization by telephone. Families also filled out diaries for the first seven days. From the 2nd day to the next immunization only data about adverse events necessitating a physician's visit or about serious adverse events were collected. Blood samples were obtained before the first immunization and one month after the third dose for evaluation of anti-polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) antibody response. Local reactions at the Hib site were mild and less frequent compared to those observed at the DPT site. Systemic reactions noted after the three immunizations were fever in 70 percent, irritability in 48 percent, persistent crying in 26 percent, change in eating habits in 22 percent, diarrhea in 17 percent, sleepiness in 17 percent, vomiting in 9 percent, and unusual crying in 4 percent of the cases. There was no serious adverse event. One hundred percent and 95 percent of children achieved an anti-PRP antibody response over 0.15 microg/ml and 1.0 microg/ml, respectively. The geometric mean titer was 15 microg/ml and the geometric mean ratio 84. It was concluded that the new (Hib)/AlPO4 vaccine is safe and well tolerated, and induced a good PRP antibody response in healthy two-month-old infants.","Kanra, G. and Viviani, S. and Yurdak√∂k, K. and Ozmert, E. and Yal√ßin, S. and Baldini, A. and Mutlu, B. and Kara, A. and Ceyhan, M. and Podda, A.",0,777

Rates of prolonged crying were similar between groups at each visit. OBJECTIVES: To compare the frequencies of unusual, high-pitched crying between recipients of COMVAX plus placebo and recipients of PedvaxHIB plus RECOMBIVAX HB following the second vaccine doses (primary) and to summarize the frequency of unusual, high-pitched crying and prolonged crying after each vaccination visit. DESIGN: We enrolled 1215 healthy infants in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study. Participating infants received study vaccines at 2 and 4 months of age and other routine childhood vaccines at 6-7 weeks and 3 months of age. Crying was evaluated via questionnaire at the time of enrollment (baseline) and daily from days 0 to 2 after each injection. RESULTS: Reports of unusual, high-pitched crying and prolonged crying were uncommon (<1%) prior to the first vaccination visit and were comparable in both treatment groups.

The aim of this study is to determine the incidence rate of adverse events following immunization with pentavalent vaccine (DTPw-Hep B-Hib (PRP-T) vaccine (pentavac) (adsorbed) is manufactured by Serum Institute of India ltd), which was introduced in Iran in November 2014. It is important to monitor vaccine-related adverse events because of the role of vaccine safety in immunization program success. METHODS: This study was a mixed cohort study that included 1119 children less than 1 year of age. In 2015, the children were referred to Hamadan health centers to receive pentavalent vaccine at 2, 4 and 6¬†months of age. The data were collected from the parents of the children using a questionnaire that was administered either face-to-face or by telephone. The cumulative incidence of side effects and risk ratio was reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Chi-squared tests and logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between the variables. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence rate of pentavalent-related adverse events during 48¬†h following immunization was estimated to be 15.8% for swelling, 10.9% for redness, 44.2% for pain, 12.6% for mild fever, 0.1% for high fever, 20.0% for drowsiness, 15.0% for loss of appetite, 32.9% for irritability, 4.6% for vomiting and 5.5% for persistent crying. There is no evidence for the occurrence of convulsion and encephalopathy among children who receive pentavalent vaccines. CONCLUSION: Further large studies with long time follow up are required to address rare events include convulsions, encephalopathy or persistent crying. However, Findings urge immunization programs to use pentavalent vaccinations and to continue implementing the current immunization program in children under 1 year of age.","Karami, M. and Ameri, P. and Bathaei, J. and Berangi, Z. and Pashaei, T. and Zahiri, A. and Zahraei, S.

This article uses a Brazelton infant behavior perspective to describe a rationale and methodology for this family-centered nursing intervention. It offers the nurse detailed suggestions for observing and identifying infant states, interpreting infant behavior, calming and orienting newborns, and eliciting selected reflexes. In this approach, the nurse assumes an expanded role as a facilitator of infant-parent interaction. The baby's behavior and the bath experience are used to engage parents with their newborns. The nurse encourages parents to observe, touch, and respond to their infants in order to develop more responsive parenting skills and better enjoy their babies. The interactive approach can enrich nursing practice by transforming the standard newborn bath into an exploratory adventure in which the nurse joins with parents to better understand and respond to the newest member of their family.","Karl, D.

980,Maternal influence on child hpa axis: A prospective study of cortisol levels in hair,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate cortisol concentrations in hair as biomarker of prolonged stress in young children and their mothers and the relation to perinatal and sociodemographic factors. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 100 All Babies In Southeast Sweden study participants with repeated measures at 1, 3, 5, and 8 years and their mothers during pregnancy. Prolonged stress levels were assessed through cortisol in hair. A questionnaire covered perinatal and sociodemographic factors during the child's first year of life. RESULTS: Maternal hair cortisol during the second and third trimester and child hair cortisol at year 1 and 3 correlated. Child cortisol in hair levels decreased over time and correlated to each succeeding age, between years 1 and 3 (r = 0.30, P = .002), 3 and 5 (r = 0.39, P , .001), and 5 and 8 (r = 0.44, P , .001). Repeated measures gave a significant linear association over time (P , .001). There was an association between high levels of hair cortisol and birth weight (b = .224, P = .020), nonappropriate size for gestational age (b = .231, P = .017), and living in an apartment compared with a house (b = .200, P = .049). In addition, we found high levels of cortisol in hair related to other factors associated with psychosocial stress exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Correlation between hair cortisol levels in mothers and their children suggests a heritable trait or maternal calibration of the child's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Cortisol output gradually stabilizes and seems to have a stable trait. Cortisol concentration in hair has the potential to become a biomarker of prolonged stress, especially applicable as a noninvasive method when studying how stress influences children's health.

981,"Early psychosocial exposures, hair cortisol levels, and disease risk","BACKGROUND: Early psychosocial exposures are increasingly recognized as being crucial to health throughout life. A possible mechanism could be physiologic dysregulation due to stress. Cortisol in hair is a new biomarker assessing long-term hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. The objective was to investigate whether early-life adverse psychosocial circumstances influence infant cortisol levels in hair and health outcomes in children prospectively until age 10. METHODS: A cohort study in the general community using a questionnaire covering 11 psychosocial items in the family during pregnancy and the cumulative incidence of diagnoses until age 10 years in 1876 children. Cortisol levels in hair were measured by using a radioimmunoassay in those with sufficient hair samples at age 1, yielding a subsample of n = 209. RESULTS: Children with added psychosocial exposures had higher infant cortisol levels in hair (B = 0.40, P < .0001, adjusted for gender and size for gestational age) in a cumulative manner and were significantly more often affected by 12 of the 14 most common childhood diseases, with a general pattern of increasing odds ratios. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the model of physiologic dysregulation as a plausible mechanism by which the duration and number of early detrimental psychosocial exposures determine health outcomes. The model indicates that the multiplicity of adversities should be targeted in future interventions and could help to identify children who are at high risk of poor health. Furthermore, given the prolonged nature of exposure to a stressful social environment, the novel biomarker of cortisol in hair could be of major importance.

987,Associations between mothers' active engagement with infants at 6 months and children's adjustment to school life at ages 5.5 and 11 years,"Background: In Japan, students' poor adjustment to school life such as school refusals has been recognized as a nation-wide problem. In this study, we examined the link between the absence of mothers' active engagement with their infants at 6 months and children's risks of poor adjustment toward elementary school life at the ages of 5.5 and 11. Methods: We used a Japanese national longitudinal survey (n = 43 132) with 11 years of follow-up. Because of social patterning in how mothers engage with their infants, we employed propensity score matching analyses to control for confounding by socio-economic and other factors. We matched mothers with active engagement and those without on various social and parental characteristics such as educational attainment and household income. Results and Conclusions: Among matched pairs, we observed higher risks of poor adjustment to school life at both 5.5 and 11 years among Japanese children who lacked mothers' active engagement at 6 months. For example, the relative risk was 1.46 [95% confidence interval: 1.10, 1.94] for inability to get along with others in a group setting at the age of 5.5 years and 1.29 [1.10, 1.51] for inability to get along with teachers at the age of 11 years. Our findings corroborate previous findings, which emphasize the importance of providing an enriched environment for infants' social development and may indicate the need for an intervention for caregivers who lack appropriate nurturing skills. ¬© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Kato, T. and Fujiwara, T. and Kawachi, I.",0,787

All infants had a eutectic mixture of local anesthetic cream applied before circumcision. The duration of the crying and grimacing were measured. RESULTS: The Gomco procedure took 1.9 times longer to complete. Infants who were circumcised with the Mogen procedure cried and grimaced far less than infants who were circumcised with the Gomco procedure (P =.0001). Sucrose on a pacifier was far more analgesic than water on a pacifier for infants in the Gomco group. CONCLUSION: On the basis of these and other findings on pain prevention and amelioration, we recommend that a local anesthetic be administered in advance of circumcision and that the Mogen procedure be used, unless contraindicated. We also recommend that infants be given a sweetened pacifier before, during, and after circumcision if the Gomco method is used.","Kaufman, G. E. and Cimo, S. and Miller, L. W. and Blass, E.

989,"Feeding during the first three months of life for infants of a cohort in Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Objective: To study the feeding pattern in the first three months of babies born in the Pelotas city, in Sothern Brazil. Methods: Prospective cohort study, with babies born between september 2002 and may 2003. Among 2,741 babies whose mothers were interviewed at the maternity ward, a random sample of 30% was followed up on the first and third months of age. Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses were applied. Variables with a p<0.05 were considered as associated. Results: 951 babies were followed up on the first month, 60% were under exclusive maternal breastfeeding, and 10% were already weaned. Smoking during pregnancy, father's educational level lower than four years and the use of a pacifier were associated to weaning. On the third month, 29% had been weaned, 39% received maternal milk exclusively, and 59% were bottle fed. Smoking during pregnancy, father schooling and the use of a pacifier were associated with weaning. There was an increase in the pacifier use - from 56 to 66% between the first and the third month of life. Conclusions: When compared to previous studies, an improvement on the rates of breastfeeding was shown, though still lower than World Health Organization recommendations, which highlights the need for stimulation of exclusive breastfeeding during prenatal care and during the first months after birth.","Kaufmann, C.

990,Breastfeeding practices and health-seeking behavior for neonatal sickness in a rural community,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the knowledge of mothers and grandmothers regarding breastfeeding and health-seeking behavior for neonatal sickness in a rural community. A cross-sectional survey, using a triangulation of qualitative (focus group discussion) and quantitative (structured questionnaire) methods was carried out. Although most of the grandmothers and mothers believed in early feeding within 2 h of delivery, they often administered prelacteal feeds such as ghutti and honey. Colostrum was considered beneficial. Most respondents believed that ghutti, water, or both should be given along with breastmilk. Diluted buffalo milk was the preferred choice if supplementation was required. It was thought that weaning should be introduced after 6 months of life. Mothers preferred to give dalia and khichri as the initial weaning food compared to roti and dal water by grandmothers. Both grandmothers and mothers felt that a baby who was playful and not crying excessively was usually healthy. Most of the respondents described the normal pattern of breathing, feeding, urination, and defecation adequately. Most of the grandmothers and mother's felt that by touching forehead and limbs of baby could reliably assess temperature. Refusal to feed was considered as a marker of a sickness by most grandmothers and mothers. However, they also believed that health-seeking for poor feeding could be delayed for 1 day. Respiratory distress was described by the presence of fast respiration, chest retractions, or noisy breathing. Most respondents did not know how to assess cyanosis or seizures. Jaundice was descried as yellowish discoloration of skin, eyes, and urine. Failure to pass urine for 4-6 h bothered most of the respondents. The first response to illness was home remedies. The choice of healthcare was unqualified village practitioners followed by government hospital. Knowledge regarding desirable breastfeeding practices was inadequate and quite a few inappropriate beliefs were widely prevalent. Although knowledge regarding sickness was present, health-seeking from qualified providers was considerably delayed with most respondents preferring village practitioners to government hospitals.","Kaushal, M. and Aggarwal, R. and Singal, A. and Shukla, H. and Kapoor, S.

991,Exploring why junk foods are 'essential' foods and how culturally tailored recommendations improved feeding in Egyptian children,"In Egypt, the double burden of malnutrition and rising overweight and obesity in adults mirrors the transition to westernized diets and a growing reliance on energy-dense, low-nutrient foods. This study utilized the trials of improved practices (TIPs) methodology to gain an understanding of the cultural beliefs and perceptions related to feeding practices of infants and young children 0-23 months of age and used this information to work in tandem with 150 mothers to implement feasible solutions to feeding problems in Lower and Upper Egypt. The study triangulated in-depth interviews (IDIs) with mothers participating in TIPs, with IDIs with 40 health providers, 40 fathers and 40 grandmothers to gain an understanding of the influence and importance of the role of other caretakers and health providers in supporting these feeding practices. Study findings reveal high consumption of junk foods among toddlers, increasing in age and peaking at 12-23 months of age. Sponge cakes and sugary biscuits are not perceived as harmful and considered 'ideal' common complementary foods. Junk foods and beverages often compensate for trivial amounts of food given. Mothers are cautious about introducing nutritious foods to young children because of fears of illness and inability to digest food. Although challenges in feeding nutritious foods exist, mothers were able to substitute junk foods with locally available and affordable foods. Future programming should build upon cultural considerations learned in TIPs to address sustainable, meaningful changes in infant and young child feeding to reduce junk foods and increase dietary quality, quantity and frequency. ¬© 2014 The Authors.

992,Consumption of obesogenic foods in non-Hispanic black mother‚Äìinfant dyads,"Obesity continues to be a problem in the United States. Of particular concern is the epidemic of early childhood obesity. A significant predictor of child diet is maternal diet, but little is known about this relationship during infancy. This study examined the association between maternal and infant consumption of key food groups from 6 to 18¬†months using data from the Infant Care, Feeding, and Risk of Obesity Study, a prospective cohort of 217 non-Hispanic black, low-income, first-time mothers. Using data from 24-hr dietary recalls collected during in-home visits at 6, 9, 12, and 18¬†months, we assessed longitudinal associations between mother and child intake of both energy-dense, nutrient-poor (obesogenic) food groups and fibre-, nutrient-rich food groups using random intercept logistic regression. Both mothers and their infants had high intake of sugar-sweetened beverages, desserts, and sweets and low intake of vegetables and whole grains. Infant consumption of key food groups was strongly associated with maternal consumption, suggesting the need for focused interventions to target maternal diet as a pathway to decreasing risk for the establishment of poor dietary patterns early in life. ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Kay, M.

993,Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and infantile colic,"aim. Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and infantile colic (IC) are heterogeneous diseases which's cause are unknown. Besides the different hypotheses in the etiology of both disorders maldevelopment in the metabolism of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system have been implicated. The goal of this study is to investigate the relationship between IC and ADHD due to possible common etiological factor as maldevelopment in neurochemical process. Methods. A case-control study was carried out. The sample included 114 (77.2% male) children who were medically diagnosed with AD/HD and 149 (67.1% male) healthy children who were chosen from the same hospital's pediatric clinic as the control group. Parents and teachers completed the Conners Parent Rating Scale (CPRS), Conners Teacher Rating Scale (CTRS) and the patients were evaluated with The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV). The parents were asked questions on a survey form filled out. IC was defined according to Wessel's modified criteria. Results. The mean age of AD/HD group was 10.14¬±2.48 years and 9.94¬±2.34 years in the non-AD/HD group. The rate of IC in AD/ HD and non-AD/HD groups were 50.0% and 30.2%, respectively and the difference was statistically significant between two groups (P=0.001). Duration of IC was similar in the groups (P=143). Conclusion. IC may be a postnatal risk factor and marker for AD/HD during childhood. Both diseases may have a common mecha-nism. Such infants need to be examined and followed up more intensively.","Kaymaz, N. and Uzun, M. E. and Cevizci, S. and Yildirim, S. and Il√ßin, M. and Topaloƒüolu, N. and Binnetoƒülu, F.

994,A trial of lactase in the management of infant colic,"Objective: To investigate transient lactose intolerance as a factor in the aetiology of infant colic. Design: We undertook a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of lactase and placebo drops added to milk formula to determine whether this method of reducing lactose intake affected infant colic. Subjects: Infants with colic were referred from clinics in keeping with Wessel's modified criteria. Interventions: Infants were randomly allocated to add either lactase or placebo drops to their formula feeds for 1 week, followed by 2 days 'wash out'. The addition was changed for the second week so that subjects served as their own control. The formulas were kept refrigerated for 24 h before ingestion. The parents kept a diary of their baby's crying time. Results: Thirteen babies completed the trial, of whom nine were boys. The mean birth weight was 3.7 kg (8.2 lb). Colic symptoms began in less than 1 month in 12 of the babies. The effect of the lactase was to reduce crying time by 1.14 h per day (CI 0.23-2.05). The reduction in crying time was significant (t = 2.75, d.f. = 11, P = 0.019). Conclusion: Transient lactose intolerance may have a role in the aetiology of infant colic. Lactase drops require prior incubation with milk formula to be effective. The response to lactase in this study supports 'colic', i.e. spasm of the large intestine as a factor in these infants' discomfort.","Kearney, P. J. and Malone, A.

995,Separation protest in day-care and home-reared infants,"Separation protest was measured by the onset and duration of fretting or crying in 24 day-care and 28 home-reared infants during a two-minute period of isolated separation from their mothers in an unfamiliar room. Separation episodes were repeated under similarly controlled circumstances at two-month intervals from 3 1/2 through 13 1/2 months and at 20 months of age. The composition of the day-care and home-reared groups was similar for sex, ordinal position, and family background. Day-care and home-reared infants showed similar patterns in the manifestation of separation protest over age, with sharp reductions in latency to crying and marked increases in the occurrence of crying at 9 1/2 and 13 1/2 months. These results suggest that the psychological processes underlying separation protest are not materially altered by the continuing presence of the young infant in a day-care program designed to meet both his physical and psychological requirements.","Kearsley, R.

998,The effects of music listening on inconsolable crying in premature infants,"Over the decades, medical staff have developed strategies to manage crying episodes of the critically ill and convalescing premature infant. These episodes of crying occur frequently after infants are removed from ventilation, but before they are able to receive nutrition orally. Not only are these episodes stressful to infants and upsetting to parents, but they are also stressful and time consuming for the staff that take care of these patients. Although the literature supports the benefits of music therapy in regard to physiological and certain behavioral measures with premature infants, no research exists that explores the use of music therapy with inconsolability related to the ""nothing by mouth"" status. This study explored the effects of music therapy on the crying behaviors of critically ill infants classified as inconsolable. Twenty-four premature infants with gestational age 32-40 weeks received a developmentally appropriate music listening intervention, alternating with days on which no intervention was provided. The results revealed a significant reduction in the frequency and duration of episodes of inconsolable crying as a result of the music intervention, as well as improved physiological measures including heart rate, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, and mean arterial pressure. Findings suggest the viability of using recorded music in the absence of a music therapist or the maternal voice to console infants when standard nursing interventions are not effective.","Keith, D.

999,Psychobiological aspects of infant crying,"This study addresses the relationship between the amount of infant crying and maternal responsiveness to the infant's facial communicative cues during distress and non-distress situations. Maternal responsiveness is operationalized by (a) the contingent reactions in a latency time span which define the intuitive character of parental behaviours (200‚Äì800 ms) and by (b) an event-based coding system of maternal inappropriate behaviour. Infant states (crying, fussing, sleeping and waking hours) were assessed by means of diaries kept by the mothers. In two samples ( N‚ÄÇ=‚ÄÇ10, N‚ÄÇ=‚ÄÇ13, respectively), married, middle-class mothers (aged 23‚Äì38 yrs) were videotaped in free play situations with their healthy, firstborn children (aged 12‚Äì15 wks) in their family homes. Results show that there is a strong intersituational consistency of maternal behaviour, but context-sensitive components of maternal behaviour could also be found. The contingency of maternal reactions during the free play situation can be regarded as a predictor of the duration of the infant's crying measured by a maternal diary. The whole pattern of the results confirms the regulatory function of infant crying in the context of early caregiver‚Äìchild interactions.

1000,"Relationship between infant crying, birth complications, and maternal variables","The aim of the study is to identify factors influencing infants' crying behavior (total crying duration, length of crying bouts, and frequency of crying). The searching for variables explaining inter-individual differences requires a sufficient stability of the cry parameters at least over short time intervals. Thus, a second aim is to assess the intra-individual stability of the crying behavior in an age range from 3 to 12 months. Sixty-two mother-child dyads participated in the study. The results show substantial stabilities of the crying behavior of infants between 3 and 12 months of age. This is related to the amount of crying as well as to the pattern of crying shown by the children over a 24 h interval. The typical cry pattern is characterized by peaks at 12.00 h and early in the evening, although there are large individual differences between the children with regard to cry durations at each hour of the day. Regarding the cry durations at 3 months of age, birth complications and the perceived emotional atmosphere in the mothers' family of origin are the major contributing factors.

1002,Pure tone audiometry in children,"OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate performance of the children on pure tone audiometry (PTA), and role of age, concentration level (CL) and otitis media with effusion (OME) in testing process. METHODS: This study was prospectively performed on 100 consecutive children referred for PTA between 24 and 120 months of age. After the audiologists' decision on test technique, the followings were noted: CL (by using a visual analog scale), test duration, test convenience (TC) and the problems (interruption, delay, crying) during the test. By using pure tone averages (PTAv), mean hearing level (MHL) and mean gap (MG) were calculated. RESULTS: PTA was achieved in 90% of the children and PTAv of bone and air conduction in the both ears were obtained in 86% (play audiometry with earphones (PAE): 73%, conventional audiometry (CA): 22%). These ratios were not different between the children with and without OME. About 55% of the younger children than 36 months were failed in PTA, while this ratio was 4.5% in the children between 36 and 120 months. Only difference between PAE and CA tests was in MHL. In OME group, only TC was found to be lower. Correlation analysis showed that CL was correlated with age. Test duration was correlated with MG and MHL, but found to be dependent on only MG. Further, it was found that test choice of the audiologist was correlated with age and CL, but dependent on only CL.

1003,Discolored leg syndrome after vaccination--descriptive epidemiology,"Discoloration of the leg following vaccination is a relatively unknown entity. We carried out a study of discolored leg syndrome (DLS) during a 10-year consecutive period with the objective of characterizing DLS in infants following vaccination received in the Dutch National Vaccination Program as well as its occurrence and association with different vaccines. Discolored leg syndrome was defined as an even or patchy red, blue or purple discoloration of the leg(s) and/or leg petechiae with or without swelling. All reports of adverse events following immunization that were made to the passive surveillance system between 1994 and 2003 were included-a total of 1162 identified cases. Red, blue, purple discoloration and isolated petechiae were reported in 39, 19, 27 and 14% of these cases, respectively. Of these 1162 cases, 1105 were considered to be related to the vaccination, based on a predefined risk window with symptom onset after vaccination (48 h for discolorations and 2 weeks for petechiae). Of the 1105 cases, about 50% occurred after DTP-IPV+Hib1 vaccinations, and 30% occurred after DTP-IPV+Hib2 vaccinations. Discolored leg syndrome was frequently accompanied by fierce crying (78%). The median time interval between vaccination and the occurrence of DLS was 3.8 +/- 46.7 h, and the median duration was short (2 +/- 61.7 h). Advancing the vaccination schedule from 3 to 2 months of age caused a small increase in DLS. Discolored leg syndrome manifested mainly after the first and/or second vaccination. In addition to dose, the occurrence of DLS may be slightly age-dependent and self-limiting. The pathophysiology is unknown but may be the result of a vasomotor reaction. Future studies should elucidate the recurrence rate, identify risk factors and assess late outcomes.","Kemmeren, J. M. and Vermeer-de Bondt, P. E. and van der Maas, N. A.",0,802
1004,The relationship of temperament and children's crying behavior during a stressful situation,"Examined the relationship between maternal perception of children's temperament and crying behavior during a stressful situation. 30 mothers and their children participated in the study. The Carey Infant Temperament Questionnaire (W. B. Carey and S. C. McDevitt, 1978) was used to classify mothers' perceptions of children's temperament at age 8 mo into 1 of 4 categories: easy, slow to warm up, difficult, or intermediate. At 11 mo of age, children were videotaped during a strange situation procedure to observe and time their crying behavior. Analysis of the data revealed that children perceived by their mothers as having a difficult temperament cried 3 times more than children perceived by their mothers as having an easy temperament. In addition to crying less, children with an easy temperament interacted with the stranger and explored more than other children.

1005,Attitudes and expectations about music therapy for premature infants among staff in a neonatal intensive care unit,"BACKGROUND: Music appears to reduce stress in premature infants, but little is known about the attitudes and expectations about music among clinicians caring for these infants. The study questions were: a) would staff like to have music played in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), b) would they prefer live to recorded music, and c) how would their attitudes be affected by their profession and experience? DESIGN: Cross sectional survey of NICU staff in the winter of 2003. METHODS: Eligible subjects were 37 physicians and 150 nurses and other clinical staff in the NICU. After pilot testing and revision, the self-administered questionnaires contained 57 Likert type or multiple choice items. They were distributed by e-mail and in staff mailboxes with two reminders. Data were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics, Chi-square, and logistic regression. RESULTS: The response rate was 75%. Most were nurses and 27 were MD's. Most (84%) were female and most (70%) reported some previous musical training. The majority (68%) agreed that they would like to have music played in the NICU. Most agreed that music could reduce stress (86%) and crying (79%) and improve sleep (79%) in premature infants. Recorded was preferred to live music by more than 2:1. Attitudes were significantly associated with prior musical training, experience, and profession. CONCLUSIONS: NICU staff holds favorable attitudes toward music for premature infants. Music's effects on caregiver attitudes, mood and behavior may contribute to its impact on infants. Evaluation of the effects of music on infants needs to account for caregiver's expectations and behavior as well as direct effects on infants' physiology.","Kemper, K. and Martin, K. and Block, S.

1006,Comparison of temperaments of children with and without baby bottle tooth decay,"Several demographic studies have been done to identify children at risk for Baby Bottle Tooth Decay (BBTD). Discussions have described these children with Baby Bottle Tooth Decay as strong tempered, cranky, restless, and fussy. The parents of these children have acknowledged these behaviors. To determine whether there were differences in temperament, children with Baby Bottle Tooth Decay were compared with children without Baby Bottle Tooth Decay by assessing the nine temperament components described by the Toddler Temperament Scale (TTS) questionnaire. Parents completed the temperament questionnaire and ninety-two children between twelve and thirty-six months old were studied. Scores for the nine temperament components were tabulated and temperament difficulty was determined as defined by the authors of the toddler Temperament Scale. At-test comparison between the two groups revealed no significant difference for the nine temperament components. There was also no difference when comparing clusters of the nine components. The conclusion is that there is no difference in the temperaments between the group of children with Baby Bottle Tooth Decay and the comparison group of children without Baby Bottle Tooth Decay.","Kendrick, F. and Wilson, S. and Coury, D.

1007,Motor development of infants with positional plagiocephaly,"Concurrent with recommendations to place infants to sleep in supine, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of infants with positional plagiocephaly (PP). Recent evidence suggests that infants who have decreased exposure to prone position may have a higher incidence of PP and may be at risk for a delay in the acquisition of certain motor skills. The purpose of this study was to compare motor development between infants with PP and matched peers without PP. We also examined differences in infant positioning practices when asleep and awake between the two groups. Twenty-seven infants with PP, 3 to 8 months of age, were matched by age, gender, and race to infants without PP. Motor performance was evaluated using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (PDMS). Parents completed a diary that recorded infant positioning over a 3-day period. Mean AIMS percentile score for infants with PP was 31.1 ¬± 21.6 as compared with 42.7 ¬± 20.2 in infants without PP (p =.06). Better performance on the AIMS was positively correlated with the amount of time in prone position when awake, for both groups of children (PP r= .52, no PP r =.44, p <. 05). Therapists should be aware of a risk of a motor delay when evaluating infants with PP. It is also important for parents to be informed about the importance of supervised prone playtime to enhance the development of early motor skills. ¬© 2009 by Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Kennedy, E. and Majnemer, A. and Farmer, J.

1008,"Acoustic features of infant vocalic utterances at 3, 6, and 9 months","Recordings were obtained of the comfort-state vocalizations of infants at 3, 6, and 9 months of age during a session of play and vocal interaction with the infant's mother and the experimenter. Acoustic analysis, primarily spectrography, was used to determine utterance durations, formant frequencies of vocalic utterances, patterns of f0 frequency change during vocalizations, variations in source excitation of the vocal tract, and general properties of the utterances. Most utterances had durations of less than 400 ms although occasional sounds lasted 2 s or more. An increase in the ranges of both the F1 and F2 frequencies was observed across both periods of age increase, but the center of the F1-F2 plot for the group vowels appeared to change very little. Phonatory characteristics were at least generally compatible with published descriptions of infant cry. The f0 frequency averaged 445 Hz for 3-month-olds, 450 Hz for 6-month-olds, and 415 Hz for 9-month-olds. As has been previously reported for infant cry, the vocalizations frequently were associated with tremor (vibrato), harmonic doubling, abrupt f0 shift, vocal fry (or roll), and noise segments. Thus, from a strictly acoustic perspective, early cry and the later vocalizations of cooing and babbling appear to be vocal performances in continuity. Implications of the acoustic analyses are discussed for phonetic development and speech acquisition.","Kent, R. D. and Murray, A. D.",0,807
1009,Support for the global feasibility of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire as developmental screener,"Objective: To investigate the psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the 48¬†months Ages and Stages Questionnaire (D_ASQ_48). Design: Prospective cohort study of a community-based sample of children born in 2002 and 2003 whose parents filled out the D_ASQ_48 and a questionnaire on school status at 60¬†months. The ASQ was translated into Dutch and back-translated into English by three independent translators. Setting: Well Child Centers covering 25% of the Netherlands. Participants: Parents of 1510 preterm and 562 term children born in 2002-2003 attending routine Well Child visits at age 45-50¬†months. Main outcome measures: Reliability, validity and mean population scores for D_ASQ_48 compared to other countries. Results: Mean population scores for the D_ASQ_48 were mostly similar to those in the USA, Norway and Korea. Exceptions (effect sizes of difference > 0.5) were problem solving (USA) and fine motor (Korea). Reliability was good for the total score (Cronbach alpha 0.79) and acceptable for all domains (0.61-0.74). As expected, infants born at gestational age < 32¬†weeks, children from low income families, of low educated mothers, and boys were more likely to fail on several domains (odds ratios, OR ranging from 1.5 to 4.9). The only unexpected association concerned children from one-parent families. Sensitivity to predict special education at five years of age was 89% and specificity 80%. Conclusions: The good psychometric properties of the Dutch ASQ_48 and the small differences when compared to other countries support its usefulness in the early detection of developmental problems amongst children worldwide. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1010,A practical approach to classifying and managing feeding difficulties,"Many young children are thought by their parents to eat poorly. Although the majority of these children are mildly affected, a small percentage have a serious feeding disorder. Nevertheless, even mildly affected children whose anxious parents adopt inappropriate feeding practices may experience consequences. Therefore, pediatricians must take all parental concerns seriously and offer appropriate guidance. This requires a workable classification of feeding problems and a systematic approach. The classification and approach we describe incorporate more recent considerations by specialists, both medical and psychological. In our model, children are categorized under the 3 principal eating behaviors that concern parents: limited appetite, selective intake, and fear of feeding. Each category includes a range from normal (misperceived) to severe (behavioral and organic). The feeding styles of caregivers (responsive, controlling, indulgent, and neglectful) are also incorporated. The objective is to allow the physician to efficiently sort out the wide variety of conditions, categorize them for therapy, and where necessary refer to specialists in the field.

1012,COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTS OF PREEMPTIVE INTRAVENOUS AND RECTAL ACETAMINOPHEN ON PAIN MANAGEMENT AFTER INGUINAL HERNIORRHAPHY IN CHILDREN: A PLACEBO-CONTROLLED STUDY,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain management is a critical concern in pediatric surgery. Acetaminophen is the safest and most widely used analgesic in children. The present study compared the analgesic efficacy of intravenous (IV) and rectal acetaminophen versus placebo in children undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy. METHODS: A total of 120 children, who were candidate for elective surgical repair of unilateral inguinal hernia, were enrolled and randomly allocated to four groups of 30 patients each to receive IV acetaminophen, acetaminophen suppository, IV placebo, and placebo suppository during surgery. Postoperative pain scores, measured on the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale, were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The four groups had no significant differences in the mean age, weight, length of stay in the recovery room, and duration of operation. The frequency of postoperative vomiting was significantly lower in the IV and rectal acetaminophen groups compared to the two placebo groups (P = 0.04). The mean pain scores of the two acetaminophen groups were similar during the first two hours after surgery. These scores were significantly lower than the scores of the placebo groups. However, the four groups were not significantly different in terms of pain scores at the fourth, sixth, and 12th postoperative hours. During the first hour after surgery, IV acetaminophen had the largest analgesic effect. Moreover, among all four groups, the IV acetaminophen group had the highest sedation level in the recovery room. CONCLUSION: Both IV and rectal acetaminophen were more effective than placebo in pain relief after inguinal hernia repair in children. They were also associated with lower frequencies of postoperative vomiting. The greatest analgesic efficacy of both forms was observed during the first two hours after surgery.","Khalili, G.

1013,Resonance frequencies behavior in pathologic cries of newborns,"OBJECTIVE: A new approach to the automatic quantification of the acoustic parameters of the cries of healthy newborns and newborns with pathologies is presented. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship between acoustic parameters and pathologies of interest to characterize healthy and pathologic cries of newborns. METHODS: Using MATLAB, this study included automatic estimation of F0, RF1, RF2, percentage and tuning duration, transition duration, RF2 slope, and RF1:RF2 ratio. The database used includes full- and pre-term newborns, healthy, and pathologic cries. It contains 3000 cry samples of 1-second duration from 65 newborn babies aged from 1¬†day to 1¬†month old. RESULTS: Statistical analysis results reveal that the distributions of these acoustic cry parameters depend on the pathology of newborn. In this work, we successfully identify the quantitative relationship between the acoustic cry characteristics we examined and the diseases we studied. CONCLUSIONS: Our deduction is that quantification of the variability of these parameters is useful for differentiating the cries of a healthy newborn from those of a newborn with a pathology, and that these data can be used for the early diagnosis of newborn diseases.","Kheddache, Y. and Tadj, C.",0,811
1014,"Infantile colic, facts and fiction","Infantile colic is one of the major challenges of parenthood. It is one of the common reasons parents seek medical advice during their childs first 3 months of life. It is defined as paroxysms of crying lasting more than 3 hours a day, occurring more than 3 days in any week for 3 weeks in a healthy baby aged 2 weeks to 4 months. Colic is a poorly understood phenomenon affecting up to 30% of babies, underlying organic causes of excessive crying account for less than 5%. Laboratory tests and radiological examinations are unnecessary if the infant is gaining weight normally and has a normal physical examination. Treatment is limited and drug treatment has no role in management. Probiotics are now emerging as promising agents in the treatment of infantile colic. Alternative medicine (Herbal tea, fennel, glucose and massage therapy) have not proved to be consistently helpful and some might even be dangerous. In conclusion infantile colic is a common cause of maternal distress and family disturbance, the cornerstone of management remains reassurance of parents regarding the benign and self-limiting nature of the illness. There is a critical need for more evidence based treatment protocols. ¬© 2012 Kheir","Kheir, A. E. M.",0,812
1015,Trauma-Responsive Care in a Pediatric Setting: Feasibility and Acceptability of Screening for Adverse Childhood Experiences,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have demonstrable negative effects on long-term physical and mental health. Low-income and ethnic minority communities face significant disparities in exposure to ACEs. Pediatric settings offer an opportune context to identify and address ACEs, with the potential to reduce barriers in access to resources and services. The current study examined the feasibility and acceptability of screening infants and their parents for ACEs at a community medical clinic. Feasibility data indicated that 151 (92%) of the 164 unique patients that presented for well-child visits for infants (4- to 12-months) across a 13-month period were screened for infant and parent ACEs. Of these 151 patients, 47% met eligibility (infants with 1¬†+¬†ACEs, parents with 2¬†+¬†ACEs) deemed intermediate risk and indicated referral to prevention services. The majority of referred families (77%) accepted prevention services, including appointments with bilingual and bicultural wellness navigators who provided a cultural bridge and access to resources that could address patients‚Äô social determinants of health. Qualitative interviews with providers expand upon screening acceptability. Implications for integrated behavioral health, ACEs screening, and trauma-responsive prevention in a pediatric setting are discussed. ¬© 2019 Society for Community Research and Action","Kia-Keating, M. and Barnett, M.

1016,Synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: A randomised controlled trial,"Aim Infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. Results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. In a randomised clinical trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. Methods Fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion CFU of: Lactobacillus casei, L.√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞rhamnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, L.√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞acidophilus, B.√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞infantis, L.√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (Protexin Healthcare, Somerset, UK), or placebo daily for 30 days. Parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. The primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). Results The treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (P < 0.005). At day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (P < 0.01). Symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (P < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, P = 0.24). We encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. Conclusion This synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus FOS) significantly improved colic symptoms in comparison with placebo. ¬© 2014 The Authors.

Associated congenital malformations are present in 90 per cent of cases, most frequently affecting the cardiovascular or gastrointestinal systems and the genitourinary tract. Affected infants lack prenatal symptoms and usually present with severe respiratory distress, absence of audible crying and difficult or impossible endotracheal intubation, leading to failed airway management and irreversible cerebral hypoxia. The authors report an infant with tracheal agenesis who presented with respiratory failure after birth. The clinical features, embryology and classification schemes are presented in the hope of increasing awareness, thus making earlier diagnosis possible and thereby improving survival.","Kiatchoosakun, P. and Jirapradittha, J. and Taksaphan, S. and Teeratakulpisarn, J. and Nitinavakarn, B. and Tantisirin, C.",0,815

1019,Temperament and the mother-infant dyad: Associations with breastfeeding and formula feeding with a bottle,"Breastfeeding supports the formation of an emotional bond between mothers and their children. The feeding method is associated with both the child's temperament and the mother's perception of herself and the child. Therefore, the present study focuses on the feeding method, mothers' reaction during feeding, and infants' temperament traits. Ninety-eight mothers with children aged 3 to 5 months participated in the study. Children were assessed with the Children Development Scale (A. Matczak et al., 2007) to measure their temperament. Mothers completed the Mother and Baby Scale (D. Wolke & I. St James-Roberts, 1987, as cited in T.B. Brazelton & K. Nugent, 1995), which measures mothers' evaluation of their children's behaviors during feeding and their overall experiences with their children's care. The results show that breastfed newborns, as compared to bottle-fed newborns, demonstrate higher vigor, which includes activity and the intensity of reaction. Bottle-fed children demonstrate higher regularity than do breastfed children. Mothers who bottle-feed their children perceive themselves to be less confident in the feeding domain than do mothers who breastfeed. Our results indicate that children's temperament might be an important factor in the decision regarding the feeding method. The study supports the idea of promoting knowledge of children's behaviors during feeding among mothers even before their children are born, such as during antenatal classes. ¬© 2015 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.","Kielbratowska, B. and Kazmierczak, M. and Michalek, J. and Preis, K.",0,817

1023,Maternal Antenatal Depression and Early Childhood Sleep: Potential Pathways Through Infant Temperament,"Objective: Maternal depression is associated with infant and child sleep patterns, and with infant temperament. Here, we examine whether infant temperament mediated an association between maternal antenatal depression and toddler sleep. Method: Within the prebirth longitudinal cohort Growing Up in New Zealand, symptoms of antenatal and postnatal depression were measured in 5,568 women using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Infant temperament was measured at age 9 months using the Very Short Form of Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R VSF). Sleep duration and nighttime awakenings were reported by parents when children were 2 years old. Results: Independent associations of maternal depression with child sleep patterns at age 2 years, adjusted for maternal demographics, physical health, family relationships, and child health and feeding, were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The odds of having ‚â•2 nighttime awakenings were increased for children whose mothers had antenatal (1.36, 1.07-1.73) but not postnatal (1.22, 0.88-1.68) or both antenatal and postnatal depression (0.89, 0.56-1.36). There was no association of maternal depression with shorter sleep duration. Two of five dimensions of infant temperament (fear and negative affect) were associated with both antenatal depression scores and increased nighttime awakenings. Mediation analyses controlling for postnatal depression and other predictors of child sleep supported an indirect pathway of antenatal depression to child sleep through infant temperamental negative affectivity. Conclusion: Antenatal depression is independently associated with more frequent nighttime awakenings in early childhood. Findings support an indirect pathway through infant negative affect characteristics. ¬© 2019 The Author(s).","Kim, Y. and Bird, A. and Peterson, E. and Underwood, L. and Morton, S. M.

1025,Infants with colic have a normal sleep structure at 2 and 7 months of age,"Objective: To compare nighttime sleep structure between infants with colic and a control group. Study design: Sleep and cry times of 15 infants with colic and 16 infants in a control group were recorded with the use of a daily diary at the ages of 5 weeks and 6 months. The diary was kept at home for a 1-week period. Overnight polygraphic sleep recordings in a sleep laboratory were performed when the infants were 2 months of age and were repeated for 11 infants with colic and 14 infants in a control group at 7 months of age. Results: Daily sleep time was shorter in infants with colic compared with the control group at 5 weeks of age (P = .001). Polygraphic data showed a similar sleep structure between the study groups at 2 and 7 months of age. Infants with colic had somewhat more obstructive apneas during rapid eye movement sleep at the age of 2 months (P = .04), and they had fewer awakenings at the age of 7 months than the control group (P = .003). Conclusion: Infants with colic had normal sleep polygraphic finding at 2 and 7 months of age including sleep structure, movements, and breathing. Despite the shorter reported daily sleep times, the polygraphic data did not suggest infantile colic to be associated with a sleep disorder.","Kirjavainen, J. and Kirjavainen, T. and Huhtala, V. and Lehtonen, L. and Korvenranta, H. and Kero, P.",1,821
1026,Sleep of excessively crying infants: A 24-hour ambulatory sleep polygraphy study,"Objective. Parents' reports suggest that excessively crying or colicky infants sleep less compared with control subjects. The aim of this study was to determine the sleep-wake structure of excessively crying infants throughout a 24-hour cycle. Methods. A 24-hour sleep polygraphy study was conducted at home for 24 excessively crying infants and 23 control subjects at the age of 6 weeks. In addition, parental diaries were kept for 4 days. Results. In sleep polygraphy recordings, no major differences between study groups were observed in either the duration or the structure of the 24-hour sleep. In the diaries, the parents overestimated the amount of sleep in both study groups. The parents of the control infants overestimated the amount of sleep more than the parents of excessively crying infants (69.8 minutes [standard deviation: 79.3] compared with 27.1 minutes [standard deviation: 65.4], respectively). In excessively crying infants, the proportion of rapid eye movement sleep was higher during the 3-hour period from the beginning of the first long sleep in the evening and lower during the preceding 3-hour period compared with the control group. Conclusions. The results of this study suggest that diary-based studies are prone to be biased as the parents of the control infants are more likely to overestimate the amount of infant's sleep and, therefore, report more sleep than the parents of the crying infants. Although no differences in the total amount of sleep or proportions of sleep stages were observed, excessively crying infants may be characterized by a disturbance that affects rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep stage proportion during evening hours.

1028,Association between delayed bedtime and sleep-related problems among community-dwelling 2-year-old children in Japan,"Background: Although delayed sleep timing causes many socio-psycho-biological problems such as sleep loss, excessive daytime sleepiness, obesity, and impaired daytime neurocognitive performance in adults, there are insufficient data showing the clinical significance of a 'night owl lifestyle' in early life. This study examined the association between habitual delayed bedtime and sleep-related problems among community-dwelling 2-year-old children in Japan.Methods: Parents/caregivers of 708 community-dwelling 2-year-old children in Nishitokyo City, Tokyo, participated in the study. The participants answered a questionnaire to evaluate their child's sleep habits and sleep-related problems for the past 1 month.Results: Of the 425 children for whom complete data were collected, 90 (21.2%) went to bed at 22:00 or later. Children with delayed bedtime showed significantly more irregular bedtime, delayed wake time, shorter total sleep time, and difficulty in initiating and terminating sleep. Although this relationship indicated the presence of sleep debt in children with delayed bedtime, sleep onset latency did not differ between children with earlier bedtime and those with delayed bedtime. Rather, delayed bedtime was significantly associated with bedtime resistance and problems in the morning even when adjusting for nighttime and daytime sleep time.Conclusions: Even in 2-year-old children, delayed bedtime was associated with various sleep-related problems. The causal factors may include diminished homeostatic sleep drive due to prolonged daytime nap as well as diurnal preference (morning or night type) regulated by the biological clock. ¬© 2015 Kitamura et al.","Kitamura, S. and Enomoto, M. and Kamei, Y. and Inada, N. and Moriwaki, A. and Kamio, Y. and Mishima, K.",0,824

Clinical presentations included vomiting (89.5%), abdominal pain and/or irritable crying (89.5%), fever (52.6%), bloody stools (26.3%), palpable abdominal masses (15.8%), hematemesis (10.5%), jaundice (5.3%), and seizures (5.3%). The duration between symptom onset and hospitalization ranged between 20 and 336 hours (average 75.8 hours). Two patients with suspected appendicitis and small bowel obstruction were operated on promptly. Sonograms revealed target lesions (average diameter 2.9 cm) suggestive of intussusception in 13 out of 17 patients, with 10 lesions located in the paraumbilical or left abdominal regions. Barium enemas in 12 of these 13 patients demonstrated no colonic lesions. Diagnosis and surgery were delayed in 16 patients (average delay = 32 hours). The remaining 1 patient with positive sonographic findings underwent early surgery after computed tomographic (CT) confirmation of SBI. Surgery revealed ileoileal intussusceptions in 11 patients, jejunojejunal in 4, jejunoileal in 3, and duodenojejunal in 1. Eight patients had lead points. Bowel complications (ischemia, necrosis, or perforation) occurred in 8 patients. The duration between symptom onset and surgery in patients with bowel complications was significantly longer than for patients without complications (p = 0.0026). In conclusion, delayed diagnosis and surgical treatment in symptomatic pediatric patients with SBI were common, leading to a high rate (42%) of bowel complications.

Methods: 83 primiparous women with infants aged 0-12. months admitted to a residential parent-infant program participated in a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV diagnosis of depressive and anxiety disorders and completed questionnaires assessing psychological distress, adult attachment and childhood parenting experiences. During their residential stay, nurses recorded infant behaviour using 24-hour charts. Results: Results showed PSE to be inversely correlated with maternal depression, maternal anxiety and attachment insecurity. Low levels of parental abuse during childhood, avoidant attachment, male infant gender and depressive symptom severity were found to predict low PSE. Major depression mediated the relation between attachment insecurity and PSE, but there were no links between PSE and infant behaviour. After the intervention, there was a significant improvement in PSE, with abusive parenting during childhood and depressive symptom severity being predictive of change. Conclusions: This study highlights the links between maternal psychopathology and maternal background factors such as childhood parenting experiences and attachment style in the development of postnatal PSE.

Methods Eighty-three primiparous women admitted to a residential parent-infant program participated in a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV diagnosis and questionnaires assessing ASA symptoms, adult attachment and childhood parenting experiences. Nurses recorded infant behavior using 24-hour charts. Results The prevalence of ASAD in this sample was 19.3% and women with ASAD were, on average, more likely to be diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders, report aversive parenting experiences during childhood and show adult attachment style insecurity. Both ASAD and ASA symptoms were predicted by adult attachment anxiety, and ASAD was associated with unsettled infant behavior. Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance mediated relations between parental over-control and ASAD diagnosis, and between parental abuse and ASAD diagnosis. Attachment anxiety mediated the relation between parental over-control and ASA symptoms, and attachment avoidance mediated the relations of parental over-control and parental abuse with ASA symptoms. Conclusions This study highlights the prevalence of ASAD among first time mothers experiencing early parenting difficulties and the roles of childhood parenting experiences and adult attachment style in the development of the disorder. This points to the importance of introducing universal screening for ASAD in postnatal settings, and for the development of targeted interventions. ¬© 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.","Kohlhoff, J. and Barnett, B. and Eapen, V.",0,829
1040,Development and validation of the Karitane Family Outcomes Tool,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to develop the Karitane Family Outcomes Tool (KFOT), a brief parent-report questionnaire to measure outcomes of Australian Early Parenting Centres (EPCs) and similar programmes worldwide. Design and Methods: The study was conducted in two stages. In Stage One, an initial item pool (80 items) was developed via focus group discussions with clinical experts and parents. In Stage Two, three samples of parents were recruited (online community sample: n = 849, clinical sample 1: n = 141, clinical sample 2: n = 109). The online community sample completed the 80-items and then non-normally distributed items were culled, leaving a total item pool of 57 items. The online community sample was then split into two subsamples (subsample 1: n = 650, subsample 2: n = 199). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was then conducted on online community subsample 1 and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on online community subsample 2 and clinical sample 1. Using clinical sample 2, concurrent validity was assessed by examining correlations between KFOT factor scores with scores on the Parenting Stress Index. Finally, discriminant validity was assessed by examining the KFOTs sensitivity to change following EPC intervention and by comparing KFOT scores of clinical and community samples. Results: EFA revealed 13 items loading onto three factors: ‚ÄúParental feelings,‚Äù ‚ÄúReading cues & meeting the child's needs‚Äù and ‚ÄúPerceptions of child behaviour.‚Äù The factor structure was confirmed using CFA in both the community and clinical samples. Significant differences on all three KFOT factors and on the total score were found between the clinical and community samples, suggesting that the scale is able to discriminate between clinical and nonclinical groups. Significant differences were also found between pre- and postintervention scores, and between pre- and follow-up scores, on all three KFOT factors, providing further indication of discriminant validity. The KFOT factors correlated in the expected direction with scores on the Parenting Stress Index, showing concurrent validity. Practical Implications: Results indicate that the KFOT is a brief, valid and reliable parent-report scale that can be used by nurses to evaluate outcomes of EPC and similar parenting programmes. ¬© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Kohlhoff, J. and Lee, S. and Cibralic, S. and Jones, P. and Khajehei, M.",0,830
1041,Cry analysis in infants with Rh haemolytic disease,"The influence of hyperbilirubinaemia on the infants' cries and the feasibility of the use of cry analysis for the early identification of developing kernicterus were studied by analyzing the cries of 100 healthy one-day-old infants and 31 infants with Rh haemolytic disease of the newborn (Rh-HDN) by using sound spectrographic methods. The newborn infants with Rh-HDN were divided into three subgroups according to the findings in a neurological examination: an evident group (10 infants), a transient group (13 infants) and an asymptomatic group (8 infants) and followed up until one year of age. Cry recording and a neurological examination were carried out once for each of the healthy one-day-old infants and twice a day during the first week of life for the infants with Rh-HDN, and thereafter once a day until discharged and at the ages of 1 and 3 months. Additional neurological examinations were performed on the Rh-HDN infants at the ages of 6 and 12 months. Bilirubin determination was carried out in connection with the cry recordings during the first week of life. The effect of blood exchange transfusion on the cry sound was investigated in infants with a bilirubin level above 250 mumol/l (n = 12) and below this level (n = 15) before the procedure. An electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded once during the neonatal period and once during the follow-up. The cries of the healthy infants were used to develop a cry score comprising 16 characteristics (latency, duration of phonation, maximum and minimum pitch of fundamental frequency, occurrence and maximum pitch of shift, glide, melody form, biphonation, furcation, noise concentration, voice quality, double harmonic break, glottal plosives, vibrato and glottal roll), which was then applied to the analysis of the cries of the 31 infants with Rh-HDN. In addition, maximum pitch of fundamental frequency, furcation and combination of biphonation and/or furcation were studied. The cry score and maximum pitch of fundamental frequency increased most obviously in the infants in the evident group as compared with the values after birth in the various subgroups and with the values of the healthy one-day-old infants or the infants in the asymptomatic group day by day. Both parameters also increased in the asymptomatic group between days 2 and 3 as compared with the initial value after birth and with the healthy infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","Koivisto, M.",0,831

1044,Differences in parental feeding styles and practices and toddler eating behaviour across complementary feeding methods: Managing expectations through consideration of effect size,"Nutritional experiences during infancy and toddlerhood influence the development of healthy eating habits later in life. Interest into solid food introduction practices has experienced resurgence due to the popularization of the baby-led weaning (BLW) approach as an alternative to more traditional parent-led weaning (PLW) practices. Although the literature shows beneficial effects of BLW on eating behaviours, the magnitude of those effects is unknown making parental expectation management challenging. This study provides an estimation of the size of the difference between the solid feeding practices groups for a variety of practices consistent with the development of healthy food preferences and behaviours. 565 participants with infants between 12 and 36 months old completed a survey concerning their preferred parental feeding styles, parental feeding practices, sources of information on feeding and toddler's eating behaviour. Participants were categorised to one of four groups reflecting the level of infant self-feeding level a month after the introduction of solid food (Strict PLW, Predominant PLW, Predominant BLW and Strict BLW). Estimated effect sizes of the observed significant differences showed that the magnitude of effects was modest to minimal. Moderate effect sizes were observed in comparisons regarding breastfeeding duration, maternal feeding practices, sources of information and types of first food given to the infants at the beginning of solid feeding introduction. When it comes to toddlers‚Äô eating behaviour and the family food environment, although some differences were statistically significant, the effect sizes were very small. Considering the long-lasting impact of food preferences developed at this stage along with the stress surrounding infant feeding decisions, it is crucial that the complementary feeding advice parents receive reflects realistic expectations of the outcomes regarding the effects on eating behaviour. ¬© 2019","Komninou, S. and Halford, J.

Methods: The sample consisted of 216 mother-infant dyads (49% boys) participating in an ongoing longitudinal study. Mother-infant interactions during a feeding episode and a free-play task were measured at child age 1 and 7 months, respectively.

1049,The Relations Between Maternal Prenatal Anxiety or Stress and Child‚Äôs Early Negative Reactivity or Self-Regulation: A Systematic Review,"In the present review, we examine the association between maternal prenatal stress or anxiety and children‚Äôs early negative reactivity or self-regulation. The review includes 32 studies that focus on pregnancy-related anxiety, state or trait anxiety, perceived stress, and stressful life events in relation to child‚Äôs crying, temperament, or behavior during the first 2 years of life. We searched four electronic databases and 32 studies were selected based on the inclusion criteria. Twenty-three studies found an association between maternal prenatal anxiety or stress and a child‚Äôs negative reactivity or self-regulation, and typically the effect sizes varied from low to moderate. The association was found regardless of the form of prenatal stress or anxiety and the trimester in which the prenatal stress or anxiety was measured. In conclusion, several forms of prenatal anxiety and stress may increase the risk of emotional and self-regulatory difficulties during the first 2 years of life. ¬© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Korja, R. and Nolvi, S. and Grant, K.

1050,Intestinal microbiota development and gestational age in preterm neonates,"The intestinal microbiota is an important contributor to the health of preterm infants, and may be destabilized by a number of environmental factors and treatment modalities. How to promote the development of a healthy microbiota in preterm infants is largely unknown. We collected fecal samples from 45 breastfed preterm very low birth weight (birth weight < 1500 g) infants from birth until 60 days postnatal age to characterize the intestinal microbiota development during the first weeks of life in preterm infants. Fecal microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The main driver of microbiota development was gestational age","Korpela, K. and Blakstad, E. W. and Moltu, S.

1051,Microbiome of the first stool after birth and infantile colic,"Background: Recent studies have shown a diverse microbiome in the first stool after birth. The clinical significance of the microbiome of the first stool is not known. Infantile colic has earlier been associated with the composition of the intestinal microbiome. Methods: We set out to test whether the microbiome of the first stool is associated with subsequent infantile colic in a prospective, population-based cohort study of 212 consecutive newborn infants. We used next-generation sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Results: The newborns who later developed infantile colic (n = 19) had a lower relative abundance of the genus Lactobacillus and the phylum Firmicutes in the first stool than those who remained healthy (n = 139). By using all microbiome data, random forest algorithm classified newborn with subsequent colic and those who remained healthy with area under the curve of 0.66 (SD 0.03) as compared to that of shuffled samples (P value <0.001). Conclusions: In this prospective, population-based study, the microbiome of the first-pass meconium was associated with subsequent infantile colic. Our results suggest that the pathogenesis of infantile colic is closely related to the intestinal microbiome at birth. ¬© 2020, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.","Korpela, K. and Renko, M. and Paalanne, N. and V√§nni, P. and Salo, J. and Tejesvi, M. and Koivusaari, P. and Pokka, T. and Kaukola, T. and Pirttil√§, A.

1052,The symptoms and clinical course of acute bullous myringitis in children less than two years of age,"OBJECTIVE: the most characteristic symptom of acute bullous myringitis (inflammation of the tympanic membrane) is a sudden onset of severe ear pain. However, in infants and young children a precise symptom history is more difficult to obtain and the symptoms may be less specific. Our objective was to determine the occurrence of different symptoms, signs and the recovery of symptoms during the course of acute bullous myringitis in children less than 2 years. We also evaluated whether there were any specific features in bullous myringitis in comparison with acute otitis media (AOM). METHODS: 2028 children (aged 7-24 months) at primary care level in a prospective longitudinal cohort study in the Finnish Otitis Media Vaccine Trial. RESULTS: during the follow-up there were 86 office visits with bullous myringitis in 92 ears and 1876 office visits with acute otitis media in 2683 ears. Middle ear fluid developed in 97% of cases of bullous myringitis during the course of disease. Earache was present in 58% and fever (>or=38 degrees C) in 62% of cases of bullous myringitis. The symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (rhinitis in 93% and cough in 73% of events) were present in a majority of cases. Earache, fever, rubbing of the ear, restless sleeping, excessive crying and poor appetite were present more often in bullous myringitis than in acute otitis media. The symptoms were relieved in 1-2 days in a majority of cases. There were no recognized cases of bullous myringitis in ears with patent tympanostomy tubes. CONCLUSIONS: acute bullous myringitis in children represents a special form of AOM with more severe symptoms. Earache and fever were more common in bullous myringitis than in AOM. However, the condition resolved rapidly and the short-term outcome was good.","Kotikoski, M. J. and Palmu, A. A. and Puhakka, H. J.",0,838
1053,Two-generational trauma-informed assessment improves documentation and service referral frequency in a child protection program,"Background: Two-generational trauma-informed assessment (TIA) helps providers conduct holistic family well-being assessment (FWbA). This tool makes it possible to use families‚Äô trauma history in the case-finding process. Objective: This study compares the documentation and frequency of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and service referral rates for index children and their caretakers in two groups of families evaluated in a child abuse clinic (CAC). Participants and setting: The sample consisted of 364 children stratified into two groups: Group 1 - children seen in the CAC after implementation of FWbA in years 2014, 2015, 2016 and Group 2 - children seen in the CAC prior to implementation of FWbA in years 2011, 2012, 2013. Methods: Researchers utilized retrospective chart review method and analyzed data regarding ACEs and service referrals for patients and their caregivers. Results: Documentation of ACEs was higher in Group 1 for children (77.7 % vs 26.6 %,p < 0.0001) and caretakers (60.7 % vs 7.3 % p < 0.0001). Caretakers in Group 1 had a higher rate of four or more ACEs (47.0 % vs 5.1 % p < 0.001) while the increase for children was not statistically significant (61.4 % vs 51.1 %, p = 0.110). Both children and caretakers were referred to more services in Group 1 (2.7 + 1.5 vs 1.5 + 1.3, and 3.0 + 1.9 vs 1.2 + 1.2, respectively, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: In families evaluated for child abuse and neglect, conducting TIA in addition to conventional psychosocial evaluation increased documentation regarding trauma history, which led to increased referral rates. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Kottenstette, S. and Segal, R. and Roeder, V. and Rochford, H. and Schnieders, E. and Bayman, L. and McKissic, D.

1054,How are social-emotional and behavioral competences and problems at age 1 year associated with infant motor development? A general population study,"Based on limitations in previous research evidence, we concluded that more research is needed for deeper understanding of how social-emotional and behavioral (SEB) outcomes among infant-toddler-aged children in the general population are associated with early motor development. In this study, we investigated associations between early competencies and problems, as measured by the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA), and the timing of achievement of the main gross and fine motor milestones usually attained during the first year of life in a general population context. The study sample consisted of 515 infants (mean age 12.9 [SD 0.9] months) and their parents (514 mothers, 434 fathers), who were recruited in child health centers in Northern Finland. The infants were divided into two groups, based on their BITSEA screen status, and motor milestone achievement ages were compared across BITSEA screen status No Concern and Of-Concern infants. An Of-Concern screen status on the maternal and paternal Competence scale and Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) item cluster was associated with later infant achievement ages for gross motor milestones. By contrast, infants who were screened to be in the Of-Concern range on the maternal Problem scale achieved gross motor milestones earlier than infants with the corresponding No Concern screen status. No significant associations were found between the paternal Problem scale screen status and infant motor development. In further analyses, the strongest associations were found between an Of-Concern screen status on the paternal Competence scale and ASD item cluster and infant motor development. The findings indicate that the inclusion of infant motor developmental information may assist early identification and the clinical interpretation of parental reports of early SEB problems. Clinical implications of the current findings are discussed in the paper. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Kovaniemi, S. and Alakortes, J. and Carter, A. S. and Yliherva, A. and Bloigu, R. and Joskitt, L.

1055,"Pain in infants who are younger than 2 months during suprapubic aspiration and transurethral bladder catheterization: a randomized, controlled study","OBJECTIVE: Proper diagnosis of urinary tract infections depends on obtaining an uncontaminated urine sample for culture. Suprapubic aspiration and transurethral catheterization are the 2 recommended procedures for obtaining specimens for urine culture from young infants. The objective of the current study was to compare the pain that is experienced during these 2 procedures when performed in young infants. METHODS: A prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled study was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital in Israel. Institutional Research Ethics Board approved the study. Infants who were 0 to 2 months of age and presented to the emergency department with fever and therefore required urine collection for culture were randomly assigned evenly into 2 sample collection groups: suprapubic aspiration or transurethral catheterization. Patients were excluded when they were born prematurely or had had a previous sepsis workup or other painful procedures or an anomaly of the urogenital system or abdominal wall. Eutectic mixture of local anesthetic cream that contained lidocaine and prilocaine was applied 1 hour before the procedure. The urethra was catheterized using a 5-Fr latex-free feeding tube that was lubricated with sterile water-soluble jelly that contained 2% lidocaine hydrochloride. Pediatric residents who were experienced with the procedures performed both suprapubic aspiration and transurethral catheterization. The parents were instructed to use any comfort strategies that they wished, including verbal or physical comforting and pacifiers. Pain during collection was assessed on a 100-mm visual analog scale by a nurse and a parent. In addition, the infant's upper part of the body was videotaped during the procedure. An investigator, who was blinded to the procedure, assigned a point score according to the Douleur Aigue du Nouveaune neonatal acute pain scale. For ensuring a successful blinding process, the following steps were taken. First, camera recording started 30 seconds before the procedure to prevent the possibility of distinguishing between the procedures on the basis of their duration. Second, the physician and the nurse were asked not to speak during the procedure to avoid revealing the nature of the procedure. Third, the person who videotaped the procedure watched the tape before it was analyzed to ensure the impossibility of identifying the procedure from the tape. The Student's t test was used to compare the groups. The primary outcome was the mean Douleur Aigue du Nouveaune score. Secondary outcomes were the mean visual analogue scale for pain as estimated by the parents and by the nurse. We estimated that 25 patients would be needed in each group to detect a difference in the mean Douleur Aigue du Nouveaune score of at least 2 points with a power of 80% and alpha of .05. RESULTS: The study was conducted between April 1, 2004, and April 30, 2005.

1057,Defecation patterns in infants: a prospective cohort study,"INTRODUCTION: Data regarding prevalence and natural history of infant dyschezia, defined by the Rome III criteria as straining and crying for at least 10‚ÄÖmin before successful passage of soft stools, are lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate prevalence and natural history of infant dyschezia. STUDY DESIGN: In 2003, 124 youth healthcare doctors participated in a national study on defecation patterns of infants. Using standardised questionnaires and bowel diaries, these were recorded of infants aged 1, 3 and 9‚ÄÖmonths old. RESULTS: Out of 1292 infants, 46.4% had no gastrointestinal complaints. At 1 and 3‚ÄÖmonths old, 3.9% and 0.9% infants, respectively, fulfilled the Rome III criteria for infant dyschezia. However, at the same time points, parents of 17.3% and 6.5% of infants, respectively, reported symptoms preceding defecation while not strictly fulfilling the Rome III criteria ('modified Rome III criteria'). Dyschezia-like symptoms (Rome III criteria) were also reported in 0.9% of 9-month-old infants, with 5.7% having symptoms (modified Rome III criteria). Only 3/61 (4.9%) Rome III dyschezia infants and 1/306 (0.3%) infants with modified Rome III criteria at 1 or 3‚ÄÖmonths had symptoms fitting the diagnosis of infant functional constipation at 9‚ÄÖmonths old. CONCLUSIONS: The present definition of infant dyschezia seems too strict. We propose to widen the definition in terms of symptoms as well as age in order to better fit the appreciation of the parents. The prevalence of infant dyschezia declines with age. There seems to be no relation to the development of functional constipation.","Kramer, E. A. and den Hertog-Kuijl, J. H. and van den Broek, L. M. and van Leengoed, E. and Bulk, A.

1058,"Pacifier use, early weaning, and cry/fuss behavior: A randomized control trial","Assessed whether advice to avoid pacifier use reduces the risk of early weaning (before age 3 mo) and increases the frequency or duration of crying and fussing. The authors also wished to assess the bias that occurs in using an observational vs an experimental design to study the effect of pacifier use on breastfeeding duration. 127 healthy, breastfeeding women (mean age 31.6 yrs) and their healthy, term singleton infants and 131 similar mother and infant controls (mothers' mean age 31.5 yrs) completed the double-blind study. Women in the experimental group were advised to avoid pacifier use and to use other modes of calming their crying or fussing infant. Infant behavior logs detailed the frequency and duration of crying, fussing, and pacifier use at 4, 6, and 9 wks. The authors found a strong observational association between pacifier use and early weaning. No such association was observed, however, when the data were analyzed by randomized allocation. Results suggest that pacifier use is a marker of breastfeeding difficulties or reduced motivation to breastfeed, rather than a true cause of early weaning.

We followed up 13 889 6.5-year-old Belarusian children who participated in a large cluster-randomised trial of a breast-feeding promotion intervention. Behaviour was evaluated using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), completed independently by the children's parents and teachers. We compared the results of experimental (intention-to-treat, ITT) and observational analyses (based on feeding actually received), both adjusted for clustering. Observational analyses were additionally adjusted for geographical region, urban vs. rural residence, child's sex, age at follow-up, birthweight, and maternal and paternal education. No differences between the randomised experimental vs. control groups were observed in ITT analyses. In contrast, small but statistically significant associations with weaning prior to 3 months were observed for parent and teacher SDQ scores on total difficulties, conduct problems and hyperactivity, even after multivariable adjustment. The absence of associations based on ITT analyses, in contrast with the significant associations based on observed breast-feeding duration, strongly suggests that the latter are biased by residual confounding. ¬© 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Kramer, M.

The purpose of this study was to investigate how breastfeeding technique and pacifier use were related to breastfeeding problems and duration of breastfeeding. Methods: Data were collected from the intervention group of a randomized trial in which health visitors followed up with mothers for 6 months after childbirth. The health visitors classified the breastfeeding technique at approximately 1 week after birth and repeated the observation if a correction was necessary. Effective technique included positioning, latch, sucking, and milk transfer. Data on breastfeeding problems and pacifier use were obtained from self-reported questionnaires. The study population included 570 mother-baby pairs with complete information on breastfeeding technique and pacifier use. The primary outcome was duration of exclusive breastfeeding. Results: One-half of the mothers showed ineffective breastfeeding technique at the first\ observation, most frequently ineffective position (61%) and latch (52%). In the unadjusted analysis, only sucking and milk transfer were associated with breastfeeding duration. In the adjusted analysis, ineffective technique was significantly associated with mothers reporting early breastfeeding problems, which thereby influenced the breastfeeding duration. Pacifier use had an independent negative impact on duration of breastfeeding. A single correction of the breastfeeding technique was not associated with duration or occurrence of problems. Conclusions: Observation of breastfeeding technique may help mothers in the stage of when they are establishing breastfeeding to avoid early and later problems, but breastfeeding technique is less useful in predicting breastfeeding duration. Use of a pacifier should be avoided in the first weeks after birth. ¬© 2009, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Kronborg, H. and V√¶th, M.",0,851

We compared immunogenicity and reactogenicity of two tetravalent vaccines in Indian children, who after neonatal HB immunization, were vaccinated thrice with one of these vaccines. METHODS: In this open-label randomized study, 287 infants received a dose of an Indian- (Q-Vac (TM )) or European-made (Tritanrix-HB (TM )) tetravalent vaccine at age 6, 10, and 14 weeks. The ELISA antibodies were measured prior to the first and one month after the third dose. Immunogenicity was determined by measuring the seroprotection/seropositivity rates and geometric mean titres (GMT), whereas vaccine reactogenicity was elucidated with diary cards for 7 days following each dose. The potential unsolicited events were queried throughout the whole 3-month study period. RESULTS: Out of the 250 subjects who completed the study, 123 received the Indian and 127 the European vaccine. After 3 doses, the seroprotection/seropositivity rates were 99 % and 100% for diphtheria, 98% and 95% for tetanus, 89% and 94% for pertussis, and 100% and 100% for hepatitis B, respectively. GMT of tetanus antibodies was significantly higher with the Indian vaccine. Low-grade reactogenicity was rather similar in the two vaccine groups, the most common events being local pain, redness, swelling, fever, irritability, unusual crying, drowsiness, and non-specific gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Since both immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the two vaccines were almost identical, the Indian vaccine poses a good alternative to the costlier competitor vaccines.","Kulkarni, P.

1072,Weakened Resilience in Parenting Self-Efficacy in Pregnant Women Who Were Abused in Childhood: An Experimental Test,"This study tested experimentally whether the combination of a history of childhood abuse and confrontation with difficult infant temperament is associated with negative changes in parenting self-efficacy. First-time pregnant women (N = 243) participated in the Adult Attachment Interview, which was used to assess the occurrence of abuse by parents in childhood and unresolved representations, and completed a task asking them to respond to infant cries. Sixty of the 243 participants (25%) experienced childhood abuse, mostly physical or sexual. The task simulated infant temperamental difficulty by manipulating soothing success in order to reflect an easy-to-soothe (80% soothing success) and a difficult-to-soothe infant (20% soothing success). Both after baseline and after each of the two stimulus series women assessed their parenting self-efficacy. Women who reported childhood abuse did not differ from women who reported no childhood abuse in parenting self-efficacy at baseline or in response to the easy-to-soothe infant (relative to baseline), but decreased more in parenting self-efficacy following the difficult-to-soothe infant. Effects did not vary according to resolution of trauma. These findings suggest that in response to infant temperamental difficulty, women who experienced childhood abuse may more easily lose confidence in their parenting abilities, which underlines the importance of preparing at-risk women for the possible challenges that come along with parenthood.","Kunseler, F.

1073,"Crying babies, tired mothers: What do we know? A systematic review","Objective: to synthesise the evidence on the interconnectedness of infant crying and maternal tiredness in the postpartum period, both from quantitative as well as from qualitative studies. Methods: a systematic review was conducted including studies in English, French and German published from 1980 to 2007. Studies were included in the systematic review if they had extractable data on infant crying as well as maternal tiredness in the period of 0-3 months post partum. Of 100 retrieved publications, 10 met these criteria. Findings: evidence from this review indicated that the amount of infant crying during the first three months postpartum is associated with the experience of tiredness and fatigue in new mothers. Significant associations were found in five of six quantitative studies. The four identified qualitative studies describe how infant crying disrupts new mothers' circadian rhythms, reducing opportunities to rest and exacerbating tiredness. Incremental exhaustion diminished parents' ability to concentrate, raising the fear of harming their children, triggering depressive symptoms and burdening parent-child interaction. Key conclusions and implications for practice: if healthcare professionals are to address the prominent concerns of parents caring for a neonate, it is essential to review current care practices and tailor them to maternal and infant needs. A care strategy alleviating the burden of infant crying and maternal fatigue has the potential to strengthen family health from the earliest stage. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.","Kurth, E. and Kennedy, H.

1074,Responding to a crying infant - You do not learn it overnight: A phenomenological study,"Objective: to examine the views and practices of first-time and experienced mothers in response to infant crying during the first 12 weeks post birth. Design: longitudinal, qualitative study using an interpretive, phenomenological approach. Setting: postnatal hospital and home settings in Switzerland. Participants: maximum variation sampling of 15 new mothers of diverse parity and educational background who had given birth to a full-term healthy neonate. Methods: participant observations in the postnatal ward and two narrative interviews at participants' homes at 6-8 and 12-14 weeks post partum. Data analysis used interpretive approaches of case analysis, thematic analysis and exemplars. Findings: first-time mothers showed some soothing skills from the beginning, but fine-tuned their practices of handling the crying infant and managing their own reactions. With growing experience mothers acquired a differentiated understanding of the crying's reason and urgency and used more successful soothing techniques. At the same time they learned to assess and mitigate their own stress reactions by self-soothing and adopting realistic expectations of normal infant behaviour. Experienced mothers knew the infant's frequent crying would diminish after a while whereas first-time mothers coped without this positive expectation. Key conclusions: with increasing child-care experience mothers' skills and attitudes towards crying changed, leading to a calmer and less escalating response to their crying infant. Implications for practice: inexperienced mothers need information on neonatal crying behaviour and on parents' stress response. They should be taught how to recognise and respond to the new-born's signals, and how to cope with their own stress. Postnatal care should provide novice mothers to learn from experienced role models. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Kurth, E. and Kennedy, H.

1075,Predictors of Crying Problems in the Early Postpartum Period,"Objective: To investigate maternal and infant factors associated with midwife-reported crying problems in the early postpartum period. Design: Case control study. Setting: Postnatal home care in Switzerland. Participants: Seven thousand seven hundred and sixty-five mother/child dyads who received postnatal homecare by midwives (n=1,636 cases of midwife-reported crying problems, n=6,129 controls). Methods: We investigated factors associated with infant crying problems during the postpartum period as documented in the Statistical Database of Independent Midwives' Services in Switzerland (2007). Using case control methodology, we matched all identified cases of crying problems with controls who had been cared for by the same midwife. A conditional logistic regression model was used to analyze the associations of reported crying problems with maternal and infant factors. Results: Maternal health and mood problems in the immediate postpartum period were significantly associated with reported crying problems. Maternal health and mood problems included physical complications after birth, psychological decompensation, and depression. Further risk factors for infant crying problems were planned resumption of paid work directly after paid maternity leave (at 15-16 weeks postpartum) and immigrant status. A protective effect was observed for higher parity. Conclusions: Crying problems in the early postpartum period are associated with mothers' physical, psychological, and social conditions. Care practices that promote new mothers' physical and psychological recovery after birth could be a promising strategy to prevent early crying problems. Specific support is important for mothers with early signs of depression or decompensation, intention to return early to paid work, immigrant background, and for first-time mothers. ¬© 2010 AWHONN, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses.","Kurth, E. and Spichiger, E. and Cignacco, E. and Kennedy, H.

1076,"Crying babies, tired mothers - challenges of the postnatal hospital stay: An interpretive phenomenological study","Background: According to an old Swiss proverb, ""a new mother lazing in childbed is a blessing to her family"". Today mothers rarely enjoy restful days after birth, but enter directly into the challenge of combining baby- and self-care. They often face a combination of infant crying and personal tiredness. Yet, routine postnatal care often lacks effective strategies to alleviate these challenges which can adversely affect family health. We explored how new mothers experience and handle postnatal infant crying and their own tiredness in the context of changing hospital care practices in Switzerland.Methods: Purposeful sampling was used to enroll 15 mothers of diverse parity and educational backgrounds, all of who had given birth to a full term healthy neonate. Using interpretive phenomenology, we analyzed interview and participant observation data collected during the postnatal hospital stay and at 6 and 12 weeks post birth. This paper reports on the postnatal hospital experience.Results: Women's personal beliefs about beneficial childcare practices shaped how they cared for their newborn's and their own needs during the early postnatal period in the hospital. These beliefs ranged from an infant-centered approach focused on the infant's development of a basic sense of trust to an approach that balanced the infants' demands with the mother's personal needs. Getting adequate rest was particularly difficult for mothers striving to provide infant-centered care for an unsettled neonate. These mothers suffered from sleep deprivation and severe tiredness unless they were able to leave the baby with health professionals for several hours during the night.Conclusion: New mothers often need permission to attend to their own needs, as well as practical support with childcare to recover from birth especially when neonates are fussy. To strengthen family health from the earliest stage, postnatal care should establish conditions which enable new mothers to balance the care of their infant with their own needs. ¬© 2010 Kurth et al","Kurth, E. and Spichiger, E. and Zemp Stutz, E. and Biedermann, J. and H√∂sli, I. and Kennedy, H.

1078,Ask the Question: Screening for Postpartum Mood and Anxiety Disorders in Pediatric Primary Care,"Postpartum mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) are a significant source of toxic stress for young children and can disrupt developing brain architecture resulting in long-lasting deleterious effects. Thus, screening for PMADs must be considered as an essential task of a pediatric primary care provider (PCP) and the pediatric medical home. Problems in parenting capacity in mothers with PMADs can lead to disorders in attachment and a range of other emotional and developmental challenges for a young child. Therefore, all PCP office visits with mothers should include surveillance as well as formal screening at regular, pre-determined intervals. During surveillance, identification of psychosocial, maternal, infant, and maternal/infant risk factors is critical. There are a number of well researched, standardized, reliable, free and valid screening tools including the Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-2 and PHQ-9) and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EDPS). Office implementation includes availability of educational materials, resource information, and referrals so families can get appropriate treatment. Screening for PMADs is highly effective and helps to identify a common, underdiagnosed disorder in parents that without identification and appropriate treatment can lead to significant negative outcomes for a young child. ¬© 2017 Mosby, Inc.","Kurtz, S. and Levine, J. and Safyer, M.",0,862

The study participants consisted of 69 healthy low birth-weight infants who were admitted to the NICU at the Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan. This study analyzed the relationship between NBAS scores measured neonatal behavioral performance and crying at term age. This study results indicate that there was significant statistical negative correlation between the amount of total daily crying and Habituation, Range of state, Regulation of state, and Autonomic stability cluster scores and some individual items scores (Response decrement to light, Response decrement to tactile of foot, Alert responsiveness, Examiner persistence, Motor maturity, Irritability, General irritability, Cuddliness, Consolability, Self-quieting activity, and State regulation). The high levels crying group also showed higher responsivity than less crying group in the items of Peak of excitement, Rapidity of build-up, Irritability and General irritability. In conclusion, neonatal behavioral characteristics such as poor inhibit discrete stimuli while asleep, hyper-responsivity and poor state regulation abilities were risk factors of high levels of crying.","Kusaka, R. and Ohgi, S. and Shigemori, K. and Fujimoto, T.",0,863
1080,Effect of early intervention using state modulation and cue reading on mother-infant interactions in preterm infants and their mothers in Japan,"This study examined the effects of early intervention on mothers and their preterm infants. Intervention aimed to facilitate mother-infant interaction by enhancing the mother's ability to modulate her infant's state and to read infant cues. Specifically, the intervention consisted of a nurse researcher visiting the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) before each infant was discharged, and conducting post-discharge home visits until the infant reached a corrected age of 60 weeks. For research design purposes, mother-infant dyads were placed into either (1) an Intensive Intervention Group (‚Ö°G) or (2) a Mild Intervention Group (MIG). The outcomes of the groups were then compared. The effects of early intervention were rated by examining mother-infant interaction and the durations of infant sleep and crying. Despite individual differences, there were more improved interaction scores at Time 1 in ‚Ö°G members that had recorded lower interaction scores earlier than those of MIG. A lower frequency of night crying was also recorded from the ‚Ö°G. The results implied that interventions teaching state-modulation methods and cue reading to the mothers should be started while their infants are in the NICU.","Kusanagi, M. and Hirose, T. and Mikuni, K. and Okamitsu, M.",0,864
1081,Parental supply and offspring demand amongst Karo Batak mothers and children,"The resolution of parent-offspring conflict (POC) might sway in favour of the offspring if the parent relies on offspring-supplied information about need. Here, three hypotheses from a resolution model of POC were tested using data on sickness histories and mother-infant interactions from 24 Karo Batak women and their young children from two rural villages in North Sumatra, Indonesia. First, as predicted, offspring with greater need (measured as age and propensity to illness) tended to fuss more often. Second, as expected, observed fussiness predicted the number of suckling occurrences observed during sampling periods. Third, contrary to the prediction, the duration of fussing observed after breast-feeding occurrences was longer than the duration of the breast-feeding occurrences themselves. Parental decisions were made based on offspring-supplied information about need, but offspring failed to garner resources in excess of the parental optimum. This suggests that a POC interpretation is unnecessary to account for these results. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)","Kushnick, Geoff",0,865

1084,A training program on exclusive breastfeeding in maternity wards,"Objectives: To estimate whether a 3-day training program for health professionals was followed by changes in maternity ward practices and in the rate of exclusive breastfeeding. Methods: A retrospective study in the maternity ward of a French university hospital involved two cross-sectional samples of 323 mother-infant pairs in 1997 and 324 in 2000. Results: The rate of exclusive breastfeeding at discharge increased from 15.8% (12.0-20.2) in the before sample to 35.2% (30.0-40.6) in the after sample (P<0.01). This result persisted in the multivariable analysis [adjusted odds ratio, 2.74 (1.72-4.37)]. Infants in the before sample were less likely to be breastfed within 1 h of birth (9.2% vs. 16.9%, P=0.01), to room-in 24 h/day (56.6% vs. 72.6%, P<0.01), and were more likely to receive formula supplementation (77.6% vs. 54.0%, P<0.01). Conclusions: A training program for health professionals can be effective in improving maternity ward practices and increasing exclusive breastfeeding rate at discharge. ¬© 2003 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

1085,Assessment of infant cry: acoustic cry analysis and parental perception,"Infant crying signals distress to potential caretakers who can alleviate the aversive conditions that gave rise to the cry. The cry signal results from coordination among several brain regions that control respiration and vocal cord vibration from which the cry sounds are produced. Previous work has shown a relationship between acoustic characteristics of the cry and diagnoses related to neurological damage, SIDS, prematurity, medical conditions, and substance exposure during pregnancy. Thus, assessment of infant cry provides a window into the neurological and medical status of the infant. Assessment of infant cry is brief and noninvasive and requires recording equipment and a standardized stimulus to elicit a pain cry. The typical protocol involves 30 seconds of crying from a single application of the stimulus. The recorded cry is submitted to an automated computer analysis system that digitizes the cry and either presents a digital spectrogram of the cry or calculates measures of cry characteristics. The most common interpretation of cry measures is based on deviations from typical cry characteristics. Another approach evaluates the pattern across cry characteristics suggesting arousal or under-arousal or difficult temperament. Infants with abnormal cries should be referred for a full neurological evaluation. The second function of crying--to elicit caretaking--involves parent perception of the infant's needs. Typically, parents are sensitive to deviations in cry characteristics, but their perception can be altered by factors in themselves (e.g., depression) or in the context (e.g., culture). The potential for cry assessment is largely untapped. Infant crying and parental response is the first language of the new dyadic relationship. Deviations in the signal and/or misunderstanding the message can compromise infant care, parental effectiveness, and undermine the budding relationship. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

1087,The long-term health-related quality of life in children treated for burns as infants 5-9 years earlier,"The long-term outcome after infant burn was queried 5-9 years after the initial accident. All participants had been treated for burn in Children's Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, before the age of 1 year. We hypothesized that the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in young burn survivors may be impaired compared to healthy age matched peers. The health-related quality of life of 126 infant burned patients with a mean total body surface area (TBSA) of 3.5% was queried with the standardized and validated 17D questionnaire. The HRQoL of the respondents was compared to that of a representative sample of the general age-standardized population. A total of 44 (35%) children with a mean age of 7 years responded, and 64% of them were male. The median time from trauma was 6.3 years. Burn related features, age at burn time, burn size and site, and the treatment given were similar in the respondents group and all children approached. The mean HRQoL score of the respondents was better than that of the control population (p < 0.05). Comparison of the 17D profiles of the patients having been treated as inpatients or outpatients showed that those treated on an outpatient basis had better scores on the dimensions of speech, breathing, and friends (p < 0.05). The 17D profiles of patients with scalds or contact burns were similar. The perceived and expressed long-term HRQoL in the burned children was good, and on some dimensions (sleeping, learning, discomfort and symptoms, breathing, depression, and appearance) even better, than that of the control population. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

1092,The lived experience of growing,"Growth is a fundamental biological process of life. For more than a century, scientific ideas about how growth occurs put it into the category of background noise to daily life: an invisible aspect of getting bigger day-by-day that occurs unless a child becomes ill and can not grow. Careful measurement of individuals, however, documents that growth is not a backdrop, but a discrete time-specific event. These events impinge on individual well-being, alter sensory perceptions and influence behavior. Understanding fluctuations in behavior, particularly among infants, is challenging at best, limited by their developing communicative skills. Parents try to get into the head of their small children and understand the subjective experiences that drive their sometimes erratic behavior: the child who seemed perfectly content yesterday is suddenly a distraught individual for whom no action can make things right. Measurement has identified the existence of specific biological sources for such inexplicable outbursts: the child is growing. The subjective experience of growing is one of hunger, sleep changes, agitation and irritation. It looks like a child with a behavior problem, prompting parents to become concerned that their child needs to be disciplined. The objective reality of a growth spurt is a time of biological variation characterized by fluctuations in hormones and the chemistry of tissue alterations. Knowing that a child is growing brings concordance between behavior and biology and is empowering to both parents and children in coping with a fundamental experience in life.

1093,Duration of breastfeeding and serum PCB 153 concentrations in children,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are toxic, persistent, and bioaccumulative chemicals which, because of their lipophilic properties, are abundant in human breast milk. Breastfed infants are therefore at risk of being exposed to considerable amounts of PCBs. The commonly used exposure estimations, based solely on breast milk PCB levels and duration of breastfeeding, may lead to exposure misclassification. To improve assessments of exposure to PCBs, we determined PCB 153 serum concentration, as a model substance for PCBs, at the critical time of weaning for each child in 305 breastfed infants from 5 single time point concentration measurements spread over 7 years and data on duration of breastfeeding, using an earlier developed model of the system type. We approximated the dependence of PCB 153 serum concentration, Ctbf, adjusted to cord serum concentration, C0, on nursing period, by a polynomial function Ctbf/C0=0.596+0.278t-0.0047t2 which reliably predicts exposure to PCB 153 of breastfed infants, important for assessment of dose-outcome relationships. Adjustment of current serum concentrations to cord serum concentration improved validity of exposure assessment. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Lancz, K. and Hertz-Picciotto, I. and Jusko, T.

1094,Parents' experience of living with a baby with infantile colic--a phenomenological hermeneutic study,"BACKGROUND: About 10% of newborn babies have infantile colic which means that they cry more than 3 hours per day. The baby's crying risks disturbing the early parent-child interaction. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to illuminate the meaning of being a parent of a baby with infantile colic. DESIGN: An inductive qualitative interview study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: Twenty-three parents (12 mothers and 11 fathers) seeking help for infantile colic at a Child Health Clinic in south Sweden, having verified in a diary their babies' crying to more than 3 hours/day, were individually interviewed between March 2006 and April 2007. Parents were selected to ensure variation in age and gender and if they were first-time parents. METHOD: Parent's narratives were analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic method. FINDINGS: The main theme found was 'Colic overshadows everything'. Tired and worried parents experienced living in an inferno. Both fathers and mothers suffered with their babies, felt powerless and overwhelmed by strong feelings and neglected their other needs. To get through this period, parents used various strategies to ease their baby's pain. Parents forced themselves not to lose control, to keep a stiff upper lip and generally to bear up. Sharing the burden was important. In spite of the suffering, they also felt hope, happiness and gratitude that they had a healthy baby. The results were reflected upon in relation to systems theory, attachment theory and a theory of interpersonal aspects of nursing. CONCLUSION: It is an important task for professionals to empower parents and help them to endure the colic period and to gain higher self-esteem as parents. By listening to the parents' stories they can better understand their situation, offer support and increase self-efficacy.","Landgren, K. and Hallstr√∂m, I.",0,875

At four study visits at the Child Health Center parents meet a nurse for 20-30 min to receive advice and support. The nurse and the parents are blinded for group allocation. Infants are carried to another room, where they spend five minutes with an acupuncturist. Infants randomized to group A receive standardized minimal acupuncture in LI4. Group B receive individualized acupuncture where, according to symptoms, the acupuncturist can choose between the points Sifeng, LI4, and ST36. Group C receives no acupuncture. The primary outcome is relative difference in crying, counted in minutes. Secondary outcomes are number of infants fulfilling the criteria for colic, and changes in sleep and stooling frequency. Adverse events and blinding are recorded. Recruitment started in January 2013. During the first 14 months 93 patients were included. Data collection continues until May 2015. No interim analyses have been conducted. Discussion: The study will provide information about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture as a complement to usual care in infants with colic.

1099,The impact of maternal childhood abuse on parenting and infant temperament,"The impact of maternal history of maltreatment and psychopathology on mother-child relationship, parenting, and infant temperament was evaluated. Women completed self-report measures addressing childhood trauma, psychopathology, infant-parent relationship, parenting, and infant temperament. Maternal physical abuse was associated with poorer mother-child interactions, increased vigilance, and difficulty recovering from distress among infants, whereas a history of emotional abuse was linked with less interactional dysfunction, lower levels of infant frustration, and more pleasure. Maternal depression was associated with infant temperament and attitudes about parenting. These findings suggest that maternal history of childhood abuse and psychopathology are important determinants of parenting and infant temperament. ¬© 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Lang, A.

1100,Maternal feeding practices during the first year and their impact on infants' acceptance of complementary food,"The introduction of weaning foods is a major transition in the development of infants' eating behavior. Previous studies showed that greater variety at the beginning of the weaning period can later influence an infant's acceptance of new foods. The aim of the present study was to describe maternal feeding practices in the first year (breastfeeding duration, age at the initiation of weaning, variety of new foods introduced) and to study whether they impacted infants' later acceptance of new foods in a longitudinal survey of French children's eating behavior.Mothers (n= 203) were asked to record each food offered to their infants from the beginning of the weaning period to the age of 15. months and to score the acceptance of each food for the first 4 presentations. The foods were clustered into categories (i.e. fruits, vegetables...). The link between individual characteristics (maternal age, education level, parity, caregiver during weaning and infant gender) and exclusive breastfeeding duration, age at the initiation of weaning, age at the introduction of each food category, number of new foods introduced from all categories and the infant's acceptance of each food was studied. Finally, the link between feeding practices and infants' acceptance of new foods was analyzed.Seventy-two percent of the infants were exclusively breastfed from birth for a median duration of 68. days. On average, the age at the initiation of weaning, 5. months, was in accordance with the current French recommendations. The number of new foods introduced was 13.4 per month on average and differed from one infant to another with no association with individual characteristics. The reactions to new foods were positive in 90% of the cases but differed according to food categories. In the early weaning period, fruits and vegetables were the least positively accepted foods","Lange, C. and Visalli, M. and Jacob, S. and Chabanet, C. and Schlich, P. and Nicklaus, S.",0,881
1102,Emotional reactivity at 12 months in very preterm infants born at <29 weeks of gestation,"The present study evaluated the socio-emotional development of very preterm born infants at 12 months corrected age. Forty-one infants born very preterm (<29 weeks of gestation) were compared to 22 infants born full term on a standardized behavioral assessment and a parental temperament questionnaire, both measuring emotional reactivity to joy, anger and fear, as well as sustained attention.The behavioral assessment showed that very preterm infants exhibited as much joy as full term infants during a joy-eliciting episode. However, they expressed a significantly higher reactivity in anger-eliciting situations and a reduced reactivity toward fear-eliciting situations. For all three emotion-eliciting situations, the preterm infants reacted with a higher level of motor activity. The preterm infants also exhibited a distinct attention pattern with a significantly higher initial attention level which declined rapidly throughout the episode. The questionnaire did not show any group differences.The clinical relevance of these results in terms of preliminary hallmarks of later behavioral difficulties such attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder are discussed as well as the inconsistencies observed between the questionnaire and the behavioral assessment. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Langerock, N. and van Hanswijck de Jonge, L. and Bickle Graz, M. and H√ºppi, P.

Because of changes in vaccine use by provinces over time and movement of families across jurisdictions, it is possible that children are exposed to different combination vaccines during the primary infant immunization schedule. The safety and immunogenicity of mixed primary infant schedules is unknown. METHODS: In a double-blind multicenter trial, 2-month-old healthy infants were randomized to 1 of 2 schedules at 2, 4, and 6 months of age (either Pediacel, Pediacel, Infanrix [PPI] or Infanrix, Pediacel, Pediacel [IPP]).

1104,The effects of maternal stress and illness during pregnancy on infant temperament: Project Ice Storm,"BACKGROUND: To determine whether disaster-related prenatal maternal stress and maternal illness during pregnancy predict maternal-rated temperament status in 6-mo-old infants. METHOD: The temperamental status of 121 infants (60 boys and 61 girls) exposed in utero to varying degrees of maternal stress and/or illness during either first (n = 40), second (n = 43), or third (n = 38) trimester of pregnancy was assessed using the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire. RESULTS: Higher levels of maternal subjective distress and illness were primarily independently associated with poorer temperamental status in the infants. Maternal subjective distress explained 3.4, 3.1, and 9.8% and early pregnancy illness explained 4.3, 5.8, and 2.9% of the variance of the infants' fussy/difficult, dullness, and needs attention temperament dimensions, respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to assess whether temperament status is influenced by disaster-related prenatal maternal stress. Moreover, this is the first study to assess whether maternal stress and illness during pregnancy interact to determine infant temperament status. The findings suggest that while both factors predict temperament status at 6 mo, they do so primarily in an independent manner. These results suggest that pathways through which maternal stress and illness during pregnancy influence temperament status differ.","Laplante, D. P. and Brunet, A. and King, S.",0,884
1105,Associations between sleep consolidation in infancy and peer relationships in middle childhood,"Sleep plays an important role in many aspects of children's development. Research on children's sleep and their peer relationships has begun to emerge in the last years. However, these studies are mostly cross-sectional. The current study aimed to investigate the associations between infant sleep and peer relationships in middle childhood. The sample comprised 72 children. Sleep was measured at 1 year using a sleep diary completed by mothers. In the second and third grades of elementary school (7 and 8 years of age), mothers and fathers reported on their children's functioning with peers. When they were in third grade, children were interviewed regarding their friendship quality with a best friend. Results revealed negative associations between children's sleep consolidation (i.e., ratio of nighttime sleep) and parent-reported peer problems, and positive associations between sleep consolidation and perceived friendship quality. These findings suggest that well-regulated sleep in infancy may help children develop the skills necessary for later appropriate social functioning in peer contexts. ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Larose-Gr√©goire, √â and Bernier, A. and Dirks, M. and Perrier, R.",0,885
1106,Cognitive ability at kindergarten entry and socioeconomic status,"OBJECTIVE: To examine how gradients in socioeconomic status (SES) impact US children's reading and math ability at kindergarten entry and determine the contributions of family background, health, home learning, parenting, and early education factors to those gradients. METHODS: Analysis of 6600 children with cognitive assessments at kindergarten entry from the US Early Childhood Longitudinal Birth Cohort Study. A composite SES measure based on parent's occupation, education, and income was divided into quintiles. Wald F tests assessed bivariate associations between SES and child's cognitive ability and candidate explanatory variables. A decomposition methodology examined mediators of early cognitive gradients. RESULTS: Average reading percentile rankings increased from 34 to 67 across SES quintiles and math from 33 to 70. Children in lower SES quintiles had younger mothers, less frequent parent reading, less home computer use (27%-84%), and fewer books at home (26-114). Parent's supportive interactions, expectations for their child to earn a college degree (57%-96%), and child's preschool attendance (64%-89%) increased across quintiles. Candidate explanatory factors explained just over half the gradients, with family background factors explaining 8% to 13%, health factors 4% to 6%, home learning environment 18%, parenting style/beliefs 14% to 15%, and early education 6% to 7% of the gaps between the lowest versus highest quintiles in reading and math. CONCLUSIONS: Steep social gradients in cognitive outcomes at kindergarten are due to many factors. Findings suggest policies targeting levels of socioeconomic inequality and a range of early childhood interventions are needed to address these disparities.

1107,Alleviation of the pain of venepuncture in neonates,"A recent study has shown venepuncture to be more effective and less painful than heel-lancing when a single blood test is performed in neonates [Larsson, Pediatrics (in press)]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the value of EMLA applied on the dorsum of the hand when sampling blood in neonates. METHODS: This was a controlled randomized and double-blinded study. One hundred and twenty neonates were randomly allocated to two groups, EMLA or placebo. Five hundred milligrams (0.5 ml) of EMLA or placebo was placed on the dorsum of the hand, covered with an occlusive dressing, and left in place for 60 minutes. For venepuncture, a needle measuring 0.9 x 40 mm was used. The two groups were also compared as regards the total time needed to complete the PKU test and the number of skin punctures required. The facial reaction was videotaped and later analysed by two blinded observers using the Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS). RESULTS: No side effects occurred, except for a temporary blanching or redness of the skin, which disappeared within minutes. Nociceptive response: After skin puncture, the NFCS scores were significantly lower in the EMLA group than in the placebo group (median 287 and 374, respectively). After the first skin puncture, a cry was recorded in 35/55 cases (64%) in the EMLA group and in 38/56 cases (68%) in the placebo group, this difference was not significant. The duration of the first cry was significantly shorter in the EMLA than in the placebo group (median 12 and 31 s, respectively). CONCLUSION: In comparison with a placebo, EMLA significantly reduces the pain caused by venepuncture on the dorsum of the hand and does not complicate puncture of the vein.","Larsson, B.

1108,Venipuncture is more effective and less painful than heel lancing for blood tests in neonates,"OBJECTIVE: Heel lancing has hitherto been the method of choice for screening tests of inborn errors of metabolism in neonates. Eutectic mixture of local anesthetic has little, if any, analgesic effect when applied to the heel of pre- and full-term infants. Today there seems to be no practical method that effectively alleviates the pain caused by heel lancing. The aim of this study was to investigate whether other methods, such as venipuncture of the dorsal side of the hand, are less painful and more efficient than heel lancing in neonates. METHODS: One hundred twenty healthy, full-term infants who underwent testing for phenylketonuria (PKU) were included in the study. They were randomized into three groups: a venipuncture group (VP) (n = 50), a heel-lance group with a small lancet (SL) (n = 50), or a large lancet (LL) (n = 20). Pain reactions were assessed by the Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS). The latency and duration of the first cry as well as the total screaming time was analyzed. The efficacy of the method was assessed by the time taken to complete the PKU test and number of times the skin had to be punctured. RESULTS: Nociceptive response. The NFCS scores after the first skin puncture were: VP, 247","Larsson, B. A. and Tannfeldt, G. and Lagercrantz, H. and Olsson, G. L.",0,888
1110,Neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN): A useful marker of neuronal immaturity in sudden unexplained perinatal death,"Introduction In the developing brain neuronal differentiation is associated with permanent exit from the mitotic cycle. Neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) is a nuclear protein widely expressed in the mature postmitotic neurons. Methods We applied NeuN immunocytochemistry in 65 cases of perinatal death (16 victims of sudden intrauterine unexplained death syndrome/SIUDS, 19 of sudden infant death syndrome/SIDS and 30 controls) to test the physiological status of the brain neurons. In addition we applied both TUNEL and Caspase 3 immunohistochemical methods in order to highlight a possible relation between decreased NeuN expression and apoptotic outcome. We also attempted to see whether or not NeuN pathological changes can be related to cigarette smoke absorption in pregnancy. Results NeuN staining was considerably reduced or lost in SIUDS/SIDS compared to controls. However neurons with decreased NeuN-labeling showed no sign of apoptosis. A significant association was found between NeuN depletion and maternal smoking. Conclusion Altered NeuN expression can be a marker of immature and/or suffering neurons. The exclusive presence of this pattern of expression in SIUDS/SIDS victims, leads us to recommend the NeuN immunohistochemistry as a routine method in neuropathological protocols to convalidate a diagnosis of sudden perinatal death. ¬© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

1111,Sleep SAAF: A responsive parenting intervention to prevent excessive weight gain and obesity among African American infants,"Background: Responsive parenting interventions that shape parenting behaviors in the areas of sleep and soothing, appropriate and responsive feeding, and routines represent a promising approach to early obesity prevention and have demonstrated effectiveness in our previous trials. However, this approach has yet to be applied to the populations most at-risk for the development of early obesity, including African Americans. The Sleep SAAF (Strong African American Families) study is a two-arm randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating whether a responsive parenting intervention focused on promoting infant sleeping and self-soothing can prevent rapid weight gain during the first 16 weeks postpartum among first-born African American infants. The responsive parenting intervention is compared to a child safety control intervention. Methods: Three hundred first-time African American mothers and their full-term infants will be enrolled from one mother/baby nursery. Following initial screening and consent in the hospital, mothers and infants are visited at home by Community Research Associates for data collection visits at 1 week, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks postpartum and for intervention visits at 3 weeks and 8 weeks postpartum.

1114,Differential compliance instrument in the treatment of infantile colic: a report of two cases,"OBJECTIVE: To report on the novel use of a computer-assisted adjusting device as a potentially safe method for treatment of infantile colic. CLINICAL FEATURES: Two infants were diagnosed by their pediatrician as having infantile colic, which was characterized by signs of distress, uncontrollable crying, and brief episodes of screaming. Both children had normal growth (despite low birth weight in the second) and no other abnormalities. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: A PulStar Function Recording and Analysis System (PulStar FRAS, Sense Technology, Inc, Pittsburgh, Penn) device was used to administer light impulses (approximately 1.7 joules, which produced a 3 to 4 lb force) at each segmental level throughout the dorsal spine, with probe tips spaced 2 cm apart straddling the spinous processes. Crying was reduced by 50% after a single session of instrumental adjusting in a 6-week old girl and after 4 sessions in a 9-week old boy, according to colic diaries kept by the mothers. Average hours of uninterrupted daily sleep increased from 3.5 to 6.5 hours after a single session. Within 10 days (5 and 8 sessions, respectively), colicky behavior disappeared and average total daily sleep improved to 14.5 hours (an average increase of 4.5 hours). Results continued over a 30-day follow-up. CONCLUSION: The PulStar mechanical adjusting device appears to have been well tolerated and beneficial in 2 cases of infantile colic. Further research is necessary to determine whether this device can enhance the safety and effectiveness of chiropractic treatment in infants with colic.","Leach, R. A.",0,893
1115,Effects of Cycled Lighting Versus Continuous Near Darkness on Physiological Stability and Motor Activity Level in Preterm Infants,"Background: Preterm infants generally spend weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit where light intensity can fluctuate as well as be high, leading to physiological instability and increased motor activity in these infants. To date, 2 lighting control methods have been studied: Cycled lighting and continuous near darkness. The most appropriate method of lighting is still unknown due to ambivalent results from the studies that have assessed these 2 interventions. Objective: To compare the effects of cycled lighting versus continuous near darkness on physiological stability and motor activity level in preterm infants born between 28 and 32 weeks of gestation. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted to compare physiological stability and motor activity level in preterm infants assigned to cycled lighting or continuous near darkness. Thirty-eight participants were recruited and randomly assigned to one of the lighting conditions for 24 hours. Physiological stability was measured using the Stability of the Cardiorespiratory System in Premature Infants (SCRIP) score, the means, and the coefficient of variation of each physiological parameter measured. The level of motor activity was measured with an accelerometer. Results: There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with regard to physiological stability measured by the SCRIP score, means, and coefficient of variation as well as motor activity level. Participants in both groups were physiologically stable and their motor activity level was comparable. Implications for Practice and Research: Neither cycled lighting nor continuous near darkness negatively impacted infant's physiologic stability and motor activity level. Further research is required to identify the most appropriate lighting control method for preterm infants born between 28 and 32 weeks of gestation. ¬© 2017 National Association of Neonatal Nurses.","Lebel, V. and Aita, M. and Johnston, C. and He√≥n, M. and Dupuis, F.",0,894

The clinical characteristics of newborns with hyperthermia remained in the nursery were compared with those transferred to the SC nursery. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the appropriate cutoff BT for predicting further septic workup in the SC nursery.Among the 92 newborns with hyperthermia evaluated, 30 (32.6%) were transferred to the SC nursery and 62 (67.4%) remained in the nursery. Clinical characteristics associated with transfer to the SC nursery included the highest BT, BT at first measurement during hyperthermia, frequency of hyperthermia, duration of hyperthermia, irritable crying, decreased appetite, poor activity, vomiting with abdominal distension, tachypnea, and tachycardia (all P‚Ää<‚Ää.05). BT for predicting the need for transferring newborns with hyperthermia to the SC nursery had an area under the curve of 0.976 (P‚Ää<‚Ää.001).

The First-Year Inventory 2.0 is a parent-report screening instrument designed to identify 12-month-old infants at risk for an eventual diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and consists of two domains: Social-Communication and Sensory-Regulatory. Although the First-Year Inventory 2.0‚Äôs screening psychometrics have been examined, its construct validity has not been investigated. In a sample of 112 high-risk 12-month-olds, we examined the First-Year Inventory 2.0‚Äôs associations with the Autism Observation Scale for Infants, an observer-based Autism Spectrum Disorder screener, and with other developmental instruments measuring similar areas in social communication and regulatory functioning in young children. Findings generally supported the First-Year Inventory 2.0 associations with other instruments in expected ways. The First-Year Inventory 2.0 Social-Communication domain was notably associated with the Autism Observation Scale for Infant‚Äôs total score and with language and communication domains of the Vineland and the Mullen. The Sensory-Regulatory domain showed minimal associations with other instruments that only had a few sensory items. Considering different objectives and strengths of assessments, researchers and clinicians are encouraged to utilize a variety of instruments in a comprehensive evaluation of a child. Lay abstract: The First-Year Inventory 2.0 is a parent-report screening instrument designed to identify 12-month-old infants at risk for an eventual diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. This instrument focuses on Social-Communication and Sensory-Regulatory areas of infant behavior. Although the First-Year Inventory 2.0 screening performance has been previously studied, its validity has not been examined. Establishing validity of an instrument is important because it supports the effectiveness and the reliability of the instrument. In this study, we examined relationship between the First-Year Inventory 2.0 (Social-Communication and Sensory-Regulatory areas) and other instruments that measure similar areas of infant behavior in a sample of high-risk infant siblings of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. These other instruments share some common aims and theoretical areas with the First-Year Inventory 2.0: the Autism Observation Scale for Infants, the Mullen Scales of Early Learning, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II, and the Infant Behavior Questionnaire. Findings generally supported the validity of the First-Year Inventory 2.0 with other instruments. In particular, the Social-Communication area of the First-Year Inventory 2.0 showed greater commonality with other instruments than in the Sensory-Regulatory area. The Sensory-Regulatory area seemed to be a unique feature of the First-Year Inventory 2.0 instrument. Considering different aims and strengths of assessments, researchers and clinicians are encouraged to utilize a variety of instruments in a comprehensive evaluation of a child. ¬© The Author(s) 2020.","Lee, H.

In a study of 160 Korean infants (aged 1‚Äì6 mo), average time spent sleeping decreased and total daily maternal periods of contact increased, with age. The number of time periods where the infant was alone was significant, but the decrease of crying was not. There was no definite clustering of crying during the evening hours. Compared with Western studies, the duration of crying of Korean infants was shorter and the time of holding and close contact with mothers longer, and colic was not found in this study.

Ninety-five institutional infants and 143 home infants, aged 2-18 weeks were studied through diaries, recorded by children's care-givers or mothers. Results showed that the crying duration of the infants in institutions was almost double that of infants at home (86 vs45 min/day) and contact period with the care-givers was half that of home infants (136 vs 279 min/day). In addition, the duration of periods when the babies were alone was much longer in the institution group (1089 vs 1002 min/day). There was a tendency for both groups of institution and home infants to cry more during the evening (from 18.00 to 24.00 h) but there was no definite peak of crying at any age except the slight increase of crying after 12 weeks for the institution group. When compared with research on Western infants, the daily crying durations of both institution and home infants fall short of those of their Western counterparts.

1123,Efficacy and safety of adjunctive levetiracetam therapy in pediatric intractable epilepsy,"To investigate the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam adjunctive therapy in childhood intractable epilepsy, data were reviewed for 130 children who had >or=4 seizures per month, whose seizures were intractable to an initial >or=2 antiepileptic drugs, and who could be monitored for at least 6 months after levetiracetam add-on. Reduction in seizure frequency and related variables were investigated. Sixty-two of the 130 patients (48%) showed a seizure reduction of >or=50%, and 28 patients (22%) became seizure-free. A reduction in seizures by >or=50% was observed in 33/64 in children with partial seizures (52%) and in 29/66 children with generalized seizures (44%). Efficacy did not differ significantly among seizure types. Overall efficacy was unaffected by abnormalities evident from magnetic resonance imaging, by mental retardation, or by maintenance dose of levetiracetam. The mean maintenance dose of levetiracetam was 47.0mg/kg per day (S.D. = +/- 29.7), and mean follow-up duration was 13.4 months (S.D. =+/- 8.7). No demographic features differed significantly between patients with seizure freedom and without seizure remission. Levetiracetam was discontinued in 24 children at last visit (retention rate, 82%). The most common complaint was irritability (5%), and none of the adverse events were life threatening. In conclusion, levetiracetam adjunctive therapy is effective and safe for childhood intractable epilepsy.","Lee, Y. J. and Kang, H. C. and Kim, H. D. and Lee, J. S.",0,901

Results: Sixty-eight briefings were carried out. Parents and nurses evaluated the briefings in a favorable manner, whereas physicians' ratings were mixed. Practice Implications: Further inquiry is recommended to understand the effects of a structured communication intervention on parent-professional decision-making practices. ¬© 2014, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Legrow, K. and Hodnett, E. and Stremler, R. and Cohen, E.",0,903
1135,Gallbladder hypocontractility in infantile colic,"We evaluated gallbladder contractility in 58 colicky infants and 57 age-matched controls. Gallbladder size was measured before and 1 h after feeding and the contraction index of the gallbladder was calculated. The results showed decreased contractility of the gallbladder in colicky infants: mean contraction index in colicky infants was 56% (95% confidence interval, 49-63%) and in controls 67% (61-73%). No difference was found in the fasting size of the gallbladder. Postprandial contraction was decreased in colicky infants examined in the evening (n = 14) compared with those examined in the morning (n = 44). Decreased contraction of the gallbladder was found in those colicky infants who presented colicky cry compared with colicky infants without symptoms at the time of examination. No structural abnormalities were found in the general abdominal survey. In conclusion, infants with colic have hypocontractility of the gallbladder. This indicates abnormal biliary tract physiology in association with infantile colic.","Lehtonen, L. and Svedstr√∂m, E. and Korvenranta, H.",0,904
1138,Early development in children that are later diagnosed with disorders of attention and activity: a longitudinal study in the Danish National Birth Cohort,"Not much is known about the early development in children that are later diagnosed with disorders of attention and activity (ADHD). Using prospective information collected from mothers in the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), we investigated if developmental deviations in the first years of life are associated with later ADHD. In the DNBC 76,286 mothers were interviewed about their child's development and behaviour at age 6 and 18¬†months. At the end of follow-up, when the children were 8-14¬†years of age, 2034 were registered in Danish health registers with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD. The Hazard Ratio of ADHD was estimated using Cox regression model. At 6¬†months of age deviations in development showed associations with the child later being diagnosed with ADHD such as duration of breastfeeding, motor functioning, and incessant crying. At 18¬†months, many observations clearly associated with ADHD as for example the child not being able to fetch things on request [HR 3.0 (95¬†% CI 2.4","Lemcke, S. and Parner, E.

1139,"Infant irritability: The impact of fetal alcohol exposure, maternal depressive symptoms, and low emotional support from the husband","Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of fetal alcohol exposure, maternal depressive symptoms, and low emotional support from the husband on infant irritability in the first one and a half years of life. Four models describing the interplay of these factors were assessed: A direct effect model, an interaction or threshold model, a mediational model and a transactional model. Method: A sample of initially 458 women was assessed in a prospective 3-wave study across the first 17 months after childbirth. Fetal alcohol exposure was questioned retrospectively six weeks after birth. Infant irritability was reported by the mothers and fathers. Results: Support for the direct effect model and the interaction model could be found: Fetal alcohol exposure and low emotional support from the husband were associated with increased infant irritability at 5 months. The impact of fetal alcohol exposure was moderated by postnatal depressive symptoms. More irritability was reported if both risk factors, prenatal alcohol exposure and maternal depressive symptoms, were present. Infant irritability and maternal depressive symptoms were associated cross-sectionally. At the age of 17 months only a main effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on irritability could be found. Conclusion: Direct effects of fetal alcohol exposure, maternal depressive symptoms, and low emotional support from the husband on infant irritability as well as an interaction between fetal alcohol exposure and maternal depressive symptoms were revealed. The interaction can be understood in terms of a diathesis-stress model. However, no longitudinal associations between maternal depressive symptoms and infant irritability could be found. ¬© 2009 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.","Lemola, S. and Stadlmayr, W. and Grob, A.",0,906
1140,"How effective is tetracaine 4% gel, before a peripherally inserted central catheter, in reducing procedural pain in infants: a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial [ISRCTN75884221]","BACKGROUND: Procedural pain relief is sub-optimal in infants, especially small and vulnerable ones. Tetracaine gel 4% (Ametop, Smith-Nephew) provides pain relief in children and larger infants, but its efficacy in smaller infants and for peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) remains uncertain. The objective of this trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of tetracaine gel on the pain response of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants during insertion of a PICC. METHODS: Medically stable infants greater than or equal to 24 weeks gestation, requiring a non-urgent PICC, were included. Following randomization and double blinding, 1.1 g of tetracaine or placebo was applied to the skin for 30 minutes. The PICC was inserted according to a standard protocol. Pain was assessed using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP). A 3-point change in the pain score was considered clinically significant, leading to a sample size of 54 infants, with 90% statistical power. Local skin reactions and immediate adverse cardiorespiratory events were noted. The primary outcome, PIPP score at 1 minute, was analysed using an independent Student's t-test. RESULTS: Fifty-four infants were included, 27 +/- 2 weeks gestation, 916 +/- 292 grams and 6.5 +/- 3.2 days of age. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The mean PIPP score in the first minute was 10.88 in the treatment group as compared to 11.74 in the placebo group (difference 0.86, 95% CI -1.86, 3.58). Median duration of crying in non-intubated infants was 181 seconds in the tetracaine group compared to 68 seconds in the placebo group (difference -78, 95% CI -539, 117). Local skin erythema was observed transiently in 4 infants (3 in the treatment and 1 in the placebo group). No serious harms were observed. CONCLUSION: Tetracaine 4% when applied for 30 minutes was not beneficial in decreasing procedural pain associated with a PICC in very small infants.","Lemyre, B. and Sherlock, R. and Hogan, D. and Gaboury, I. and Blanchard, C. and Moher, D.",0,907
1141,"Associations Between Preterm Birth, Low Birth Weight, andPostpartum Health in a Predominantly Hispanic WICPopulation","Objective: To describe the postpartum health of predominantly Hispanic participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and identify how health characteristics differ between mothers who delivered preterm or low birth weight infants and those who did not. Design: Cross-sectional survey among postpartum WIC mothers. Setting: Los Angeles and Orange Counties, CA. Participants: WIC participants within 1year of delivery (n=1,420). Main Outcome Measures: Postpartum health behaviors, health characteristics, and birth spacing intentions and behaviors. Analysis: Frequencies of health characteristics were estimated using analyses with sample weights. Differences were assessed with chi-square and Fisher exact tests with Bonferroni correction for pairs of tests. Results: Many women exhibited postpartum risk factors for future adverse health events, including overweight or obesity (62.3%), depressive symptoms (27.5%), and no folic acid supplementation (65.5%). Most characteristics did not differ significantly (. P>.025) between mothers of preterm infants and full-term infants or between mothers of low birth weight and normal birth weight infants. Conclusions and Implications: Despite few differences between postpartum characteristics of mothers who delivered preterm or low birth weight infants and those who did not, a high percentage of mothers had risk factors that need to be addressed. Current postpartum educational activities of WIC programs should be evaluated and shared. ¬© 2014 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior.","Leonard, S. A. and Gee, D. and Zhu, Y. and Crespi, C.

1142,In sync with the family: Children and partners influence the sleep-wake circadian rhythm and social habits of women,"Different factors have been proposed to influence morningness-eveningness, biological rhythms, and sleep-wake cycles, but few studies focused on the influence of social habits. Here, we focus on the influence of children and partners on the social habits of women at different stages of their lives and on synchronization within the family. One hundred and seventy-nine women participated in the study and were allocated into four groups: women without children, pregnant women without children, pregnant women with children, and non-pregnant mothers. Morningness was predicted by the presence of children, and earlier chronotype was predicted by the presence of children, pregnancy, and age. Average sleep duration was longest in pregnant women. The presence of children was responsible for a difference in rise times of approximately 1.5h on the weekend. Subjective sleep-onset latencies were shortest in women with children. The synchrony between partners (husband/wife) was 0.46 in women without children, 0.79 in pregnant women, 0.40 in women with children, and 0.56 between mother and child. Partners' chronotypes were highly correlated, as were those of mother and child. This study suggests children have a strong influence on their mother's lifestyle and sleep-wake rhythm, far beyond the first months of life, and that children are a more important social factor than the male partner.","Leonhard, C. and Randler, C.",0,909
1143,Maternal Intrapartum Antibiotic Administration and Infantile Colic: Is there a Connection?,"Background: The aetiology of infantile colic remains unknown. However, altered gut microbiota composition has been reported in children with the disorder. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the associations between perinatal factors potentially affecting gut colonization and infantile colic. Methods: Altogether 48 infants with colic and 29 controls were selected from 2 ongoing clinical studies. Infants with and without colic were comparable with regard to their background characteristics. Results: A significant difference was detected in intrapartum antibiotic use and breastfeeding rates between infants with and without colic. The association between exposure to intrapartum antibiotics and infantile colic remained statistically significant after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Conclusions: Since intrapartum antibiotic exposure may have an effect on early gut colonization, our finding is consistent with the association between aberrant early gut microbiota composition and development of colic. Antibiotic-exposed neonates may represent a novel target group for preventive intervention studies. ¬© 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

1146,Breastfeeding mothers consume more vegetables and a greater variety of fruits and vegetables than non-breastfeeding peers: The influence of socioeconomic position,"Aim: This study compared the diets of breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding mothers from socioeconomically diverse regions of Melbourne to determine whether breastfeeding is a marker for healthier maternal dietary intakes. Methods: This cross-sectional study obtained information via self-reported questionnaire from 529 first-time Melbourne mothers. Breastfeeding status was determined when the children were 3.9months. Diet information was obtained using a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire. Maternal diet was assessed by seven indicators: average daily intake of fruit, vegetables, non-core drinks, non-core sweet snacks, non-core savoury snacks, variety of fruit and variety of vegetables eaten in the preceding 12months. Associations between breastfeeding status and each dietary variable were assessed using linear regression analyses. Socioeconomic position, maternal body mass index and the cluster-based sampling design were controlled for. Results: Of the 529 subjects, 70% were breastfeeding their child. Compared with non-breastfeeding mothers, breastfeeding mothers were found to consume more serves of vegetables (P= 0.001), a greater variety of fruit and vegetables (P= 0.001 and P‚â§ 0.001 respectively), and sweet snacks were consumed more frequently (P= 0.006). Differences were observed between low and high socioeconomic position mothers for fruit serves (P= 0.003), vegetable serves (P= 0.010) and fruit variety (P= 0.006). These associations persisted after controlling for socioeconomic position and maternal body mass index. Conclusions: The association between infant feeding (breastfeeding) and some aspects of maternal diet provides further evidence suggesting a link between maternal and child diets from a younger age than previously examined. ¬© 2012 The Authors.

1147,Developmental outcome prediction from acoustic cry analysis in term and preterm infants,"It has been suggested that the cry may reflect the neurophysiologic integrity of the infant and relate to later developmental outcome. In this study, the cry was recorded at term conceptional age in 18 preterm and 13 term infants using a standardized procedure and analyzed by high-speed computer. At 18 months of age, a significant number of infants were correctly classified as scoring high or low on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development based on the mean and variability in the fundamental frequency, variability in the first formant, and the amplitude of the cry. At 5 years of age, a significant number of infants were correctly classified on the McCarthy General Cognitive Index and on the verbal, perceptual-performance, and quantitative subscales based on the variability of the fundamental frequency, variability of the first formant, and amplitude and duration of the cry. Although preliminary, this study supports the potential use of the cry as a noninvasive measure to detect developmental outcome in the infant at risk.","Lester, B. M.",0,914
1148,Cardiorespiratory reactivity during the Brazelton Scale in term and preterm infants,"Determined the relationship between behavior measured with the Brazelton Scale and simultaneously recorded cardiorespiratory activity. The Brazelton Scale was administered and videotaped in a sample of 22 term and 22 preterm infants at term conceptional age. The videotapes were coded off line with a computer interface to time lock behavior and physiological activity for the duration of four alert, non-crying conditions. Term infants showed increases in heart rate and breathing rate when unswaddled and cuddled following cry and increases in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during orientation and swaddling. Preterm infants showed the same general trend as term infants in heart rate and breathing rate. However, RSA decreased during orientation in preterm infants. On behavioral scores, preterm infants showed lower scores on self-regulation and a higher cost of attention. Correlations between behavior and physiological activity showed lower RSA associated with enhanced behavioral scores for the preterm infants. Results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that attentional responsivity in the preterm infant may be at the expense of physiological stability.

The hypothesis was that excitable CCHs were related to the direct effects of COC, while depressed CCHs were related to the indirect effects of cocaine secondary to low birthweight. Analyses showed direct effects of COC on cries with a longer duration, higher fundamental frequency, and a higher and more variable first formant frequency. Indirect effects of cocaine secondary to low birthweight resulted in cries with a longer latency, fewer utterances, lower amplitude, and more dysphonation.

The mother switched to a commercial formula and reported a dramatic decrease in the infant's crying. The mother was asked to feed the infant breast milk from a bottle, and she agreed. The mother kept a daily diary of her infant's crying, sleeping, stooling patterns, and feeding problems. Analysis of the mother's breast milk showed concentrations of 69 ng/mL for fluoxetine and 9 ng/mL for norfluoxetine. Infant blood serum/plasma concentrations following return to breast milk were 340 ng/mL for fluoxetine and 208 ng/mL for norfluoxetine. The diary records showed increased crying, decreased sleep, increased vomiting, and watery stools when fluoxetine hydrochloride was transmitted through breast feeding or breast milk in bottle. These symptoms were reduced when the infant was formula fed.

This article presents exploratory findings on (a) the potential impact of IPV on mother-child relationships and child development and (b) the association between these maternal-child relationship impacts and child development. The fit of findings with compensatory, spillover, and compartmentalization hypotheses was explored. Participants were 49 mothers and 51 children younger than 3 years of age affected by IPV. Data were collected on maternal-child interactions, child development, social support, difficult life circumstances, family functioning, child temperament, and parental depression. The findings suggested developmental impacts on children in the sample, along with children's high sensitivity and responsiveness to their caregivers. Although some spillover effects were observed, the predominant observation was of mothers and infants compensating for exposure to IPV in their interactions. ¬© 2013 Springer Publishing Company.","Letourneau, N. and Morris, C.

1153,Neurodegenerative course in ceramidase deficiency (Farber disease) correlates with the residual lysosomal ceramide turnover in cultured living patient cells,"Farber's lipogranulomatosis is an inborn lipid storage disease characterized by tissue accumulation of ceramide due to deficient activity of lysosomal ceramidase. Symptoms include painful swelling of joints, subcutaneous nodules, a hoarse cry, hepatosplenomegaly and nervous system dysfunction of markedly variable degree. In most cases the neural dysfunction rather than the general dystrophy, seems to limit the duration of Farber disease. We examined whether the severity can be shown as a function of ceramide turnover by lysosomal ceramidase. The lysosomal degradation of sphingomyelin-derived ceramide was studied in situ in patient skin fibroblasts and lymphoid cells loaded with LDL-associated radioactive sphingomyelin. We could show for the first time a significant correlation between the ceramide accumulated in situ and the severity of Farber disease. Our method provides an alternative means for determining ceramide degradation by lysosomal ceramidase, but in intact cells. The relatively simple method is at least of the same diagnostic use for Farber disease as the in vitro assay of acid ceramidase using cell homogenates and may also have some prognostic use.","Levade, T. and Moser, H.

1158,Neonatal withdrawal syndrome: associated drugs and pharmacologic management,"Use of addicting drugs among women during pregnancy exposes newborns to potentially serious disorders. A group of symptoms referred to as neonatal withdrawal syndrome (NWS) may occur in infants born to mothers addicted to certain drugs because, at birth, the infants suddenly are cut off from the drug supply. Classes of drugs that cause NWS are those that produce addiction in adults, including the opioids (heroin, methadone, morphine), barbiturates, alcohol, and benzodiazepines. Many of the manifestations of NWS occur regardless of the class of drug, including irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and failure to gain weight. The fact that these symptoms are nonspecific makes it difficult to identify NWS unless it is specifically looked for. The onset, duration, and severity of the disorder differ based on such factors as the addictive drug used, time and amount of mother's last dose, and rate of elimination of the drug from the newborn. Pharmacologic intervention may be required to control severe symptoms and signs. The most common drugs used to modify withdrawal are phenobarbital, paregoric, chlorpromazine, and diazepam. Treatment is complicated by conflicting information on the effectiveness of various agents.","Levy, M. and Spino, M.",0,925

Mothers in both groups were found to engage more in caregiving and holding than fathers. Fathers of preterm infants, however, were more involved in caregiving and holding than were fathers of fullterm infants. Fathers in both groups surpassed mothers in playing and stimulating, but mothers and fathers of preterm infants played with and stimulated their infants more than did parents of fullterm infants. Parents of preterm infants also perceived their infants as being more difficult than did parents of fullterm infants. Infant characteristics, namely birth weight and medical complications, as well as parental education were found to be significant variables underlying parental variations within the group of preterm infants, but not the duration of the hospital stay or parental ethnic origin. ¬© 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In this retrospective study, we analyzed the predictors of successful reduction of intussusception using air enema in infants younger than 4 months. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 97 intussusception patients of younger than 4 months between January 2008 and December 2012. Demographic data, clinical presentation, and outcomes of air enemas were collected and analyzed. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses for significant predictors of successful reduction of intussusception using air enemas. RESULTS: Of the 97 infants younger than 4 months (median age 97.6 days, age range 41-119 days), 63 (65%) were boys and 34 (35%) were girls. The duration of symptoms ranged from 5 to 53 hours, with a median of 16.3 hours. The clinical features included paroxysmal crying (75%), vomiting (68%), bloody stools (61%), and palpable abdominal masses (32%). The duration of symptoms, bloody stools, and the shape of the intussusceptum were found to be significantly predictive of the outcome of air enema reduction of intussusception. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of successful reduction of intussusception using air enemas in infants younger than 4 months is low. Factors such as the duration of symptoms, bloody stools, and the shape of the intussusceptum are predictive of the outcome of air enema reduction of intussusception.","Li, J. E. and Yang, L.

1165,The Fidelity of Mutans Streptococci Transmission and Caries Status Correlate with Breast-Feeding Experience among Chinese Families,"Our previous study reported that the fidelity of mutans streptococci (MS) transmission from mother to infant was gender- and race-specific within a Birmingham, Ala., population. We hypothesized that fidelity might be a function of postnatal nurturing practices. The purpose of the present study was to investigate those factors that could be correlated with MS transmission among Chinese children whose nurturing histories were known. Forty-eight families with 2- to 3-year-old children were selected from two kindergartens of Beijing, China. A questionnaire concerning the childhood nursing practice was obtained from the parents. Dental caries status was examined, and bacterial samples were collected for all participants twice at 6-month intervals. An average of six isolates of MS was picked at random from selective medium from each individual at each visit. Chromosomal DNA fingerprints were performed for all MS isolates to determine the genomic similarity within each family and among individuals. The results showed that 66% of the children at 2-3 years of age harbored MS, and 46% were caries-active. Of those children, 70% were breast-fed. Among the children whose chromosomal DNA fingerprint genotypes of MS matched that of their mothers, 88% were breast-fed compared with only 12% who were not breast-fed (p = 0.03). We also found that children who were breast-fed for more than 9 months were likely to harbor strains of MS common to their mothers (p = 0.04) and experience more dental caries (dmft = 4.4) at 3 years of age compared with children who were breast-fed less than 9 months (dmft = 1.4, p = 0.04). The data suggest that breast-feeding, especially prolonged breast-feeding, may correlate with the fidelity of transmission and that prolonged breast-feeding may contribute to a higher caries rate.

1166,Perceptions of food intake and weight status among parents of picky eating infants and toddlers in China: A cross-sectional study,"Background Previous studies have suggested that children that are picky eaters may have a different and less varied diet than non-picky children, but the literature on picky eating in Chinese children is limited. Objectives To assess the prevalence of picky eating in 6‚Äì35 month-old Chinese children, and to explore how parents' perceptions of picky eating relate to children's intake and body composition. Methods 1414 6-35 month-old infants and toddlers from 8 Chinese cities were included in this study. Questionnaires were used to collect information on family demographic factors, child picky eating behaviors, food group rejection, and parents' perception of child weight status. Dietary intake data was collected via 24-h recall. Children's length/height and weight were measured. Results The reported prevalence of picky eating was higher in 24‚Äì35 month-olds (36% of children) compared to 6-11 month-olds (12%). There were no consistent significant differences in dietary intakes of nutrients between picky and non-picky eaters. Picky eating children whose parents indicated that they avoided eggs had lower intake of this food group compared to non-picky eaters, whereas those reported to avoid grains or meat had higher intakes of those food groups. Weight status was underestimated by parents of both picky and non-picky children. Conclusions Picky eating seems to occur at similar prevalence rates in China as has been reported in other countries. Parents' perceptions of food refusal do not reflect actual intakes, nor do nutrient intakes of picky eaters show additional gaps compared to non-picky eating children. In healthy children with typical growth patterns, picky eating seems to be a normal phase of development experienced by some children, without substantial consequences on their nutrient or food group intakes. ¬© 2016 The Author(s)","Li, Z. and van der Horst, K. and Edelson-Fries, L.

1168,Caregiving and positioning effects on preterm infant states over 24 hours in a neonatal unit in Taiwan,"In this prospective, descriptive study, we used a repeated-measures design to explore the 24-hour effects of caregiving and positioning on preterm infants' states and the factors associated with state changes. Thirty preterm infants (gestational age 27.6-36.1 weeks) were observed for 3 days in the neonatal intensive care unit to record six states: quiet sleep (QS), active sleep, transition, active awake, quiet awake, and fussy or crying. The occurrences of QS increased when infants received no caregiving, social interaction, non-nutritive sucking (NNS), and were laterally positioned. However, QS significantly decreased and fussy or crying state increased when infants received routine and intrusive caregiving. These results suggest that caregiving, NNS, and positioning should be appropriately provided to facilitate infants' sleep, and reduce fussiness or crying. ¬© 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Liaw, J.

1169,Nonnutritive sucking and oral sucrose relieve neonatal pain during intramuscular injection of hepatitis vaccine,"CONTEXT: Newborns are subject to pain during routine invasive procedures. Pain caused by immunization injections is preventable, but remains untreated in neonates. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study was to compare the effectiveness of three nonpharmacological pain relief strategies on newborns' pain, physiological parameters, and cry duration before, during, and after hepatitis B intramuscular (IM) injection. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized clinical trial, we enrolled 165 newborns (gestational age, ‚â•36 weeks). The infants received IM injections and were randomized to three treatment groups: nonnutritive sucking (NNS), 20% oral sucrose, or routine care. Pain was measured by the Neonatal Facial Coding System, physiological signals by electrocardiogram monitors, and cry duration using a stopwatch. RESULTS: Pain was significantly lower among infants in the NNS (B=-11.27, P<0.001) and sucrose (B=-11.75, P<0.001) groups than that in controls after adjusting for time effects, infant sleep/wake state, number of prior painful experiences, and baseline pain scores. Infants in the NNS and sucrose groups also had significantly lower mean heart and respiratory rates than the controls. Cry duration of infants receiving sucrose was significantly shorter than those in the NNS (Z=-3.36, P<0.001) and control groups (Z=-7.80, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: NNS and oral sucrose can provide analgesic effects and need to be given before painful procedures as brief as a one-minute IM injection. Sucrose orally administered two minutes before injection more effectively reduced newborns' pain during injection than NNS. Both nonpharmacological methods more effectively relieved newborns' pain, stabilized physiological parameters, and shortened cry duration during IM hepatitis injection than routine care.","Liaw, J.

1170,The hidden costs of infant vaccination,"Combination vaccines to minimize injections required for infant vaccination, and new vaccines with improved safety profiles, will pose increasingly complex choices for vaccine purchasers in the future. How much of a premium to pay for such vaccines might be determined by taking into account (1) the psychological burden of multiple injections during a single clinic visit, and the costs of any additional visits to minimize these, and (2) the medical, work-loss, and incidental costs of common vaccine-associated symptoms. This cross-sectional survey included randomly-selected parents of 1-8-month-old infants who received vaccines in a Northern California health maintenance organization (HMO) in 1997. Interviewers called parents 14 days after the infant's vaccination to administer a 10-minute closed-ended interview in English or Spanish. Parents were asked about infant symptoms after vaccination, their preferences regarding multiple injections and their (theoretical) willingness to pay to reduce the number of injections their infant would receive, or to avoid the adverse symptoms experienced. Among 1769 eligible infants, interviews were completed with parents of 1657 (93%). The psychological cost of multiple injections was estimated by the willingness of parents to pay a median of $25 to reduce injections from 4 to 3, $25 from 3 to 2, and $50 from 2 to 1. Vaccine-associated symptoms caused mean costs of $42 in medical utilization and $192 in work-loss among the families who experienced those events (Ns=62 and 35, respectively). When averaged among all 1657 study infants, vaccine-associated symptoms after the index vaccination visit resulted in $2.91 in medical utilization, $4.05 in work-loss, and $0.74 in direct nonmedical costs, yielding total financial costs of $7.70. Parents of infants who had vaccine-associated symptoms said they would have paid a median of $50 to avoid these symptoms. Fever and fussiness were associated in logistic regression analysis with a two-fold increase in the odds of medical utilization, and fever with more than a three-fold increase in work loss. We conclude that multiple injections during a single clinic visit entail psychological costs. The psychological costs of vaccine-associated symptoms, as measured by willingness-to-pay methods, are higher than those resulting from multiple injections. The financial costs of medical utilization and work-loss resulting from common vaccine-associated symptoms are non-negligible and should be incorporated in economic analyses.

The aim was to describe first-time mothers' feelings for their infant and partner during the first postpartum year in relation to maternal depressive symptoms. Research questions were addressed about: What is the prevalence of maternal depressive symptoms 10days postpartum? How does maternal depressive symptoms on day 10 relate to her mood and feelings for the infant and partner at days 3 and 10, and at 6 and 12months postpartum?

1173,"Intergenerational transmission of emotion dysregulation: Part I. Psychopathology, self-injury, and parasympathetic responsivity among pregnant women","The World Health Organization recently reported that maternal mental health is a major public health concern. As many as one in four women suffer from psychiatric disorders at some point during pregnancy or the first postpartum year. Furthermore, self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs) represent one of the leading causes of death among women during this time. Thus, efforts to identify women at risk for serious forms of psychopathology and especially for SITBs are of utmost importance. Despite this urgency, current single-diagnostic approaches fail to recognize a significant subset of women who are vulnerable to perinatal stress and distress. The current study was among the first to investigate emotion dysregulation-a multilevel, transdiagnostic risk factor for psychopathology-and its associations with stress, distress, and SITBs in a sample of pregnant women (26-40 weeks gestation) recruited to reflect a range of emotion dysregulation. Both self-reported emotion dysregulation and respiratory sinus arrhythmia, a biomarker of emotion dysregulation, demonstrated expected associations with measures of mental health, including depression, anxiety, borderline personality pathology, and SITBs. In addition, self-reported emotion dysregulation was associated with blunted respiratory sinus arrhythmia responsivity to an ecologically valid infant cry task. Findings add to the literature considering transdiagnostic risk during pregnancy using a multiple-levels-of-analysis approach.","Lin, B. and Kaliush, P.

1175,"Prolonged touch screen device usage is associated with emotional and behavioral problems, but not language delay, in toddlers","Background: Touch screen devices are now ubiquitous, and their usage by young children is increasing. However, the effects of these devices on young children are still unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to address the associations of touch screen device exposure with symptomatic emotional and behavioral problems and language development in children between the ages of 18 and 36 months. Method: A total of 161 primary caregivers of children between the ages of 18 and 36 months were recruited from the pediatric ward and outpatient clinic at a medical center in southern Taiwan. All caregivers were asked to fill out the Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 1¬Ω‚Äì5 (CBCL 1¬Ω‚Äì5) and a questionnaire on basic personal information and touch screen device usage, and they were also interviewed with the Communication and Language Screening Test for Birth to Three Chinese-Speaking Infant-Toddlers (CLST). Independent t-test and one-way ANOVA were used to examine the differences among the categories in the demographic variables and to characterize the touch screen device usage behaviors. Pearson's correlation was used to analyze the relationship between language delay and the extent of touch screen device exposure. After primary univariate analysis, we used multiple regression models to examine the relationships among the effects of touch screen device usage behaviors on children's emotional and behavioral problems and language development. Result: The children's mean age was 25.63 months (SD = 5.35). Children who spent more time on touch screen devices were more likely to have emotional problems (Œ≤ = .219, p < .010, 95 % CI: .279‚Äì1.518), anxious/depressive symptoms (Œ≤ = .206, p < .050, 95 % CI: .170‚Äì1.244), somatic complaints (Œ≤ = .291, p < .001, 95% CI: .455‚Äì1.462), social withdrawal symptoms (Œ≤ = .194, p < .050, 95 % CI: 0.133‚Äì1.150), attention problems (Œ≤ = .300, p < .001, 95 % CI: .432‚Äì1.267), and aggressive behaviors (Œ≤ = .247, p < .010, 95 % CI: .967‚Äì3.983). The effects were not noted on language development (Œ≤ = ‚àí.136, p < .100, 95 % CI: ‚àí2.595‚Äì.147). Conclusion: Young children who spent more time on touch screen devices were more likely to have emotional problems, anxious/depressive symptoms, somatic complaints, social withdrawal symptoms, attention problems, and aggressive behaviors, but not language delay. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Lin, H.

1176,Intussusception in a child infected with enterovirus: case report,"Most intussusceptions in childhood are idiopathic. The association of viral infection has been suspected for decades. We report a case of ileocolonic intussusception in a child during a course of enterovirus infection. A 20-month-old girl with vomiting and irritable crying of 4 days' duration was found to have intussusception by sonography. She had suffered from herpangina one week earlier. Due to her peritoneal signs, she underwent surgical manual reduction. A cluster of enlarged lymph nodes in the intussuscipiens was noted preoperatively by high resolution ultrasound. Two swollen lymph nodes were removed for pathologic evaluation and examined for a viral genome by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Panenterovirus base pairs were confirmed on the electrophoresis print. During postoperative sonographic follow-up, significant shrinkage of previous mesenteric lymphoid hyperplasia was observed. In this article, we present the first case of childhood intussusception in associated with enterovirus infection, in which the panenterovirus genome was identified in the patient's mesenteric lymph nodes. This was also the first evaluation of the role of mesenteric lymph nodes in intussusception by high resolution sonography.","Lin, S. L. and Shih, S. R. and Hung, Y. B. and Lin, C. Y. and Lu, C.

1177,Pacifier-sucking and breast-feeding: A comparison between the 1960s and the 1990s,"Purpose: Pacifiers and their forerunners have been condemned in past centuries, probably beginning in the 17th and 18th centuries when alcohol and opiates were incorporated as fillings in sucking rags in Great Britain. Nowadays, the modern pacifier is criticized for reducing breast-feeding time and encouraging weaning. The purpose of this study was to analyze if pacifier-sucking has been detrimental to breast-feeding in the past few decades. Methods: In the present study, 2 groups of young children born 30 years apart (1967 and 1995 to 1997) in the same geographic area were analyzed in the first 6 months of age regarding their sucking and feeding habits, including initial and prolonged pacifier-sucking and breast-feeding. Results: Findings do not support the commonly held opinion that pacifier-sucking reduces breast-feeding time. In the 30 years that separate the 2 groups, the pacifiersucking habit increased by 32% and prolonged use of a pacifier increased. At the same time, breast-feeding at 6 months old has increased 20-fold in the contemporary group (born between 1995 and 1997) as compared with the 1967 group. Conclusions: The results suggest that mothers might be unable to satisfy their child's sucking urge through breast-feeding alone, and that they use the pacifier as a supplement. Pacifier use does not negatively affect the prevalence of breast-feeding.","Lindsten, R. and Larsson, E.",0,938
1178,The safety and efficacy of oral dextrose for relieving pain following venepuncture in neonates,"The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of oral 30% dextrose during venepuncture in neonates. Neonates admitted in the Special Care Nursery for jaundice from September 200 to January 2001 were recruited for this double-blind randomised controlled trial. The intervention consisted of administration of either 2 ml of oral 30% dextrose or 2 ml of sterile water 2 minutes before venepuncture. The primary outcome measure was the cumulative Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) score at 3 minutes after venepuncture and the duration of cry assessed from a videotaped recording. Twenty-six neonates received 30% dextrose and 26 neonates received sterile water. The cumulative NIPS score at 3 minutes (median, IQR) after venepuncture for neonates given 30% dextrose (13, 6.8-21) was significantly (p = 0.03) lower than that for neonates given sterile water (21, 13.8-21). The duration of cry in neonates given 30% dextrose (median 45 sec IQR 1.5-180.8 sec) was significantly (p = 0.03) shorter than that in neonates given sterile water (median 191 sec IQR 52.3-250 sec). No neonates developed diarrhoea, fever or rash during the 24 hour observation period. Both the intra-rater (ICC 0.993 95% CI 0.988-0.996) and inter rater (ICC 0.988 95% CI 0.980-0.993) agreement on the 3-minute NIPS score were good. In conclusion oral 30% dextrose given 2 minutes before venepuncture was effective in reducing neonatal pain following venepuncture. It is a simple, safe and fast acting analgesic and should be considered for minor invasive procedure in term neonates.","Ling, J. M. and Quah, B. S. and Van Rostenberghe, H.",0,939
1179,Reduced crying in term infants fed high beta-palmitate formula: A double-blind randomized clinical trial,"Background: Beta-palmitate (sn-2 palmitate) mimics human milk fat, enabling easier digestion.Therefore, we hypothesized that infants consuming high beta-palmitate formula would have more frequent, softer stools and reduced crying compared to infants consuming low beta-palmitate formula.Methods: Formula-fed infants were randomly assigned to receive either (1) formula with high beta-palmitate (HBP, n = 21) or (2) regular formula with a standard vegetable oil mix (LBP, n = 21). A matched group of breastfed infants served as a reference (BF, n = 21). Crying and stool characteristics data were recorded by the parents for 3 days before the 6- and 12-week visits.Results: We found no significant differences in the stool frequency or consistency between the two formula groups. The percentage of crying infants in the LBP group was significantly higher than that in the HBP and BF groups during the evening at 6 weeks (88.2% vs. 56.3% and 55.6%, p < 0.05) and during the afternoon at 12 weeks (91.7% vs. 50.0% and 40%, p < 0.05).

1180,Psychophysiological ante-natal predictors of post-natal depressed mood,"Administered psychometric and physiological measures to 47 women during their pregnancy and 6 wks after birth. The psychometric measures used antenatally and postnatally included the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire, Rotter's Internal‚ÄìExternal Locus of Control Scale, Delusions-Symptoms-States Inventory to measure anxiety, and Self-Rating Depression Scale. Psychophysiological measures used were heart rate and blood pressure. Postnatal ratings of depression were associated with a high antenatal score on overall hostility. Ss with high anxiety and hostility ratings had a more pronounced response to the sound of a baby crying than to noise of similar frequency and intensity. This more pronounced heart response was also related to later postnatal depression ratings. The most useful predictive measure was the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire, because its predictive power in the 1st trimester of pregnancy was almost as good as in the 3rd trimester.

Psychometric measures used antenatally were the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire, Rotter's Internal‚ÄìExternal Locus of Control Scale, and Delusions-Symptoms-States Inventory subscales to measure anxiety and depression. Depression was assessed by the Self-Rating Depression Scale at 6 wks postpartum. Postnatal depression was found to be associated with high antenatal scores on either overall hostility and extrapunitiveness or external locus of control ratings and intrapunitiveness. 19 Ss took part in psychophysiological testing, which utilized heart rate and skin conductance measures. Ss with high anxiety or hostility scores had more pronounced antenatal heart response to the sound of a baby crying than to similar noises. This pronounced response was also related to later postnatal depression.

1183,Insulin pump therapy in toddlers and preschool children with type 1 diabetes mellitus,"OBJECTIVE: To test whether glycemic control in young children could be achieved more effectively and safely by using continuous insulin infusions administered by insulin pumps. STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed the effects of pump therapy in nine toddlers in whom type 1 diabetes developed between the ages of 10 and 40 months. After a mean of 13.7 months of therapy with multiple daily injections, patients were treated with insulin pumps for periods ranging from 7 to 19 months (mean, 12.7 months). RESULTS: Before initiation of pump therapy, HbA1c levels averaged 9.5% +/- 0.4%, and patients had a mean of 0.52 episodes per month of severe hypoglycemia (uncontrolled shaking, inconsolable crying, disorientation, or seizures). After initiation of pump therapy, HbA1c levels declined to 7.9% +/- 0.3% (P <.001 vs prepump levels), and the incidence of severe hypoglycemia decreased to 0.09 episodes per month (P <.05). Normal linear growth and weight gain were maintained during pump therapy. There were no changes in the frequency of physician or emergency room visits for acute hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis. However, the frequency of parental contacts with health personnel declined by >80%, reflecting increasing parental confidence and independence in diabetic care. Subjective assessments revealed significant improvements in quality of life and high levels of satisfaction with pump therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin pump therapy may provide an effective alternative for selected preschool children with type 1 diabetes.","Litton, J. and Rice, A. and Friedman, N. and Oden, J. and Lee, M.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors randomly divided 40 full-term newborns into two groups. In the experimental group, the newborn received kangaroo care from the mother before, during, and after the 20-minute heel blood collection. In the control group, the heel blood collection was performed under conventional conditions. The authors compared the two groups' heart rate, oxygen saturation, facial expressions of pain, and duration of crying. RESULTS: The two groups had no statistically significant difference in terms of gender, birth weight, mode of delivery, and gestational age (p > 0.05). In the seven time periods during the puncture after ten seconds from the beginning and ten seconds after the end, the neonatal heart rates of the two groups changed and statistically significant differences were observed in the duration of heel blood collection, interaction and group factors, as well as in oxygen saturation (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: During heel blood collection, skin contact between the mother and child can relieve pain, reduce changes in heart rate, improve neonatal heel blood oxygen saturation, and enhance the emotional communication between the mother and child.","Liu, M. and Zhao, L. and Li, X.

Results from larger rigorously designed studies will help draw more definitive conclusions. Reviewers' commentary: L. reuteri is useful in reducing the time of infant crying, reduces it an average of 55 minutes per day, but only in mothers under exclusive breastfeeding and cow milk protein-free diet. It is still premature to generalize these results, and it is not known if this strain will work in different populations or if it is cost-effective to give this treatment for 21 days.","Llerena Santa Cruz, E. and Jullien, S.",0,948
1189,Appetite and weight,"The role of appetite in obesity has been studied for over 50 years, but until the 21st century this research focused largely on adults. More recently, researchers have made important strides in evidencing the importance of appetite for risk of both over- and underweight in childhood. The behavioral susceptibility theory of obesity hypothesizes that genetically determined individual differences in appetite cause people to respond differently to the modern ‚Äúobesogenic‚Äù food environment. These differences in appetite confer greater or lower risk of excess weight gain. Evidence from large population based cohort studies has demonstrated that, from early life, appetite is under considerable genetic influence, children display large individual differences in appetitive behaviors, and that these differences prospectively predict early weight gain. This chapter describes the evidence base for Behavioural Susceptibility Theory, and its implications. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Llewellyn, C. H. and Fildes, A.",0,949
1190,Current beliefs and management strategies for treating infant colic,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to describe the current beliefs about the etiology of colic as well as current management approaches used by pediatric health care providers. METHOD: An open-ended, short- answer survey concerning beliefs about the etiology and treatment of colic was conducted at major National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates and Practitioners and American Academy of Pediatric meetings. The two groups of providers surveyed, pediatric nurse practitioners (PNPs) (n = 216) and pediatricians (n = 215), were similar in age and years of practice. RESULTS: PNPs were more likely to define colic as ""excessive crying."" No differences were found in the beliefs regarding etiology of colic. Pediatricians reported seeing more colicky infants per month. A strong relationship existed between etiology and primary treatment approach. Statistically significant differences were found between PNPs and pediatricians in approaches to management of colic. DISCUSSION: Colic remains a prevalent and mysterious malady, with a critical need for more evidence-based treatment protocols. Differences in approaches used by providers were found, with PNPs more likely to use behavioral and environmental approaches to treatment.","Lobo, M. L. and Kotzer, A. M. and Keefe, M.

1191,Temperament as a predictor of behavior for conscious sedation in dentistry,"Temperament can be defined as the behavioral style of a child or the manner in which a child interacts with the environment. Nine temperament categories have been identified: activity level, biological rhythmicity, initial approach/withdrawal, adaptability, intensity, mood, persistence/attention span, distractibility, and sensory threshold. Temperament categories can be quantified using the Toddler Temperament Scale (TTS), a written questionnaire completed by the caretaker. For this study, 29 healthy children, 14 males and 15 females, aged 18 to 36 months (mean age 30 = 6.2 months) and a mean weight of 13.8 kg = 2.1 kg were sedated with 2 mg/kg hydroxyzine pamoate (p.o.) and 2 mg/kg body weight of meperidine (submucosal). Parents completed the TTS during dental treatment in an adjoining room. The recording of baseline vital statistics, the mirror and explorer examination, and the entire operative procedure were videotaped. The Ohio State University Behavior Rating Scale was used to rate the videotapes of each child's behavior according to the following discrete categories: quiet behavior, crying without struggling, and struggling movement with or without crying. For data analysis, all negative behavior (struggling and for crying) was summed. Using a stepwise linear regression, approach/withdrawal tendency (multiple R = 0.38, r2 = 0.15, and P = 0.0015) and adaptability (multiple R = 0.58, r2 = 0.34, and P = 0.009) were found to predict the total percentage of struggling behavior, and approach/withdrawal also approached significance in predicting the percentage of all negative behavior (multiple R = 0.35, r2 = 0.12, and P = 0.055).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","Lochary, M.

1192,Venepuncture versus heel prick for the collection of the Newborn Screening Test,"This study compared the heel prick with venepuncture of a superficial vein on the dorsum of the hand to collect the Newborn Screening Test. Midwives at two different maternity centres collected the blood samples, with midwives at each centre using only one of the two blood collecting approaches being studied. The time taken to collect the Newborn Screening Test and four crying parameters (amount of crying, percentage of crying, length of first cry and cry latency) were measured. Thirty-six infants were assigned to either a control or experimental group and their Newborn Screening Tests were recorded on audiotape. Analysis of the results found a shorter sample collection time, length of crying, duration of the first cry, a lower percentage of crying, and increased cry latency for the venepuncture group","Logan, P.

1193,"Maternal sensitivity in interactions with three- and 12-month-old infants: Stability, structural composition, and developmental consequences","This study addresses three topics related to the structural components of maternal sensitivity: (a) The stability of sensitivity over a nine-month period, (b) the predictability of maternal sensitivity assessed at 12 months from early parameters of parenting and (c) the relation between maternal sensitivity and developmental outcomes assessed at 12 months. Maternal sensitivity and its components (signal perception, correct interpretation, prompt, and appropriate reaction) were evaluated for 60 mother-infant-dyads when their infants were aged three and 12 months. Additional parameters of early parenting were maternal emotional warmth and behavioural contingency. Developmental outcome measures were the amount of infant crying and the quality of attachment at twelve months. The results showed close correlations between the sensitivity components suggesting a unidimensional structure for maternal sensitivity. The sensitivity assessments were significantly related to measures of maternal warmth. Stability of maternal sensitivity over time was, however, quite low. There was no relation between the early sensitivity assessments and later developmental outcomes, whereas there was a significant relation between the sensitivity parameters assessed at twelve months and developmental outcomes. The results indicate changes in the meaning of maternal sensitivity during infants' development.

1194,"Relationships between eye contact, maternal sensivity, and infant crying","This study addresses the longitudinal association between eye contact and maternal sensitivity during the first 12 weeks of the infants' life and relates both variables to the infants' cry behaviour at three months of age. Free-play interactional sequences of 20 mothers were videotaped at weekly intervals. At the infants' age of three months, the mothers were additionally asked to record their infants' cry behaviour using a maternal diary method over a period of three days. The amount of mutual eye contact was assessed microanalytically, and rating procedures were used to assess maternal sensitivity. Duration and frequency of infant crying were taken from the maternal diaries. The results show an increase of eye contact during the first three months, and maternal sensitivity is a stable feature remaining almost unchanged over time. This difference may explain why early sensitivity ratings cannot predict later eye contact rates, whereas, in contrast, early eye contact measures are significantly related to later maternal sensitivity. In addition, the results show that the eye contact rate is (in contrast to maternal sensitivity) related to a decrease in the duration of infants' crying.","Lohaus, A. and Keller, H. and Voelker, S.",1,954
1196,Development of materials to support parents whose babies cry excessively: Findings and health service implications,"Aim To develop evidence-based materials which provide information and support for parents who are concerned about their baby's excessive crying. As well as meeting these parents' needs, the aim was to develop a package of materials suitable for use by the UK National Health Service (NHS).Background Parents report that around 20% of infants in Western countries cry excessively without an apparent reason during the first four months of age. Traditionally, research has focused on the crying and its causes. However, evidence is growing that how parents evaluate and respond to the crying needs to receive equal attention. This focus encompasses parental resources, vulnerabilities, well-being and mental health. At present, the UK NHS lacks a set of routine provisions to support parents who are concerned about their baby's excessive crying. The rationales, methods and findings from a study developing materials for this purpose are reported.Method Following a literature review, 20 parents whose babies previously cried excessively took part in focus groups or interviews. They provided reports on their experiences and the supports they would have liked when their baby was crying excessively. In addition, they identified their preferred delivery methods and devices for accessing information and rated four example support packages identified by the literature review.Findings During the period their baby cried excessively, most parents visited a health service professional and most considered these direct contacts to have provided helpful information and support. Websites were similarly popular. Telephones and tablets were the preferred means of accessing online information. Groups to meet other parents were considered an important additional resource by all the parents. Three package elements-a Surviving Crying website, a printed version of the website and a programme of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy-based support sessions delivered to parents by a qualified practitioner, were developed for further evaluation. ¬© 2018 Cambridge University Press.","Long, J. and Powell, C. and Bamber, D. and Garratt, R. and Brown, J. and Dyson, S. and James-Roberts, I.

1198,Living and coping with excessive infantile crying,"Aim. The aim of the study was to elicit from parents how they lived and coped with a baby who cries excessively. It sought to identify factors which made coping more difficult, as well as interventions perceived by parents to be effective in improving the situation. Background. The excessive crying of a baby can be one of the most trying aspects of parenthood. Although there have been many studies into the cause and treatment of the problem, these have produced little convincing evidence and even less agreement among investigators. In the light of this an alternative approach is to provide effective support to enhance coping until the crying abates. Design. This study was based in pragmatic ethnography and followed an adapted grounded theory approach. A total of 25 adults from 14 families participated, recounting their experiences with 20 babies who either were currently crying excessively or had done so previously while less than 1 year old. Data was collected by a factual questionnaire and tape-recorded focused interviews conducted in the family home augmented by periods of participant observation. Outcomes. Almost every aspect of family life was disrupted, resulting in strained relationships, feelings of guilt, and concerns about losing control. Repeated attempts had to be made to establish a diagnosis and to find a cure. Such attempts failed, leading to a repeated cycle of hope and disappointment. The greatest potential to effect a positive impact lay in the supportive role of health visitors. They needed to visit frequently","Long, T. and Johnson, M.",0,956
1199,Emotional expressiveness of 5‚Äì6 month-old infants born very premature versus full-term at initial exposure to weaning foods,"Facial expressions of 5‚Äì6 month-old infants born preterm and at term were compared while tasting for the first time solid foods (two fruit and two vegetable pur√©es) given by the mother. Videotapes of facial reactions to these foods were objectively coded during the first six successive spoons of each test food using Baby FACS and subjectively rated by na√Øve judges. Infant temperament was also assessed by the parents using the Infant Behaviour Questionnaire. Contrary to our expectations, infants born preterm expressed fewer negative emotions than infants born full-term. Na√Øve judges rated infants born preterm as displaying more liking than their full-term counterparts when tasting the novel foods. The analysis of facial expressions during the six spoonfuls of four successive meals (at 1-week intervals) suggested a familiarization effect with the frequency of negative expressions decreasing after tasting the second spoon, regardless of infant age, type of food and order of presentation. Finally, positive and negative dimensions of temperament reported by the parents were related with objective and subjective coding of affective reactions toward foods in infants born preterm or full-term. Our research indicates that premature infants are more accepting of novel foods than term infants and this could be used for supporting the development of healthy eating patterns in premature infants. Further research is needed to clarify whether reduced negativity by infants born prematurely to the exposure to novel solid foods reflects a reduction of an adaptive avoidant behaviour during the introduction of novel foods. ¬© 2016","Longfier, L. and Soussignan, R. and Reissland, N. and Leconte, M. and Marret, S. and Schaal, B. and Mellier, D.",0,957

1204,Infant microbiota in colic: Predictive associations with problem crying and subsequent child behavior,"Infant colic is a condition of unknown cause which can result in carer distress and attachment difficulties. Recent studies have implicated the gut microbiota in infant colic, and certain probiotics have demonstrated possible efficacy. We aim to investigate whether the intestinal microbiota composition in infants with colic is associated with cry/fuss time at baseline, persistence of cry/fuss at 4-week follow-up, or child behavior at 2 years of age. Fecal samples from infants with colic (n = 118, 53% male) were analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing. After examining the alpha and beta diversity of the clinical samples, we performed a differential abundance analysis of the 16S data to look for taxa that associate with baseline and future behavior, while adjusting for potential confounding variables. In addition, we used random forest classifiers to evaluate how well baseline gut microbiota can predict future crying time. Alpha diversity of the fecal microbiota was strongly influenced by birth mode, feed type, and child gender, but did not significantly associate with crying or behavioral outcomes. Several taxa within the microbiota (including Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, and Klebsiella) associate with colic severity, and the baseline microbiota composition can predict further crying at 4 weeks with up to 65% accuracy. The combination of machine learning findings with associative relationships demonstrates the potential prognostic utility of the infant fecal microbiota in predicting subsequent infant crying problems. ¬© Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease 2020.","Loughman, A. and Quinn, T. and Nation, M.

1205,The cries of infants of differing levels of perceived temperamental difficultness: Acoustic properties and effects on listeners,"Explored the meaning of mothers' perceptions of their infants' temperament. 134 mothers of 4‚Äì6 mo olds were administered the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire. Subjective ratings were elicited from 45 Ss (average age 24.7 yrs) who listened to the cries of the infants perceived by their mothers as having difficult, average, or easy temperament. Ss were administered the Nurturance scale of the Personality Research Form, Empathy Scale, and Postnatal Research Inventory. Results show that Ss rated the difficult- and average-group cries as more irritating and spoiled-sounding than the easy-group cries and more likely to be due to emotional or psychological causes. The meaning of the difficultness designations was also tested by measuring the acoustic properties of the cries of the infants using sound spectrographs. The clearest difference was that the more difficult groups showed increased amounts of pausing within and between cry sounds, which is interpreted as adding a sense of urgent demand to the cry communication. The effects of a variety of listener background, personality, and attitude variables were also considered. The listener's perception of the difficulties of her own 4‚Äì6 mo old firstborn infant was not related to ratings of the cries, but her prior experience with infants and level of self-described empathy were related to the ratings. The more experienced the listener, the less the easy and average infant's cries were rated as spoiled and the more the difficult infant's cries were seen as spoiled.

Breath-holding spells (BHS) are believed to be caused by autonomic dysregulation mediated via the vagus nerve and increased in patients with a family history of BHS. Details and understanding of its pathophysiology are lacking. In this retrospective study of patients with FD, the incidence of BHS was higher at 53.3%, compared with previous studies in normal children. Laughter as a precipitating factor for BHS has not been previously reported in FD and occurred in 10% of patients in this study. Lower lung volumes, chronic lung disease, chronic CO2 retention, and inadequate autonomic compensation occur in those with FD leading to a higher incidence and severity of BHS when crying or laughing. Thus, FD may be a good model for understanding manifestations of the autonomic nervous system dysfunction and contribute to our knowledge of BHS mechanisms.","Maayan, C. and Katz, E. and Begin, M. and Yuvchev, I. and Kharasch, V.

1224,Right from the start: Protocol for a pilot study for a randomised trial of the New Baby Programme for improving outcomes for children born to socially vulnerable mothers,"Background: Children born to mothers who experience social complexity (e.g. substance misuse, intimate partner violence, mental ill health, a history of maltreatment) are at increased risk for a range of adverse outcomes at birth and during development. Home visiting programmes have been advocated as a strategy for improving outcomes for disadvantaged mothers and children, such as the Nurse-Family Partnership for young, socially disadvantaged first-time mothers. However, no evidence-based programme is available for multiparous women or older first-time mothers. The New Baby Programme was developed in Northern Ireland. It augments the universal health visiting service available in the UK with a content designed to promote maternal health and well-being in pregnancy, maximise secure attachments of children and parents and enhance sensitive parenting and infant cognitive development. Methods/Design: This pilot study is designed to investigate whether it is possible to recruit and retain socially vulnerable mothers in a randomised trial that compares the effects of the New Baby Programme with standard antenatal and postnatal care. Feasibility issues include the referral/recruitment pathway (including inclusion and exclusion criteria), the consent and randomisation, the ability to maintain researcher blinding, the acceptability of the intervention to participants, and the feasibility and acceptability of the outcome measures. The results of the study will inform a definitive phase-3 RCT. Discussion: Trials of complex social interventions often encounter challenges that lead to the trial being abandoned (e.g. because of problems in recruitment) or present considerable analytic challenges relating to dropout, attrition and bias. This pilot study aims to maximise the chances of successful implementation. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","Macdonald, G. and Alderdice, F. and Clarke, M. and Perra, O. and Lynn, F. and McShane, T. and Millen, S.",0,977

Therefore, feeding infants rice cereal in the bottle before bedtime does not appear to make much difference in their sleeping through the night. ¬© 1989, American Medical Association.

1229,Trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms in the early childhood period and family-wide clustering of risk,"Background Previous research on individual differences in the course of maternal depressive symptoms has yielded inconsistent findings, with significant variation in the number and pattern of trajectories identified. In addition, missing from the literature is a comprehensive examination of predictors and longitudinal consequences of particular depression trajectories. Method Participants in this study included a community cohort of 501 women assessed for depression using the Center for Epidemiologic Depression Scale at infant age 2, 18, 36, and 54 months. A multi-informant approach was used to examine predictors and outcomes of trajectory membership. Results Using growth mixture modeling, three distinct trajectories emerged: 84% of the sample demonstrated low-stable levels of depressive symptoms, 9.5% had high-decreasing scores, and 6.5% had moderate-increasing scores. While socioeconomic status and marital conflict differentiated the low-stable group from the high-decreasing and moderate-increasing group, neighborhood collective efficacy differentiated the latter two groups. At 54 months, a clustering of family risks was prevalent for the moderate-increasing depression group, including higher marital conflict and household chaos, lower parental positivity, and heightened levels of child psychopathology. Limitations Limitations include reliance on self-reports to assess maternal depression and the relatively small sample size of certain trajectory classes. Conclusions The onset and course of maternal depression in the early childrearing period is heterogeneous, with distinct subgroups in the population. Comprehensive assessment of individual, family, and neighborhood stressors augments our understanding of the predictors and consequences of trajectory membership over this critical period of child and family adaptation. ¬© 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Madigan, S. and Wade, M. and Plamondon, A. and Jenkins, J.

1230,Child dietary and eating behavior outcomes up to 3.5 years after an early feeding intervention: The NOURISH RCT,"Objective: To evaluate dietary intake impact outcomes up to 3.5 years after the NOURISH early feeding intervention (concealed allocation, assessor masked randomized controlled trial). Methods: In this study, 698 first-time mothers with healthy term infants were allocated to receive anticipatory guidance on protective feeding practices or usual care. Outcomes were assessed at 2, 3.7, and 5 years (3.5 years post-intervention). Dietary intake was assessed by 24-h recall and Child Dietary Questionnaire. Mothers completed a food preference questionnaire and Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Linear mixed models assessed group, time, and time √ó group effects. Results: There were no group or time √ó group effects for fruit, vegetable, discretionary food, and nonmilk sweetened beverage intake. Intervention children showed a higher preference for fruit (74.6% vs. 69.0% liked, P < 0.001), higher Child Dietary Questionnaire score for fruit and vegetables (15.3 vs. 14.5, target ‚â•18, P = 0.03), lower food responsiveness (2.3 vs. 2.4, of maximum 5, P = 0.04), and higher satiety responsiveness (3.1 vs. 3.0, of maximum 5, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Compared with usual care, an early feeding intervention providing anticipatory guidance regarding positive feeding practices led to small improvements in child dietary score, food preferences, and eating behaviors up to 5 years of age, but not in dietary intake measured by 24-h recall. ¬© 2016 The Obesity Society","Magarey, A. and Mauch, C. and Mallan, K. and Perry, R. and Elovaris, R. and Meedeniya, J. and Byrne, R. and Daniels, L.",0,982
1231,Patterns of Disruptive Feeding Behaviors in Infants with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome,"Background: Severe irritability in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome often impacts their ability to feed successfully, which challenges a mother's ability to demonstrate this most basic parenting skill. There is little empiric evidence to guide recommendations for practice in this population. Purpose: Describe the infant behaviors that disrupt feeding in infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome. Methods: A mixed-method approach was used to describe digitally recorded infant feeding behaviors. Qualitative methodology was first used to identify categories of behaviors during the feeding. The categories were used as a coding scheme to identify the temporal sequence, duration, and frequency of behaviors observed during a feeding. Results: The behavior categories that disrupted feeding were identified as fussing, resting, crying, and sleeping/sedated. Infants spent almost twice as much time in fussing as in feeding. The majority of the infants were fussing between 1 and 11 minutes during the feeding, and fussing disrupted feeding in every subject at least once. Feeding behavior occurred only 24% of the time, while fussing and crying occurred 51%. Fussing was the primary transitional behavior from one category to another. Infants who did not complete their feeding had nearly twice the mean number of fussing episodes as those who completed their feeding. Implications for Practice: Fussing is a transitional state and appears to provide an opportunity to test interventions that help the mothers reengage their infants in feeding. The frequency of the behavioral transitions provides a measure of irritability that has not been previously described in this population. Implications for Research: Additional study is needed to evaluate the impact and contributions of maternal behaviors and external variables on infant behavioral transition.

Additional characteristics, including clenching of the fists and flexion of the hips, have led to the suggestion that these behaviors are related to abdominal discomfort. In this article, we show emerging evidence to support the concept that infant colic could represent gut inflammation and microbial dysbiosis that impacts brain function and even brain development.","Mai, T. and Fatheree, N.

1234,Early Development of Food Preferences and Healthy Eating Habits in Infants and Young Children,"Children's vegetable consumption falls below current recommendations, highlighting the need to identify strategies that can successfully promote better acceptance of vegetables. Recently, we described two promising approaches to increase the acceptance of vegetables: (a) offering infants a variety of vegetables (pur√©e changed every day for 10 days vs. 3 days and no change) at the beginning of weaning increases acceptance of new foods, including vegetables, and (b) offering 7-month-old infants an initially disliked vegetable at 8 subsequent meals markedly increases acceptance for that vegetable. The first stage of the study showed that these different effects persisted for several weeks. In a follow-up study, at 6 years, observations in an experimental setting showed that children who had been breastfed and who had experienced high vegetable variety at the start of weaning ate more new vegetables and liked them more. They were also more willing to taste vegetables than formula-fed children or the no- or low-variety groups. The initially disliked vegetable was still liked by 57% of children. This brief review shows that experience with sensory variety in the context of breastfeeding, early experiences with vegetable variety during complementary feeding, and repeated experience with an initially disliked vegetable can influence food preferences and healthy eating habits into childhood. ¬© 2019 Nestl√© Nutrition Institute, Switzerland/S.

1235,Association between sleep position and early motor Development,"Objective: To compare motor performance in infants sleeping in prone versus supine positions. Study design: Healthy 4-month-olds (supine: n = 71, prone: n = 12) and 6-month olds (supine: n = 50, prone: n = 22) were evaluated with the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and Peabody Developmental Motor Scale (PDMS), and parents completed a positioning diary. Infants were reassessed at 15 months. Results: At 4 months, motor scores were lower in the supine group and were less likely to achieve prone extension (P < .05). At 6 months, there were wide discrepancies on the AIMS (supine: 44.5 ¬± 21.6, prone: 60.0 ¬± 18.8, P = .005) and the gross motor PDMS (supine: 85.7 ¬± 7.6, prone: 90.2 ¬± 9.5, P = .03). Motor delays were documented in 22% of babies sleeping supine. Prone sleep-positioned infants were more likely to sit and roll. Daily exposure to awake prone positioning was predictive of motor performance in infants sleeping supine. At 15 months, sleep position continued to predict motor performance. Conclusions: Infants sleeping supine may exhibit early motor lags, associated with less time in prone while awake. This has implications for accurate interpretation of assessment of infants at risk and prevention of inappropriate referrals. Rate of infant motor development appears influenced by extrinsic factors such as positioning practices. ¬© 2006 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.","Majnemer, A. and Barr, R. G.",0,986

1237,"Evaluation of the safety, tolerance and efficacy of 1-year consumption of infant formula supplemented with Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263: A randomized controlled trial","Background: The microorganism present in breast milk, added to other factors, determine the colonization of infants. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and effects of the consumption of a milk formula during the first year of life that is supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263, two strains originally isolated from breast milk. Methods: A randomized, double blind, controlled, parallel group study including healthy, formula-fed infants was conducted. Two hundred and thirty-six 1-month-old infants were selected and randomly divided into three study groups according to a randomization list. Infants in the control group received a standard powdered infant formula until 12 months of age. Infants in the probiotic groups received the same infant formula but supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or B. breve CECT7263. Main outcome was weigh-gain of infants as safety marker. Results: One hundred and eighty-nine infants completed the eleven months of intervention (61 in control group, 65 in Lf group and 63 in Bb group).

1238,"The Relationship between Number of Fruits, Vegetables, and Noncore Foods Tried at Age 14 Months and Food Preferences, Dietary Intake Patterns, Fussy Eating Behavior, and Weight Status at Age 3.7 Years","Objective: We examined whether exposure to a greater number of fruits, vegetables, and noncore foods (ie, nutrient poor and high in saturated fats, added sugars, or added salt) at age 14 months was related to children's preference for and intake of these foods as well as maternal-reported food fussiness and measured child weight status at age 3.7 years. Methods: This study reports secondary analyses of longitudinal data from mothers and children (n=340) participating in the NOURISH randomized controlled trial. Exposure was quantified as the number of food items (n=55) tried by a child from specified lists at age 14 months. At age 3.7 years, food preferences, intake patterns, and fussiness (also at age 14 months) were assessed using maternal-completed, established questionnaires. Child weight and length/height were measured by study staff at both age points. Multivariable linear regression models were tested to predict food preferences, intake patterns, fussy eating, and body mass index z score at age 3.7 years adjusting for a range of maternal and child covariates. Results: Having tried a greater number of vegetables, fruits, and noncore foods at age 14 months predicted corresponding preferences and higher intakes at age 3.7 years but did not predict child body mass index z score. Adjusting for fussiness at age 14 months, having tried more vegetables at age 14 months was associated with lower fussiness at age 3.7 years. Conclusions: These prospective analyses support the hypothesis that early taste and texture experiences influence subsequent food preferences and acceptance. These findings indicate introduction to a variety of fruits and vegetables and limited noncore food exposure from an early age are important strategies to improve later diet quality. ¬© 2016 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.","Mallan, K.

1244,High-resolution cry analysis in preterm newborn infants,"Infant monitoring is a common procedure in clinical practice in neonatal critical care units. A number of vital functions are monitored, such as heart beat, breathing, blood flow, etc. Specifically, preterm and/or low-birth-weight infants often present respiratory problems that require monitoring. These may range from insufficient ventilation to apnoea. One of the most common events that may affect the respiratory flow is crying, a physiological action made by the infant to communicate and draw attention, but, for a preterm infant, this action requires great effort, which may cause distress and even may have an adverse impact on blood oxygenation. Acoustic analysis of newborn infant cry is thus of importance, since it is related to other basic neuro-physiological parameters. Being easy to perform, cheap and completely non-invasive, it can be successfully applied in many circumstances. The newborn infant cry is characterised by very high fundamental frequency (F(0)) and resonance frequency (RFs) values, with abrupt changes and voiced/unvoiced features of very short duration in a single utterance. To deal with such signals, a new user-friendly software tool has been developed, that allows robust tracking of main acoustic parameters on very short and time-varying signal frames. The software developed provides the user with a high-resolution picture of the cry signal characteristics.","Manfredi, C. and Bocchi, L. and Orlandi, S. and Spaccaterra, L. and Donzelli, G. P.",0,991
1245,Developmental and Temperamental Differences in Emotion Regulation in Infancy,"One of the major adaptations during the infancy period is the development of the ability to cope with arousing or uncertain events. The following study was designed to examine emotion regulation strategy use between 6 and 18 months. 75 infants (25 each of 6‚Äê, 12‚Äê, and 18‚Äêmonth‚Äêolds) were videotaped interacting with 3 female strangers. Coping strategies were coded using a portable computer with a continuous sampling program, enabling coders to record both frequencies and durations of behaviors. Results indicated that 6‚Äêmonth‚Äêolds were more likely than 12‚Äê or 18‚Äêmonth‚Äêolds to use gaze aversion and fussing as their primary emotion regulation strategies, and were less likely than the older infants to use self‚Äêsoothing and self‚Äêdistraction. 18‚Äêmonth‚Äêolds were more likely than the younger infants to attempt to direct their interactions with the strangers. Infants' strategy use also differed as a function of their wariness of strangers, particularly at 12 months of age. Copyright ¬© 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved","Mangelsdorf, S.

1246,Predictors of breastfeeding duration in a predominantly MƒÅori population in New Zealand,"Background: Although breastfeeding duration in New Zealand's indigenous MƒÅori is shorter than in non-MƒÅori, we know little about barriers or motivators of breastfeeding in this community. The aim of this analysis was to identify predictors for extended duration of breastfeeding amongst participants drawn from predominantly MƒÅori communities in regional Hawke's Bay. Methods: Mother/baby dyads were recruited from two midwifery practices serving predominantly MƒÅori women in mostly deprived areas, for a randomised controlled trial comparing the risks and benefits of an indigenous sleeping device (wahakura) and a bassinet. Questionnaires were administered at baseline (pregnancy) and at one, three and six months postnatal. Several questions relating to breastfeeding and factors associated with breastfeeding were included. The data from both groups were pooled to examine predictors of breastfeeding duration. Results: MƒÅori comprised 70.5% of the 197 participants recruited. The median time infants were fully breastfed was eight weeks and MƒÅori women were more likely to breastfeed for a shorter duration than New Zealand European women with an odds-ratio (OR) of 0.45 (95% CI 0.24, 0.85). The key predictors for extended duration of breastfeeding were the strong support of the mother's partner (OR = 3.64, 95% CI 1.76, 7.55) or her mother for breastfeeding (OR = 2.47, 95% CI 1.27, 4.82), longer intended duration of maternal breastfeeding (OR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00, 1.03) and being an older mother (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.02, 1.12). The key predictors for shorter duration of breastfeeding were pacifier use (OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.17, 0.46), daily cigarette smoking (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.37, 0.69), alcohol use (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.31, 0.93) and living in a more deprived area (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.22, 0.72). Conclusions: Breastfeeding duration in this group of mainly MƒÅori women was shorter than the national average. Increasing the duration of breastfeeding by these mothers could be further facilitated by ante and postnatal education involving their own mothers and their partners in the support of breastfeeding and by addressing pacifier use, smoking and alcohol use. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","Manhire, K.

This design eliminates shared genes as an explanation for similarities between parent and child. Structural equation modeling indicated that T1 marital instability predicted T2 child sleep problems, but T1 child sleep problems did not predict T2 marital instability. This result was replicated when models were estimated separately for mothers and fathers. Thus, even after controlling for stability in sleep problems and marital instability and eliminating shared genetic influences on associations using a longitudinal adoption design, marital instability prospectively predicts early childhood sleep patterns. ¬© 2011 The Authors.

1249,A birth intervention: The therapeutic effects of doula support versus lamaze preparation on first-time mothers' working models of caregiving,"Context ‚Ä¢ A working model of caregiving has been defined as an internalized schema of caregiving that guides a mother's behavior with her infant. This schema is strongly influenced by the mother's first attachment relationship with her own mother, which frequently operates outside her conscious awareness. Objective ‚Ä¢ To examine doula support at birth as an intervention that might correct distortions of a mother's unconscious schema of caregiving, promoting more secure caregiving following childbirth. Design ‚Ä¢ The effects of doula support versus Lamaze birth preparation on the working models of caregiving of 35 first-time pregnant mothers were compared. Interventions ‚Ä¢ An interview was used to assess the mothers' working models in the third trimester of pregnancy and again 4 months after the mothers gave birth. Mood state and self-esteem were measured at these times. A post hoc analysis was performed on the mothers' birth experiences, the quality of their postpartum support, and their evaluations of their infants' temperaments. Results ‚Ä¢ The prebirth to postbirth rating analysis of the interviews revealed that the mothers in the doula group were significantly less rejecting and helpless in their working models of caregiving than were the mothers in the Lamaze group. The mothers in the doula group also showed greater security than did mothers in the Lamaze group, a difference that approached but did not reach significance. In addition, the women in the doula group were less emotionally distressed and had higher self-esteem than did the women in the Lamaze group, and the women in the doula group rated their infants as significantly less fussy than the mothers in the Lamaze group rated their infants. Conclusions ‚Ä¢ When viewed in the context of working models of caregiving, mothers who used a doula were significantly less rejecting and helpless, and approached significantly higher scores on the secure scale, than did mothers who used Lamaze birth preparation. Mothers rated as secure showed significantly less mood disturbance and higher prebirth and postbirth self-esteem than did mothers rated as insecure, providing construct validity for the caregiving interviews.","Manning-Orenstein, G.",0,996
1250,"Mother's early perception of her infant's difficult temperament, parenting stress and early mother-infant interaction","The current study investigated factors contributing to mother's early perception of her infant's difficult temperament. One hundred and twenty-four mother-infant dyads participated in the study. Mother's perception of the infant's temperament was assessed with the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire (ICQ). The influence of mother-infant interaction, mother's mental health and parenting stress were investigated. Mother-infant interaction was videotaped during a face-to-face interaction and analysed using the Global Rating Scale. Mother's mental health was assessed through a structured interview (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, SCID) and parenting stress was examined by a questionnaire (Parenting Stress Index). First, the difficultness scale of the ICQ was used as a continuous variable and factors contributing to mother's perception of her infant's temperament as more or less difficult were examined. Secondly, infants were categorized into difficult and non-difficult, and factors increasing the infant's risk of being perceived as difficult were examined. The model including mother's mental health and parental distress accounted for 24% of the variance in perceived infant difficultness, with parental distress in particular being an influential contributor. When infants categorized as difficult were examined, mother's intrusiveness and infant's poor interactive behaviour in early mother-infant interaction as well as parental distress significantly increased the infant's risk of being perceived as difficult.","M√§ntymaa, M. and Puura, K. and Luoma, I. and Salmelin, R.

1252,Individual differences in mood in early childhood: their relation to gender and neonatal sex steroids,"Predominant mood states were assessed for 104 children via 24-hr mother diaries during the first 2 years of life. Consistent sex differences were found across ages and across cohorts: boys were more often reported to be in a happy/excited mood, girls in a quiet/calm mood. The sexes did not differ in the frequency of negative moods (including crying), however. Scores for happy/excited and quiet/calm mood states were quite stable across the ages sampled: 6, 9, 12, 18, and 26 months. These stabilities were generally greater for boys. Negative moods showed only borderline stability. Relationships between the mood scores and five sex-steroid hormones (progesterone, androstenedione, testosterone, estrone, and estradiol), assayed from umbilical cord blood at the time of the children's birth, were assessed. For boys small, but significant, positive relationships were found between happy/excited moods and androstenedione, estrone, and progesterone. Correlations of opposite sign were found between these hormones and boys' scores for quiet/calm mood. For girls, the correlations were low and insignificant, but generally of opposite sign from those found for boys, and a number of hormones showed significant sex-by-hormone interactions in their relation to children's mood scores. The implication of these findings for the understanding of sex differences is discussed. Also discussed are the problems of interpretation posed by the intercorrelations among hormones when hormone scores are used for prediction of aspects of later development.","Marcus, J. and Maccoby, E.

1253,Inhalation treatment: errors in application and difficulties in acceptance of the devices are frequent in wheezy infants and young children,"The recent availability of small-volume spacers has facilitated the general use of inhaled treatment in infants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate any errors made by parents when using this new inhalation technique and the child's behavior during the inhalation. Ninety-four young children (61% boys) under 5 years of age were enrolled in the study. Inhalation treatment was recommended either by a general practitioner or by a pediatrician. Data concerning treatment regimens, the ability of parents to use the spacer and metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), and the acceptance of the devices, were collected by means of a demonstration and questionnaire. Unexpectedly, the doses, administration times, and duration of the treatments varied from one child to the next. No explanation or training in administering the treatment via the spacers was given to 12% and 47% of the parents, respectively. Fourteen per cent of parents did not shake the MDIs, 12% did not monitor the valves, and 22% allowed too short a time for inhalation. The lack of explanation increased the occurrence of errors in manipulation of the devices. The procedure was judged to be easy to follow by 78% of the parents, but the face mask was accepted with difficulty by 22% of the children. Repeated crying during administration of the treatment was observed in 38% of the patients, particularly the youngest. Crying influenced the acceptance of the face mask, reduced parental compliance, and made the use of the devices more difficult. Errors altering the efficiency of inhalation treatment in infants are frequent. Most of these errors could be avoided by spending more time to inform the parents about correct usage. Furthermore, repeated crying during inhalation is common in young children and this problem should to be taken into consideration in the evaluation of treatment.","Marguet, C. and Couderc, L. and Le Roux, P. and Jeannot, E. and Lefay, V. and Mallet, E.",0,1000

1255,"Lead and zinc concentrations in household dust and toenails of the residents (Estarreja, Portugal): a source-pathway-fate model","This paper describes a methodology developed to assess and apportion probable indoor and outdoor sources of potentially toxic elements while identifying chemical signatures in the household dust collected from private homes in an industrial city (Estarreja, central Portugal). Oral bioaccessibility estimates and the chemical composition of toenail clippings were used to assess indoor dust ingestion as a potential exposure pathway and further investigate exposure-biomarker relationships. Indoor and paired outdoor dust samples were collected from each household. A total of 30 individuals, who provided toenail clippings and a self-reported questionnaire, were recruited for the study. Total concentrations of 34 elements, including lead and zinc, were determined in washed toenail samples and household dust via Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry. The oral bioaccessibility was estimated using the Unified BARGE Method. The enrichment factor shows that lead was enriched (10 < EF < 100) while zinc (EF > 100) was anomalously enriched in the household dust, thus indicating potential exposure in the home environment. The results from principal component analysis coupled to cluster analysis and linear discriminant analysis suggested that mixed contamination derived from multiple sources with a predominance of biomass burning. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed to model toenail data using the indoor dust elemental composition. Whereas the model obtained for lead was not reliable, indoor dust zinc and antimony contents arose as good predictors of toenail zinc. The exposure-biomarker relationships seem to be influenced by the oral bioaccessibility of the elements. ¬© The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Marinho Reis, A. P. and Cave, M. and Sousa, A.

To determine the validity of this assumption, we interviewed 36 mothers of toddlers who were living in a poor shanty town of Lima, Peru. Data from 32 women were complete and used in this analysis. Mothers described their beliefs, practices, and decisions about breastfeeding, weaning, and relactation (the reintroduction of breastfeeding after weaning). We recorded attempted weaning events if the mother reported (1) purposefully not breastfeeding with the intention to wean, or (2) carrying out an action that was believed to cause the child to stop breastfeeding. Using a constant comparative approach, references to child-feeding decisions were coded, categorized, and analyzed. All mothers breastfed for at least 12 months","Marquis, G.

1258,Neonatal withdrawal syndrome after chronic maternal drinking of mate,"The premature newborn of a mother who reported drinking mate during pregnancy presented with increased jitteriness and irritability, high-pitched cry, hypertonia in the limbs, and brisk tendon reflexes consistent with neonatal withdrawal syndrome. High concentrations of caffeine and theobromine were detected in various maternal and neonatal biological matrices (placenta, cord serum, neonatal urine, maternal and neonatal hair, meconium, and breast milk), demonstrating both acute and chronic prenatal and postnatal exposure to these methylxanthines, contained in high amounts in homemade mate. Symptoms progressively disappeared at 84 hours of age, although intermittent irritability was still present when the infant was discharged at 24 days of age. Fluctuating caffeine (and theobromine) content in different breast milk feeds likely generated the baby's irritability, due to either the physiological stimulatory effects of the methylxanthines or postnatal withdrawal syndrome as the substances cleared from the body. The mother was strongly advised to initiate a considerable, progressive, constant reduction of mate consumption to a maximum of 2 cups a day for the duration of breastfeeding.","Mart√≠n, I. and L√≥pez-V√≠lchez, M.

After obtaining the data and statistical analysis, the protocol was re-designed and administered to 100 infants. The aim of this study is to present an efficient and effective lingual frenulum protocol with scores for infants. From the experimental protocol model, a new protocol was designed. One speech-language pathologist, and specialist in orofacial myology, administered the new protocol to 100 full-term infants. All steps of the protocol were recorded and photographed. The data collected was sent to two specialists in the area, who evaluated the cases based on the recordings and photographs. The data from the three evaluations were compared. A two-part protocol was designed to evaluate the lingual frenulum in infants. The first part consists of clinical history with specific questions about family history and breastfeeding. The second part consists of clinical examination: anatomo-functional, non-nutritive and nutritive sucking evaluations. A new lingual frenulum protocol with scores for infants was designed, and has proved to be an effective tool for health professionals to assess and diagnose anatomical alterations of the lingual frenulum, and its possible interference with breastfeeding.","Martinelli, R.

1261,Lessons from healthcare utilization in children with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome,"Introduction and objectives Paediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnoea-Hypopnoea Syndrome (OSAS) is a multisystemic condition affecting child's health status that may be investigated analyzing demand for healthcare. Objective: to quantify the frequency of medical consultations in children with OSAS over a 5-year period, compared to a healthy population. Methods A longitudinal, case-control, ambispective study was conducted at a hospital pertaining to the national public health system. 69 consecutive children referred for OSAS were recruited with no diseases other than OSAS so that healthcare demand was purely attributed to this condition. Matched healthy control children were selected to compare these data. Data regarding frequency of the medical consultations were obtained over 5 years: the year of the treatment (‚ÄúYear0‚Äù), 1 and 2 years before (‚ÄúYear -1‚Äù and ‚ÄúYear -2‚Äù respectively), and 1 and 2 years after treatment (‚ÄúYear +1‚Äù and ‚ÄúYear +2‚Äù) Results Frequentation Index (FI), as ratio between the use of health services by OSAS children and healthy controls was 1.89 during Year-2, and 2.15 during Year-1 (P<.05). Treatment diminishes utilization, with FI of 159 during year +1 and 1.72 during year +2 (P<.05). The main causes of attendance were otolaryngological and pneumological diseases, improving after treatment. Conclusions Children suffering from OSAS demand more healthcare services, at least 2 years before treatment, implying that the disease could be present years before we manage it. Therapeutic actions improve healthcare services utilization, although remain higher than for controls, which suggests OSAS sequelae or residual disease. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Espa√±a, S.L.U. and Sociedad Espa√±ola de Otorrinolaringolog√≠a y Cirug√≠a de Cabeza y Cuello","Martinez-Beneyto, P. and Soria Checa, C.

1262,Maternal parenting predicts infant biobehavioral regulation among women with a history of childhood maltreatment,"Early biobehavioral regulation, a major influence of later adaptation, develops through dyadic interactions with caregivers. Thus, identification of maternal characteristics that can ameliorate or exacerbate infants' innate vulnerabilities is key for infant well-being and long-term healthy development. The present study evaluated the influence of maternal parenting, postpartum psychopathology, history of childhood maltreatment, and demographic risk on infant behavioral and physiological (i.e., salivary cortisol) regulation using the still-face paradigm. Our sample included 153 women with high rates of childhood maltreatment experiences. Mother-infant dyads completed a multimethod assessment at 7 months of age. Structural equation modeling showed that maternal positive (i.e., sensitive, warm, engaged, and joyful) and negative (i.e., overcontrolling and hostile) behaviors during interactions were associated with concurrent maternal depressive symptoms, single parent status, and low family income. In turn, positive parenting predicted improved infant behavioral regulation (i.e., positive affect and social behaviors following the stressor) and decreased cortisol reactivity (i.e., posttask levels that were similar to or lower than baseline cortisol). These findings suggest increased risk for those women experiencing high levels of depressive symptoms postpartum and highlight the importance of maternal positive interactive behaviors during the first year for children's neurodevelopment.

1263,Predictors and outcomes of suicidal ideation during peripartum period,"Introduction: Suicide belongs to the leading causes of maternal perinatal mortality and suicidal ideation is one of the strongest predictors for suicide attempt and completion and thus represents an opportunity for early intervention prior to self and infant harm. This post-hoc analysis aims to investigate predictors of peripartum suicidality (PS) and potential maternal and infant outcomes of PS. Methods: In the prospective-longitudinal Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) study, n = 306 women were repeatedly examined from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum using interviews (Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women) and questionnaires (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Brief Symptom Inventory) to obtain sociodemographic, gynecological and offspring characteristics as well as information about PS (thoughts of death/self-harm, suicide plans, suicide attempt). Results: PS was indicated by n = 15 women. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression revealed a history of suicide attempt (OR = 17.84, 95%CI: 4.61‚Äì69.05), living together with the partner (OR = 0.14, 95%CI: 0.03‚Äì0.63), and social support (OR = 0.35, 95%CI: 0.13‚Äì0.91) as significant predictors for PS (model fit: AUC = 0.7926). As compared to women with no PS, infants of women with PS presented lower scores in neuropsychological development (p = 0.020). Limitations: This post-hoc analysis was conducted with the aim of generating hypotheses for future research. The small number of women who indicated PS limits the statistical power. Conclusion: PS is an important perinatal complication that requires clinical attention. Larger prospective studies are warranted to verify the findings. This will lead to improved preventive and therapeutic approaches and a better understanding of the motives behind maternal suicide and infanticide. ¬© 2019","Martini, J. and Bauer, M. and Lewitzka, U. and Voss, C. and Pfennig, A. and Ritter, D. and Wittchen, H.

1264,"Infant, maternal, and familial predictors and correlates of regulatory problems in early infancy: The differential role of infant temperament and maternal anxiety and depression","Background Excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems are likely to emerge from the complex interplay of various factors. Aims To investigate the role of infant (e.g., temperament), maternal (e.g., anxiety and depressive disorders), and familial (e.g., social support) factors as potential precursors of infant regulatory problems. Study Design Prospective-longitudinal study. Subjects 286 mother-infant dyads were investigated from early pregnancy until 16 months postpartum via questionnaires and interviews. Outcome measures Regulatory problems at 2, 4 and 16 months postpartum assessed by standardized diagnostic interviews. Results Fussy infant temperament and maternal anxiety disorders were associated with excessive infant crying (OR=1.16, 95%CI:1.05-1.29, OR=3.28, 95%CI:1.16-9.26) and feeding problems (OR=1.05, 95%CI:1.01-1.11, OR=2.27, 95%CI:1.36-3.80) whereas maternal depressive disorders were associated with infant sleeping problems (OR=2.55, 95%CI:1.06-6.11). Moreover, high maternal age (OR=0.86, 95%CI:0.75-0.98) was associated with a lower risk for excessive crying and being a single mother (OR=0.16, 95%CI:0.03-0.73) and cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions (OR: 0.59, 95%CI:0.36-0.96) was associated with a lower risk for sleeping problems. Conclusion Excessive infant crying and feeding problems may be related to interactional deficits of anxious mothers who perceive their infants as ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù during soothing or feeding situations. Sleeping problems may be transmitted already during pregnancy by an altered sleep-wake-rhythm of mothers with a history of depression or by a genetic predisposition. Therapeutic interventions should focus on maternal anxiety and depression, behavior management techniques to cope with difficult situations with ‚Äúfussy‚Äù infants and potential protective factors (e.g. favorable maternal emotion regulation) to address crying, feeding and sleeping problems. ¬© 2017","Martini, J. and Petzoldt, J. and Knappe, S. and Garthus-Niegel, S. and Asselmann, E. and Wittchen, H.

1265,Predictors of diagnosis of child psychiatric disorder in adult-infant social-communicative interaction at 12 months,"To establish which social interactive behaviours predict later psychiatric diagnosis, we examined 180 videos of a parent-infant interaction when children were aged one year, from within the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Sixty of the videos involved infants who were later diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder at seven years, and 120 were a randomly selected sex-matched control group. Interactive behaviours for both the caregiver and the one year old infant were coded from the videos according to eight holistic categories of interpersonal engagement: Well-being, Contingent Responsiveness, Cooperativeness, Involvement, Activity, Playfulness, Fussiness, and Speech. Lower levels of adult activity and speech in interaction at one year significantly predicted overall diagnosis of child psychiatric disorder. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Marwick, H. and Doolin, O. and Allely, C.

1268,Fussy eating and feeding difficulties in infants and toddlers consuming a cows' milk exclusion diet,"Background: Cows' milk allergy (CMA) is the most common infant food allergy in the United Kingdom, requiring a strict exclusion diet. Feeding difficulties and fussy eating are also very common problems in young children and can negatively influence feeding and dietary intake in an infant with CMA. The aim of this study was to compare the levels of fussy eating and feeding difficulties in two groups of young children: a group consuming an exclusion diet for CMA and a control group of children consuming an unrestricted diet. Method: Participants were recruited from allergy and health visitor clinics on the Isle of Wight. Parents completed a number of questionnaires about their child's feeding behaviour. Results: One hundred and twenty-six participants (mean age 13 months) were recruited. Participants consuming an exclusion diet for CMA had significantly higher scores for both fussy eating and feeding difficulties (p < 0.05), although overall both groups were within the normal range. A number of symptoms were found to be positively moderately correlated with higher feeding difficulty score (p < 0.05). A higher consumption of milk/milk substitute consumed per day was positively correlated to both feeding difficulties and fussy eating (p < 0.05).

1269,Dietary variety and food group consumption in children consuming a cows' milk exclusion diet,"Background: Dietary variety is defined as the number of different foods or food groups consumed over a given reference period, the consensus being that dietary variety and dietary quality are positively correlated. Recently there has been considerable interest in the association between infant dietary variety and atopic disease. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 8- to 27-month-old children from the Isle of Wight, UK, including two groups: a group of children consuming a cows' milk exclusion (CME) diet and a control group of children consuming an unrestricted diet. Parents completed a validated food frequency questionnaire, from which dietary variety and consumption of food groups were calculated. Growth measurements were recorded. Results: A total of 126 participants of mean age 13.0 months were recruited. In addition to the expected differences in dairy and soya consumption, the CME group consumed sweet foods 1.6 times less frequently, non-water drinks seven times less frequently (p < 0.05) and ready-made baby foods 15 times more frequently (p < 0.01) than the control group. Overall dietary variety was significantly lower in the CME group (p < 0.01) as was variety of meat and sweet foods consumed. There was a greater concern with healthy eating in the CME group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Children consuming an exclusion diet for cows' milk allergy have an overall less varied diet, including a less varied consumption of meat and sweet foods. Efforts should be made to ensure exclusion diets are as varied as possible to optimize nutritional intake. ¬© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

1270,Cows' milk exclusion diet during infancy: Is there a long-term effect on children's eating behaviour and food preferences?,"Background: Dietary restriction during infancy may influence later eating behaviour. The aim of this study was to determine whether consuming a cows' milk exclusion (CME) diet during infancy affects eating habits in later childhood, once cows' milk has been reintroduced into the diet. Methods: Children were recruited from two large birth cohort studies in the UK. A small number of participants were recruited from allergy clinic. Two groups were recruited: an experimental group of children who had consumed a CME diet during infancy and a control group, who had consumed an unrestricted diet during infancy. Parents and children completed questionnaires regarding eating behaviour and food preferences. Results: In total, 101 children of mean age 11.5 years were recruited (28 CME and 73 controls). The CME group scored significantly higher on 'slowness of eating' and on the combined 'avoidant eating behaviour' construct (p < 0.01). The number of foods avoided and symptoms was associated with higher levels of avoidant eating behaviour (p < 0.05). The CME group rated liking for several dairy foods (butter, cream, chocolate, full fat milk and ice cream) significantly lower than the control group (p < 0.05), although there were no significant differences seen for any other category of food. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that consuming a CME diet during infancy has persistent and long-term effects on eating habits and food preferences. To reduce future negative eating behaviours, children's exclusion diets need to be as varied as possible and reintroduction of cows' milk products closely monitored. ¬© 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Maslin, K. and Grundy, J. and Glasbey, G. and Dean, T. and Arshad, S.

Infants in the drowsy/sleeping states scored significantly lower on the Neonatal Infant Pain Score (NIPS) (median score 5) at 30 seconds post stimulus compared with infants in higher states of alertness (median score 6). They also had a shorter total duration of cry (29.17 sec ¬± 8.95 vs 32.67 sec ¬± 9.82). However, there was no difference in the NIPS score between the two groups at 45 seconds post stimulus.

1276,Psychosocial predictors of primiparous breastfeeding initiation and duration,"Background: Many US women fall short of meeting the recommendations on breastfeeding. Whereas prenatal demographic factors have been well researched in relation to breastfeeding, psychosocial maternal characteristics are less understood but could be important predictors of breastfeeding initiation and duration. Objective: This study examined primiparous maternal psychosocial characteristics and temperamentally based negative infant affect as predictors of breastfeeding initiation and duration while accounting for depression and sociodemographic covariates. Methods: Prenatally, 237 primiparous women were administered the Adult Attachment Interview and completed a measure of beliefs related to infant crying. At 6 months postpartum, negative infant affect was assessed via mother report. Breastfeeding was assessed at 6 months and 1 year postpartum via mother report. Results: Results indicated that younger, low income, less educated, single, ethnic minority mothers and mothers with elevated depressive symptoms were less likely to initiate breastfeeding and breastfed for a shorter period than other women. Women who initiated breastfeeding tended to have higher adult attachment coherence scores (more secure attachment) than those who did not initiate breastfeeding (median score of 6.00 vs 4.00). An interaction was observed etween negative infant affect and beliefs about crying related to spoiling, such that earlier cessation of breastfeeding was observed among mothers who reported high levels of negative infant affect and strongly endorsed the belief that responding to cries spoils infants (hazard ratio = 1.71, P <.01) . Conclusion: Although these psychosocial variables predicted relatively little variation in breastfeeding over and above covariates, the results suggest some novel approaches to promote breastfeeding. ¬© The Author(s) 2014.","Mathews, M.

1277,The Sleep and Settle Questionnaire for parents of infants: Psychometric properties,"Objective: To determine the psychometric properties of a parent-report questionnaire (Sleep and Settle Questionnaire (SSQ)) assessing: (i) the infant's sleep and settling behaviour, and (ii) the parent's level of concern with such behaviours. Methodology: Test-retest reliability was determined by administering the SSQ to 20 mothers on two occasions, 7-14 days apart. Validity was determined by comparing SSQ responses between mothers with 6-week-old infants who, on a semi-structured questionnaire, reported no sleep or settling difficulties (n = 56-60) with those who reported they were experiencing difficulties (n = 133). Further comparison was made with a sample of mothers (n = 34-36) attending a community class on sleep and settling difficulties with infants. Sensitivity to change was determined by comparing mothers' SSQ responses at 6-weeks and 6-months postpartum. Results: The SSQ was found to have low test-retest reliability on items referring to the infants' sleep and settling behaviour, but moderate reliability for the extent that such behaviour bothered the parent. Comparison across the different samples showed good discriminant and concurrent validity. Conclusions: Parental reports on the SSQ indicates that over a short period (1-2 weeks) the infants' sleep and settling behaviour can change considerably, but that the extent to which such behaviour bothers the parent is more stable. Good validity demonstrates the SSQ is sensitive to differing infant behaviour. It is recommended as both a clinical and research instrument, and could be used to complement assessments focusing on the parent's psychosocial adjustment in the early postpartum period.","Matthey, S.",0,1021
1280,Assessment of stress in mothers of children with severe breath-holding spells,"BACKGROUND: Severe breath-holding spells (BHS) in children consist of a stereotypical sequence of provocation to cry, noiseless expiration, color change, and loss of consciousness. Parenting a child who exhibits BHS is likely more stressful than parenting a healthy child, owing to this additional medical concern. It is also likely more stressful than parenting a child with a convulsive seizure disorder (SD), because it is often not recognized or misdiagnosed as behavioral rather than medical. Mothers of children with BHS were hypothesized to suffer significantly greater stress than mothers of children with SD or mothers of children without any significant medical conditions. OBJECTIVES: To examine maternal stress in parenting a child who exhibits BHS, and to identify the specific areas of stress impact, compared with mothers of children with a convulsive SD and mothers of control children. METHODS: The Parenting Stress Index and questions regarding how mothers coped were individually administered to 34 mothers of children with BHS, 16 mothers of children with SD, and 16 mothers of children with no medical conditions (controls). RESULTS: Mothers of children with BHS or SD experience more overall stress and disruption in their attachment or understanding of their child, compared with control mothers. These groups of mothers (BHS and SD) also perceived their child as more distractible/hyperactive, less adaptive, and more demanding than did control mothers. However, mothers of the BHS group alone showed significant disruption in their sense of competence as a parent, maintaining self-identity, and receiving positive reinforcement from their child. Mothers of children with SD showed a similar trend, but it was not significant. These findings were not related to maternal health or feelings of depression/isolation, insufficient spousal support, child's mood, or other life stresses. CONCLUSION: Parenting a child with BHS or SD impacts a greater degree of life stress on mothers of these children than does parenting control children, although the stress is greater for the BHS group than for the SD group.","Mattie-Luksic, M. and Javornisky, G. and DiMario, F.

1283,Relation of prematurity and brain injury to crying behavior in infancy,"OBJECTIVES. The objective of this study was to assess crying behavior during infancy in very preterm infants with or without brain injury. METHODS. A total of 125 very low birth weight infants survived during January 2001 to July 2004 in Turku University Hospital, Finland. They were categorized according to the most pathologic brain finding either in ultrasound or MRI. Baby Day Diary was used to assess crying behavior at term, 6 weeks, and 5 months of corrected age. The behavior of a group of term control infants (n = 49) was assessed at 5 months. RESULTS. Severe brain injuries in very low birth weight infants did not affect the duration of fussing or crying. In very low birth weight infants, brain injuries did not affect the frequency of fussing or crying bouts or the development of circadian rhythm in crying behavior. At 5 months of corrected age, fussing bouts were more frequent in very low birth weight infants compared with term control infants (6.4 per day vs 4.5 per day), and very low birth weight infants were held more (169 minutes [97] vs 130 minutes [69], respectively). CONCLUSIONS. This prospective study using a validated cry diary showed that brain injuries that are related to prematurity do not have major effects on crying behavior or development of circadian rhythm. Prematurity does not increase the duration but increases the frequency of fussing and crying at 5 months of corrected age compared with term control infants. It also seems that prematurity and brain pathology may increase caregiving activity in the form of holding.

Parents often find children's sleep difficulties to be very challenging, but factors such as the influence of Western approaches to infant care, stress, and sensitivity have not been analyzed in terms of ICBC. A sample of 586 parents completed a questionnaire to investigate the relationships between parental factors and the method of ICBC. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Latent variables were used to measure parental stress (Parental Stress Scale","Maute, M. and Perren, S.",1,1026
1287,Causes and consequences of pedestrian injuries in children,"Pedestrian-car collisions are in motorised countries one of the leading causes of unintentional-injury-related death and morbidity among children. The objective of this study was to assess correlations between the mode and the severity or post-traumatic sequels of the injury. A 12-year (1989-2001) retrospective study of children aged 0-16 years injured in pedestrian-motor-vehicle collisions was undertaken. An anonymous survey with questionnaires completed by families was conducted. In this time period, 501 children (average age: 7.9 years) were injured. The lack of visibility of the vehicle (45%) and/or the pedestrian (39%) was the leading cause of injury. The mean injury severity score was 6.0 (1-75) and the mortality rate was 0.8% (n = 4, injury severity scores 47, 75, 75, 75). In this study, 217 questionnaires were analysed. When the children were injured, 37% of them were alone, 32.3% were in the presence of accompanying adults, and 24.0% were in the presence of other children. The latter group suffered the highest injury severity score (P = 0.016). Positive correlations were noted between injury severity score and impact speed (r = 0.31, P < 0.001) and the distances that the children were thrown off or transported on the vehicle front (r = 0.29, P < 0.001). Physical sequels were reported by 27% of the families, and 23% noted psychological disturbances. A positive correlation was noted between impact speed and the occurrence of physical sequels (P < 0.001). The number of deformed parts per vehicle was correlated to the occurrence of behavioural disturbances (P < 0.004). Conclusion: The incidence of post-traumatic sequels seems to be associated with higher speed at impact, lack of braking attempts, and higher numbers of vehicle parts deformed.","Mayr, J.

1288,Heart rate variability responses of a preterm infant to Kangaroo care,"Objective: To examine the effect of kangaroo care on heart rate variability in a healthy preterm infant. Design: Case study. Setting: Private room on a postpartum unit. Participant: A mother-preterm infant dyad. Intervention: Kangaroo (skin-to-skin) care. Main Outcome Measure: Heart rate variability, a noninvasive measurement of the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the autonomic nervous system's influence on heart rate. Results: Heart rate variability, especially the parasymp athetic component, was high when the infant was fussy in the open crib, indicating increased autonomic nervous system activity. With kangaroo care, the infant fell asleep, and both sympathetic and parasympathetic components of heart rate variability decreased. Conclusions: The wide f luctuations in the parasympathetic component of heart rate variability suggest immaturity of the sympathovagal response. Overall, kangaroo care produced changes in heart rate variability that illustrate decreasing stress.","McCain, G. C. and Ludington-Hoe, S. M. and Swinth, J. Y. and Hadeed, A. J.",0,1028

Most Ss thought infants felt pain with the same intensity as adults and were comfortable giving narcotic and nonnarcotic pain medications. The most frequently identified IP cues were crying, irritability, and inability to be consoled. Data indicate that associations exist between greater numbers of pain cues and higher pain severity ratings and between postlicensure education about pain and number of strategies to relieve pain.

It is unclear whether intervention programs designed to prevent the disabilities in preterm children are efficacious. This paper reviews the settings in which interventions take place (e.g. nursery, home) and to whom they are directed (e.g. infant, parent). One intervention program, the Infant Health and Development Program (IHDP) is reviewed in detail. The IHDP was a multisite randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of combining developmental and support services along with paediatric follow-up to reduce the developmental problems seen among LBW preterm infants. Results from all studies suggest that preventive developmental interventions for LBW, premature infants have thus far demonstrated only modest success. Future research endeavours should investigate the type, duration, critical age onset, and intensity of the intervention as well as which subgroups of LBW infants most benefit from such programs.","McCarton, C.

This study describes the development and validation of the Caregiver Reported Early Development Instruments (CREDI) short form, a new tool for measuring the motor, cognitive, language, social‚Äìemotional, and mental health skills of children under age three in culturally diverse settings. Results from 8022 children living in 17 low-, middle-, and high-income countries suggest that the CREDI short form is valid, reliable, and acceptable for measuring population-level ECD. Data highlight differences in CREDI scores within and across countries based on maternal education, child nutritional status, and household stimulation practices.

1293,"Pathways between maternal depression, the family environment, and child BMI z scores","Purpose: Modifiable aspects of the family environment that contribute to overweight in younger children have been identified, including parental feeding practices, child eating behaviors, and parenting practices related to eating and household routines. Maternal depression influences many of these factors, yet research examining pathways that may link maternal depression through the family environment to child weight is lacking. The current study examined parental feeding practices, child eating behaviors, and eating and household routines as potential mediators between maternal depressive symptoms and child weight at age six. The study also tested for differential effects of early versus concurrent maternal depressive symptoms. Methods: Longitudinal data on 1130 mothers and their children who participated in the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFSP II) and its Year 6 Follow-Up study were analyzed. A multi-step, multiple mediator model assessed direct and indirect relationships between early depressive symptoms (two months post-partum) and concurrent depressive symptoms with child Body Mass Index (BMI) z scores at age six. Potential mediators included parental feeding practices, child eating behaviors, and eating and household routines. Results: Higher early depressive symptoms directly explained lower child BMI z scores. Early depression also worked through concurrent depression, the child's food responsiveness, and the hours the child slept on week nights to explain higher child BMI z scores. Parental efforts to make sure the child eats enough directly predicted lower child weight but did not mediate the effects of early or concurrent maternal depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The findings suggest the need for greater attention to the relationships between maternal depression and child weight as a critical step toward developing effective obesity prevention strategies. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd","McCurdy, K. and Tovar, A. and Kaar, J.

1294,Early life conditions and rapid demographic changes in the developing world: Consequences for older adult health,"This book examines the long term consequences of improvements in life expectancy in the mid 20th century which are partly responsible for the growth of the elderly population in the developing world. Rapid demographic changes in child and infant mortality due to the reduction in and better treatment of disease were not often accompanied by parallel increases in standard of living. Lower mortality led to greater survival by those who had suffered poor early life conditions. As a consequence, the early life of these survivors may explain older adult health and in particular the projected increase in adult health disease and diabetes. Recent dietary changes may only compound such early life effects. This study presents findings from historical and survey data on nearly 147,000 older adults in 20 low-, middle- and high-income countries which suggest that the survivors of poor early life conditions born during the 1930s-1960s are susceptible to disease later in life, specifically diabetes and heart disease. As the evidence that the aging process is shaped throughout the entire life course increases, this book adds to the knowledge regarding early life events and older adult health. ¬© 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

1297,A prospective study of crying during the first year of infancy,"Mothers of 'crying' infants, who reported excessive crying before 3 months of age, together with mothers of matched controls who did not, were interviewed using the Crying Patterns Questionnaire (CPQ) at infant ages 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. By 4 months of age daily amounts of crying for both groups had fallen significantly. 'Crying' group infants were reported to cry significantly more than controls for the whole of their first year. Both groups cried somewhat less at 12 months than at 4 months, although these age differences were found to be statistically non-significant. The pattern of infant crying across the day was also analysed and found to be similar for both groups. Reported hourly crying rates increased during the afternoon and evening, with morning and night-time being the periods of least crying. Closer analysis of the pattern of crying across the day suggested that further investigation of crying peaks within the afternoon and evening may be worthwhile. Overall, the study suggests that after the first 3 months, the mean amount of infant crying tends to persist across the rest of the first year of life.","McGlaughlin, A. and Grayson, A.",1,1035

Grayson (1999) could be replicated. Mothers who attended child health clinics with their infants (aged up to 12 mo) were interviewed using a revised version of the Crying Patterns Questionnaire. This asks about mothers' perceptions of the amount their infant cries at 6 different periods of the day. The sample of 297 mothers was divided into 4 groups, according to the age of their infants (1‚Äì3 mo, 4‚Äì6 mo, 7‚Äì9 mo, 10‚Äì12 mo). In this way patterns of perceived daily crying across the 1st year of life were identified. The findings reported in this paper lend strong support to those of St James-Roberts and Ralil and confirm the conclusion of McGlaughlin and Grayson that perceived time of day crying peaks are concentrated in the later part of the afternoon and early part of the evening.

1299,"An alternative to ""brutacaine"": a comparison of low dose intramuscular ketamine with intranasal midazolam in children before suturing","OBJECTIVE: To compare the use of low dose intramuscular ketamine with high dose intranasal midazolam in children before suturing. METHODS: Altogether 102 children with simple wounds between 1 and 7 years old were allocated to the two study groups. RESULTS: Two children were excluded from the study because of deviation from the agreed protocol. The 50 children in the ketamine group were less likely to cry or need to be restrained during the procedure than those in the midazolam group (p < 0.01). The median oxygen saturation was 97% in both groups. There was no difference in the recovery behaviour and the range of time at which children were ready for discharge, although the median time for the latter was shorter in the midazolam group (75 v 82 minutes). Vomiting occurred in nine of the ketamine and four of the midazolam group. After discharge both groups had an unsteady gait (73% v 71%) which usually resolved within two hours. CONCLUSION: Intranasal midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) effectively sedated the children in that none could remember the suturing. However a significant number still had to be restrained (86% v 14%). Intramuscular ketamine (2.5 mg/kg) produced dissociative anaesthesia in the majority of cases and was the preferred drug of nurse, doctor, and parent.","McGlone, R.

1300,Determinants of maternal self‚Äêesteem in the neonatal period,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether maternal perceptions of infant health and behavior made a unique contribution in understanding maternal self‚Äêesteem beyond what could be achieved from objective measures. The Perception of Infant Health (POIH) questionnaire and the Bates ICQ captured the perception of infant health and temperament. Standard medical variables including the Hobel Medical Risk Summary measured the objective aspect of infant health. The Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment (NBAS) measured objective infant behavior. The Maternal Self‚ÄêReport Inventory measured self‚Äêesteem. Eighty mother‚Äêinfant dyads, which included healthy, middle socioeconomic class mothers of both full‚Äêterm, neurologically normal and preterm infants with a range of medical problems were studied. Negative maternal perceptions of infant health and behavior as well as poorer objective health status were associated with decreased maternal self‚Äêesteem. Perceptual variables of temperament and health made a unique contribution to maternal self‚Äêesteem scores. Regression analysis indicated fussy/difficult, POIH, and NBAS autonomic scores explained a significant amount of variance in maternal self‚Äêesteem.

The purpose of the current study is to examine the associations between ACEs experienced in infancy and toddlerhood and adaptive behavior and academic status in middle childhood. We used data collected from a sample of low-income families during the impacts study of Early Head Start (EHS). Data were collected by trained interviewers demonstrating at least 85% reliability with protocols. Data come from 1469 socio-demographically diverse mothers and children collected at or near ages 1, 2, 3, and 11. At ages 1, 2, and 3, an EHS-ACEs index was created based on interview and observation items. The EHS-ACEs indices were averaged to represent exposure across infancy and toddlerhood. At age 11, parents were asked about school outcomes and completed the Child Behavior Checklist. Across development, children were exposed to zero (19%), one (31%), two (27%), and three or more ACEs (23%). Logistic regression analyses, controlling for EHS program assignment, and parent, school, and child characteristics, showed ACEs were significantly associated with parental report of the child: having an individualized educational program since starting school and in the current school year, having been retained a grade in school, and problems with externalizing and internalizing behavior, as well as attention. Findings suggest that ACEs influence children's behavioral and academic outcomes early in development. ¬© 2018 Elsevier Ltd","McKelvey, L. M. and Edge, N. C. and Mesman, G.

1303,Troublesome crying in infants: effect of advice to reduce stimulation,"The observation that babies with troublesome crying improve quickly in hospital suggested that, if true, a common, quickly reversible, factor may operate. Histories from parents of such babies suggest that much work goes into trying to console them. It is hypothesised that this may lead to excessive stimulation and the improvement seen in hospital reflects a reduction in stimulation. Two studies were undertaken. (1) Carers were asked to agree to randomisation of their infants to hospital or home management. Those at home were advised to reduce stimulation. A 10 point questionnaire was used to describe distress in mothers of subjects and age matched controls. (2) A randomised controlled study compared advice to reduce stimulation with an empathic interview using a +5 to -5 scale to chart change. In the first study too few subjects agreed to randomisation and thus a rigorous study to validate the observation could not proceed. There was good evidence, however, that crying improved. Results from the home group justified the second study. The median distress score for subjects was 7/10 and for controls 3/10 (p less than 0.001). In the second study at seven days, 18/22 subjects given advice scored +2 or better on the change chart for crying, compared with 7/20 of those who did not receive advice (p less than 0.01). After the latter received advice 79% improved (95% confidence interval 61 to 97%). For babies under 12 weeks, the customary upper limit for a diagnosis of colic, 14/15 subjects advised improved compared with 6/12 who were not advised (p less than 0.02). These studies have shown that infants with troublesome crying admitted to hospital seem to improve quickly as do those whose carers are advised to reduce stimulation.","McKenzie, S.",0,1040
1304,Fifteen-minute consultation: Troublesome crying in infancy,"There is much written in the medical and lay literature about managing babies who cry too much. Healthcare professional often feel bewildered about how to go about trying to help a baby and their carer, usually the mother. They often undertake investigations, prescribe medication or alter the baby's diet. The assumption made by this approach is that the crying reflects pain or discomfort. In a normal infant who is growing well, it is rare to be able to identify any quickly treatable medical underlying disorder. Those who are inexperienced may find the idea of a behavioural approach very challenging but perhaps this would be a better alternative.","McKenzie, S. A.",0,1041
1305,Is cow's milk protein intolerance a cause of gastro‚Äêoesophageal reflux in infancy?,"To test the hypothesis that cow's milk protein intolerance (CMPI) might cause or contribute to gastro‚Äêoesophageal reflux (GOR), 10 of 14 infants with abnormal GOR on prolonged oesophageal pH monitoring who had failed to respond to conventional antireflux therapy were placed on a hypo‚Äêallergenic diet for 1 month. In no child was there significant improvement in pH monitoring indices, and only two showed any symptomatic improvement. Therefore, in these children, CMPI did not appear to contribute to GOR. It is probable that CMPI is rare as a cause of passive GOR, although our results do not exclude CMPI as a cause of active vomiting. Copyright ¬© 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

A cohort of 490 women was surveyed at intervals during pregnancy and after giving birth. Data were collected on breastfeeding outcomes and experiences and analyzed using multiple logistic regression. After controlling for sociodemographic variables, women were less likely to be still fully breastfeeding at 6 to 10 weeks postpartum if they believed they needed more breastfeeding information prior to delivery or had experienced breastfeeding problems. Women were less likely to be fully breastfeeding at 4 months postpartum if they had experienced breastfeeding problems. This prospective study demonstrated the influence ofwomen‚Äôs preparedness for breastfeeding and their experiences in establishing breastfeeding on breastfeeding duration. Improvements in prenatal education about breastfeeding and management of breastfeeding problems are likely to increase breastfeeding duration. ¬© 2003, Sage Publications.

A cross-sectional study of Australian mother-infant dyads from the NOURISH randomised controlled trial,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between temperament in Australian infants aged 2-7. months and feeding practices of their first-time mothers (n=698). Associations between feeding practices and beliefs (Infant Feeding Questionnaire) and infant temperament (easy-difficult continuous scale from the Short Temperament Scale for Infants) were tested using linear and binary logistic regression models adjusted for a comprehensive range of covariates. Mothers of infants with a more difficult temperament reported a lower awareness of infant cues, were more likely to use food to calm and reported high concern about overweight and underweight. The covariate maternal depression score largely mirrored these associations. Infant temperament may be an important variable to consider in future research on the prevention of childhood obesity. In practice, mothers of temperamentally difficult infants may need targeted feeding advice to minimise the adoption of undesirable feeding practices. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","McMeekin, S. and Jansen, E. and Mallan, K. and Nicholson, J. and Magarey, A. and Daniels, L.",0,1044

This study aimed to determine the knowledge and practice of the neonatal nurses in pain assessment and management. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 120 neonatal nurses working in the Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) and neonatal units in Ardebil, Iran, using the census method. For data collection, Nurses' Perceptions of Neonatal Pain questionnaire developed by Cong was employed, which includes two open ended and 36 Likert scale questions. The collected data were analyzed, using descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage) and qualitative content analysis method. Results: As the results of the study indicated, the nurses had adequate level of knowledge about the neonatal pain. However, less than 50% of them believed receiving suitable training on this issue. The majority of the participants reported that they did not use any pain assessment tools (65%). Less than half of them expressed that the pain assessment tools used in their units were accurate measures (44.2%). Likewise, less than half of the nurses reported that pain was well managed in their institution (28.3%) with evidence-based protocols (34.2%). In addition, more than half of the subjects reported that parents should be involved with the care and comfort of their infants during the painful procedures (71.6%). Conclusion: Nurses' perceptions of well-managed pain had a significant relationship with adequate training, use of appropriate and accurate pain tools, clear and evidence-based protocols, and parent involvement. ¬© 2016, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

1315,Fear of clowns in hospitalized children: prospective experience,"Medical clowns (MC) have become an integral part of the pediatric staff of hospital wards. While several studies have demonstrated the huge benefits of MC, there are almost no data regarding fear of clowns, a known phenomenon that means an irrational fear of clowns. In the current study, we sought to examine the prevalence of fear of clowns in pediatrics wards, and to characterize the affected children. The clinical work of three certified MCs was prospectively assessed. Every child with fear of clowns was noted, data were retrieved from the medical records, and the parents/child completed a specific questionnaire with a research assistant. Fear of clowns was defined as crying, anxiety response or effort to avoid contact with the MCs in small children, while in older children, it was determined if the child either reported fear of MCs or made actions to avoid clowns' intervention. A total of 1160 children participated in the study. All were hospitalized in the department of pediatrics or the pediatric emergency medicine department at Carmel Medical Center, and were exposed to a MC intervention session. Of the 1160 children, 14 children experienced fear of clowns (1.2%). The average age of children who experienced fear of clowns was 3.5¬†years (range 1-15). Interestingly, most of the children demonstrating fear of clowns were girls (12 out of 14, 85.7%). We found no association between fear of clowns and specific diagnosis, fever, clinical appearance, religion, or ethnicity. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of fear of clowns in the general pediatric hospitalized population was 1.2%, with a significant predominance of girls (85.7%). Children who experienced significant fear of clowns also experienced significant fear of encountering or thinking about a MC visit. Fear of clowns can affect children at any age (range 1-15), any ethnicity, religion, or degree of illness. Further large scale studies are required to better understand this unique phenomenon of fear of clowns. What is Known: ‚Ä¢ Fear of clowns is a phenomenon known for more than several decades and related to the increased use of clowns as negative characters in horror movies and TV shows. ‚Ä¢ The increased use of medical clowns in hospital wards and corridors increases the significance of defining and characterizing this phenomenon in hospital wards. What is New: ‚Ä¢ The study is novel by giving new data related to the extent of fear of clowns in pediatrics wards and giving demographic characteristic of children experiencing fear of clowns.","Meiri, N. and Schnapp, Z. and Ankri, A. and Nahmias, I. and Raviv, A. and Sagi, O. and Hamad Saied, M. and Konopnicki, M. and Pillar, G.",0,1050

1317,Signs and symptoms associated with primary tooth eruption: a clinical trial of nonpharmacological remedies,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate disturbances in primary tooth eruption and their management with nonpharmacological remedies. METHODS: In this nonrandomized clinical trial, 270 children aged between 8 and 36 months were selected and divided into 5 groups with 54 children initially enrolled in each group. The children were seen during an 8-day period during tooth eruption. At each appointment data were recorded from oral examination, tympanic temperature measurement and a questionnaire. The five methods used as remedies to reduce teething symptoms were: 1) cuddle therapy, 2) ice, 3) rubbing the gums, 4) teething rings and 5) food for chewing. Teething symptoms, the type of erupted tooth, symptoms of recovery and the mother's satisfaction with treatment were evaluated. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty four children (mean age 16 ¬± 7.2 months) completed the study. The most frequent teething symptoms were drooling (92%), sleep disturbances (82.3%) and irritability (75.6%). These symptoms were more pronounced in low birth weight children (p > 0.05). Canine eruption led to more loss of appetite than incisor (p = 0.033) or molars eruption (p = 0.014). Low grade increases in body temperature were observed only on the day of eruption (36.70 ¬± 0.39 ¬∞C), when body temperature was significantly different compared to the day before and the day after eruption (both p < 0.001). There was no significant correlation between fever as reported by mothers and temperature readings obtained by the investigators. The most favorable results for time to recovery and the mother's satisfaction were seen when teething rings were used, followed by cuddle therapy and rubbing the gums. CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between teething and symptoms such as fever or diarrhea. Low birth weight children may have more teething symptoms. Teething rings, cuddle therapy and rubbing the gums were the most effective methods to reduce symptoms.

1321,How mothers perceive infants with unspecific gastrointestinal symptoms suggestive of cow's milk allergy?,"Aim: To determine whether specific infant behavioural characteristics are present in children suspected of cow's milk allergy because of gastrointestinal symptoms. Methods: We prospectively recruited 57 children (median age 8.7 months) with a suspicion of gastrointestinally manifested cow's milk protein allergy (GI-CMPA). None had detectable cow's milk-specific IgE. Mothers were asked to complete the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) Child Domain, and those with children below 18 months of age (n = 49) also the Infant Temperament Questionnaire (ITQ). GI-CMPA was diagnosed with the double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge. Control group (n = 22) consisted of patients (age range 4-26 months), attending the Pediatric Allergy Unit, who did not have diagnosed or suspected food allergies. Results: The scores were significantly higher for the PSI (n = 48) Child Domain (p < 0.0001) and for the ITQ (n = 44) subscale Difficultness (p = 0.0045) compared with the control patients without suspected/diagnosed food allergy. The difference between the challenge positive (n = 18) and negative (n = 39) patients remained statistically insignificant. After 6 months, in both groups, the scores (PSI Child Domain p = 0.0004, ITQ Difficultness p = 0.0393) were lower, but the ITQ Difficultness score still remained higher than in the controls (p = 0.0453). Conclusion: The mothers often perceive infants with unspecific symptoms suggestive of GI-CMPA as demanding and temperamentally difficult. ¬©2014 Foundation Acta P√¶diatrica.

1323,The many faces of the Still-Face Paradigm: A review and meta-analysis,"The Still-Face Paradigm (SFP) designed by Tronick, Als, Adamson, Wise, and Brazelton (Tronick, E., Als, H., Adamson, L., Wise, S., & Brazelton, T. B. (1978). Infants response to entrapment between contradictory messages in face-to-face interaction. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 17, 1-13) has been used for many different purposes in over 80 empirical studies. In the current paper, the nature and correlates of infant behavior in the SFP were examined in a systematic narrative review and a series of meta-analyses. The results of the meta-analyses confirmed the classic still-face effect of reduced positive affect and gaze, and increased negative affect, as well as a partial carry-over effect into the reunion episode consisting of lower positive and higher negative affect compared to baseline. The still-face effect is very robust as it was found regardless of most sample variations such as infant gender and risk status, and regardless of most procedural variations, such as the length of the SFP episodes and the use of intervals between episodes. The few moderator effects that were found in the meta-analyses tended to put findings from the narrative review in a new perspective. Additional meta-analyses confirmed the narrative review in finding that higher maternal sensitivity predicted more infant positive affect during the still-face. Infants' higher positive affect and lower negative affect during the still-face were predictive of secure attachment at age 1 year. The meta-analytic results for maternal depression were equivocal. Implications for future research include a need for studies testing the role of the adults' identity (parent versus stranger, mother versus father) to elucidate the relationship-specificity of the still-face effect. Also, the role of maternal sensitivity and temperament as potential moderators of the still-face effect need to be examined further. On a procedural level, the effects of the timing of the still-face and of the duration of the reunion on infant responses deserve future research attention. ¬© 2009 Elsevier Inc.

1325,Infant smiling dynamics and perceived positive emotion,"To better understand early positive emotional expression, automated software measurements of facial action were supplemented with anatomically based manual coding. These convergent measurements were used to describe the dynamics of infant smiling and predict perceived positive emotional intensity. Over the course of infant smiles, degree of smile strength varied with degree of eye constriction (cheek raising, the Duchenne marker), which varied with degree of mouth opening. In a series of three rating studies, automated measurements of smile strength and mouth opening predicted na√Øve (undergraduate) observers' continuous ratings of video clips of smile sequences, as well as na√Øve and experienced (parent) ratings of positive emotion in still images from the sequences. An a priori measure of smile intensity combining anatomically based manual coding of both smile strength and mouth opening predicted positive emotion ratings of the still images. The findings indicate the potential of automated and fine-grained manual measurements of facial actions to describe the course of emotional expressions over time and to predict perceptions of emotional intensity. ¬© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Messinger, D.

1326,Pain Management with ROP Position in Turkish Preterm Infants During Eye Examinations: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of infant positioning on pain, heart rate, oxygen saturation and crying time during examination. DESIGN & METHODS: The randomized controlled experimental study was carried out on 70 preterm infants. ROP position‚ÄØ+‚ÄØpacifier was used in the experimental group (n‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ35) while only the pacifier was used in the control group. Heart rates, oxygen saturation, crying duration and pain score (Premature Infant Pain Profile-PIPP) were evaluated before, during and after the screening. RESULTS: The preterm infants in the experimental group recorded lower pain scores at the beginning of the screening (p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.01), at the end of the screening (p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.01) and after screening (p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.01) than those in the control group. The heart rate was higher in the control group during screening (p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.010) and after screening (p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.008) than in the preterm infants in the experimental group. Oxygen saturation was not significantly different between the groups before, during or after screening. Crying duration was lower in the experimental group than in the control group (p‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Positioning of the infant to support behavioral organization was found to be effective in reducing pain and shortening crying time during eye examination, and had favorable effects on physiological variables with ROP position during eye examinations. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: ROP position is a practical and effective non-pharmacological method during eye examinations by neonatal nurses.","Metre≈ü, √ñ and Yƒ±ldƒ±z, S.",0,1059
1327,Early parental positive personality and stress: Longitudinal associations with children's sleep,"Objectives: The current study examined the influence of early parental stress and positive parent personality during infancy on sleep in middle childhood. Further, the role of positive parent personality as a buffer of the association between parental stress and sleep was considered. Methods: Participants included 381 twins and their primary caregivers who were recruited from birth records in the United States. Primary caregivers completed survey assessments via phone when twins were 12 and 30¬†months of age to assess multiple dimensions of parental stress and positive parent personality. Approximately 6¬†years later (M¬†=¬†5.78, SD¬†=¬†0.42), twins participated in an intensive assessment that included wearing actigraph watches to provide an objective measurement of sleep, while primary caregivers completed daily diaries regarding twins' sleep. Results: Positive parent personality was associated prospectively with longer actigraphy sleep duration and higher parent-reported sleep quality/daytime functioning. Parental stress was associated prospectively with greater variability in sleep duration. Positive parent personality moderated the parental stress ‚Äì sleep-timing relation, such that greater parental stress was associated with a later midpoint of the sleep period only for children with parents low on positive personality (e.g., low optimism). All other findings were non-significant. Conclusions: Findings suggest that both positive attributes and stress may influence sleep in middle childhood and that low parent positive personality may exacerbate associations between parental stress and later timing of sleep periods in children. Early interventions to promote healthy sleeping may consider focusing on decreasing parental stress and increasing parental empathy and optimism as early as infancy. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Early-life experiences, especially adversity, have been related to health outcomes among adults and children, such that negative experiences are associated with poor health outcomes. Poor sleep (e.g., short duration, poor quality) among children is associated with negative outcomes including poorer cognitive performance and higher adiposity. What does this study add? This study used a prospective design to understand relations between early parent-related factors and child sleep. Early parental stress and positive parent personality were associated with objective sleep quality. Positive parent personality during infancy may have promotive/protective influences on sleep later in childhood. ¬© 2019 The British Psychological Society","Miadich, S. A. and Doane, L.

1332,"Crying, feeding and sleeping patterns in 1 to 12‚Äêmonth‚Äêold infants","Summary The crying, feeding and sleeping patterns of 270 infants 0‚Äì12 months old were studied using a 24‚Äêhour schedule included in a questionnaire given to mothers visiting four well‚Äêbaby clinics in Finland in 1987‚Äì88. Of these infants 78 were under3, 84 were 3‚Äì5, 65 were 6‚Äì8 and 43 were over 9 months old. The results showed that the infants less than 3 months old slept on average 15‚Äì2 hours per day, whereas those over 9 months slept 13‚Äì4 hours. The sleeping periods were longer at night. Continuous night‚Äêtime sleep for at least 6 hours was noted in 35% of the infants under 3 months old and the proportion increased to 72% by the age of 9‚Äì12 months. The youngest infants were fed on average 6‚Äì7 times per day at 2‚Äê to 3‚Äêhour intervals in the daytime and at 4‚Äê to 6‚Äêhour intervals at night. The number of feedings decreased slightly with age. The average total crying time decreased from 1‚Äì6 hours per day for the youngest group to M hours for the 9‚Äì12 months old. At the time of the study, 23 mothers felt the need for help because of excessive crying or night waking. The help needed ranged from information about colic and child care, help with housework or the baby and encouragement. Of the mothers who needed help, a significantly higher proportion had a first‚Äêborn baby compared with those not in need of help. There were also significant differences in the mothers‚Äô perception of the cry and feelings towards it. Copyright ¬© 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

The cries of the cleft palate infants were compared with the crying of 75 normal babies of the same age. No change in the fundamental frequency, melody type and duration of the cries was seen in association with these anatomical defects. Two of the characteristics studied, vibrato and the 'tonal pit', occurred significantly more often in cries of the cleft palate infants than in cries of the control series.

The pain cries were recorded before the age of 8 days, 83% of the cries before 3 days of age. The cry analysis was compared with the pain cries of 75 full-term, healthy newborn infants of corresponding birth weight and gestational age. The results showed significant differences between the cries of the asphyxiated newborn and the healthy infants. The duration of the phonation was shorter, the maximum and minimum pitch of the fundamental frequency was significantly higher. Bi-phonation and vibrato occurred more often, double harmonic break and glottal roll less often. An increase in rising, falling-rising and flat types of melody was observed. Retrospectively, the cries were more abnormal if the infant was found to be neurologically damaged at t he check-up at 2-8 years.","Michelsson, K. and Sirvi√∂, P. and Wasz-H√∂ckert, O.",0,1067

A second purpose was to report the demographic profile of infants who presented for care to 16 chiropractic clinics in the United Kingdom. Methods: This observational study prospectively collected reports by mothers of their infants‚Äô demographic profiles and outcomes across several domains of infant behavior and their own mental state using the United Kingdom Infant Questionnaire. Participating registered chiropractors were recruited through the Royal College of Chiropractors annual meeting in January 2016, and 15 clinics and the Anglo-European College of Chiropractic University College teaching clinic volunteered to participate. Results: In all, 2001 mothers completed intake questionnaires and 1092 completed follow-up forms. Statistically significant (P < .05) improvements were reported across all aspects of infant behavior studied, including feeding problems, sleep issues, excessive crying, problems with supine sleep position, infant pain, restricted cervical range of motion, and time performing prone positioning. Maternal ratings of depression, anxiety, and satisfaction with motherhood also demonstrated statistically significant improvement (P < .05). In total, 82% (n = 797) reported definite improvement of their infants on a global impression of change scale. As well, 95% (n = 475) reported feeling that the care was cost-effective, and 90.9% (n = 712) rated their satisfaction 8 or higher on an 11-point scale. Minor self-limiting side effects were reported (5.8%, n = 42/727) but no adverse events. Conclusion: In this study, mothers reported that chiropractic care for their infants was effective, safe, and cost-effective.

1345,Care coordination impacts on access to care for children with special health care needs enrolled in medicaid and CHIP,"Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) often require services from multiple health care providers. This study's objective is to evaluate whether CSHCN, enrolled in Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and receiving care coordination services, experience improved access to mental and specialty health care services. Using data from the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, two separate outcomes are used to evaluate children's access to care: receipt of needed mental and specialty care and timely access to services. Using propensity score matching, CSHCN propensity for receiving care coordination services is derived and an assessment is made of care coordination's impact on the receipt of health care and whether care is delayed. Results demonstrate that care coordination is positively associated with whether a child receives the mental and specialty care that they need, regardless of whether or not that coordination is perceived to be adequate by parents. However, receiving care coordination services that parents perceive to be adequate has a larger impact on the timeliness in which care is received. This study indicates that care coordination is associated with an increased ability for CSHCN to access needed mental and specialty care. States should consider offering care coordination services that support provider communication and fulfill families' coordination needs to the CSHCN enrolled in their Medicaid and CHIP programs. ¬© 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Miller, K.",0,1075

Two visits were made to the infant's home, once to observe the infant with the mother and once with the stranger. Infants fussed and cried significantly more often with strangers and positively vocalized more with their mothers. The infants' frequency of crying with strangers was not found to be related to the stranger's immediately preceding behavior. Other variables, such as those having to do with problematic events surrounding the infant's birth and with infant temperament, were also not related to individual differences in infant crying when with strangers. One thing that might account for differences in how much infants cry with strangers was that strangers had more difficulty in consoling infants.

The conceptual model of parenting was tested to determine whether maternal perspectives mediated the relations between the parenting resources of social support, child-rearing history, and self-esteem and the child's developmental level with parenting behavior. This conceptual model was compared to alternative models using structural equation modeling. Results indicate that mothers' perspectives directly related to parenting behavior in two different contexts as well as mediated the relations between maternal resources and behavior. Maternal self-esteem also mediated the relation between social support and child-rearing history with child-centered perspectives. Results support the importance of examining child-centered perspectives as an influence on parental competence as well as the importance of examining how parenting resources interrelate with one another to impact parenting behavior. ¬© 1997 Academic Press.","Miller-Loncar, C.

At both age points, infant temperament was assessed with the Infant Behavior Questionnaire Revised (IBQ-R) and infants were presented with the same two habituation tasks that were similar in set-up and procedure but different in content. Consistent with previous German work, a two-factor solution was found at each age point indicating Surgency/Extraversion and Negative Affectivity as underlying temperament dimensions. Dropout rates in the habituation tasks ranged from 21% to 68%. Overall, only few IBQ-R subscales, especially Duration of Orienting, had an impact on dropout rate. This suggests that the relatively high dropout rates reported in infant looking time studies are not systematically related to infant temperament. However, findings also suggest that temperament might have an impact on the likelihood of dropout when a habituation task is conducted at the end of a longer test session. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Mink, D. and Henning, A. and Aschersleben, G.",0,1080
1352,Respiratory inhibition after crying and feeding hypoxemia in infants,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, risk factors and natural history of respiratory inhibition after crying (RIAC) and feeding hypoxemia. METHODS: We screened for RIAC and feeding hypoxemia among 393 infants with a gestational age ‚â•‚Äâ36 weeks using pulse oximetry. Twenty-seven infants were treated in the neonatal intensive care unit. RESULTS: RIAC and feeding hypoxemia were observed in 95 (24.2%) and 124 (31.6%) infants, respectively. RIAC correlated with feeding hypoxemia (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), grade II increased echogenicity in the ganglionic eminence (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.005), dilation of the lateral ventricle (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.044), threatened premature labor (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.033) and twin gestation (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.089). Feeding hypoxemia correlated with RIAC (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), abnormal cranial ultrasound findings (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001), maternal smoking during pregnancy (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.083), asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.012) and twin gestation (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.067). All infants recovered from RIAC in an average of 4.5 (2.0-7.0) d. Fifteen infants recovered from feeding hypoxemia, but 10 infants needed additional assistance and monitoring by nursing until the day of discharge. The day of discharge was day 8.0 (5.0-12.4). CONCLUSIONS: RIAC and feeding hypoxemia are observed among healthy infants, and these infants experience repeated events of prolonged hypoxemia.","Minowa, H. and Hirayama, K. and Tamura, R. and Mima, A. and Ikeda, Y. and Yasuhara, H. and Ebisu, R. and Ohgitani, A.",0,1081
1353,Respiratory inhibition after crying in infants,"BACKGROUND: Among full-term neonates, the authors discovered infants who showed respiratory inhibition after crying which involved a marked decrease in SpO2. The infants were found to present increased echogenicity or a cyst in a cranial region termed the ganglionic eminence, or to have a subependymal cyst. The authors prospectively examined the relationship between respiratory inhibition after crying and these changes to examine the prevention and treatment of the episode. METHODS: The authors conducted cranial ultrasonography to screen 381 full-term neonates who showed no abnormalities at birth and whose parents requested ultrasonographic screening of the head, followed by polygraphy of infants who showed increased echogenicity or a cyst in ganglionic eminence, or had a subependymal cyst. The authors similarly conducted polygraphy for 50 neonates without cranial ultrasound abnormalities","Minowa, H. and Kubo, S. and Yoshizawa, H. and Hayashi, Y. and Hayashi, T. and Yoshida, K. and Ebisu, R. and Uchida, Y. and Ohgitani, A.",0,1082
1354,Polygraphic findings of 47 cases with respiratory inhibition after crying,"OBJECTIVE: To report the polygraphic findings of infants with respiratory inhibition after crying (RIAC). METHODS: We screened for RIAC among infants with a gestational age ‚â•36 weeks using our established method with cranial ultrasonography, SpO(2) monitoring and polygraphy. RIAC is defined as central apnea that occurred immediately after crying with a decrease in SpO(2) to <60%, followed by repeated irregular respiration and apnea as the respiration gradually recovered. The subjects were infants with RIAC for whom we could study the polygraphic findings in detail. RESULTS: Forty-seven RIAC cases were included in the present analysis. The frequency of RIAC was 2.1 (1.2-7.0) times per 24‚Äâh. The maximum duration of respiratory inhibition was 78.0 (52.6-109.0) s. The maximum duration of SpO(2) <60% during RIAC was 39.0 (9.8-93.2) s. The minimum SpO(2) value during RIAC was 53.0% (42.2-58.0%). The minimum heart rate during RIAC was 103.0 (79.1-127.1) bpm.

1355,A comparative study of the effect of massage with sunflower oil or sesame oil on infants' crying and sleep times: A randomized clinical trial,"Background & Aim: Infants are very sensitive and special attention is needed to take care of their physical and mental health. Some studies showed that massage by parents can improve infants' sleep quality. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of massage with sunflower oil or sesame oil on infants' crying and sleep times. Methods & Materials: This triple-blinded clinical trial was conducted on 120 infants who were 10-15 days old, full-term, single, exclusively breastfed and with no history of hospitalization. The infants were assigned randomly into three groups of sunflower oil massage, sesame oil massage and massage with no oils. Mothers administered 15 minutes of massage to their infants twice per day (morning and afternoon) for 28 days. Times of crying and sleep were measured by a parents' information form at baseline, and at the end of the first, second, third, and fourth weeks of the study. Data were analyzed using the repeated measures ANOVA.

1357,Effectiveness of a psycho-educational intervention to prevent postpartum parental distress and enhance infant wellbeing: Study protocol of a randomized controlled trial,"Background: The first months after birth can be challenging for parents, leading to parental distress and decreased well-being. Parents with high levels of distress are found to respond less adequately and sensitively to their infant, which in turn affects infant well-being and health. The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a psycho-educational intervention to prevent postpartum parental distress and enhance the quality of caregiving and infant well-being. In contrast to other interventions, this intervention will be (1) offered already before birth, (2) offered to all parents-to-be, regardless of their risk of postpartum distress, and (3) include fathers. The proposed study examines the effectiveness of this intervention on (1) parenting distress, (2) quality of caregiving, and (3) the infant's well-being. Methods/design: In this randomized controlled trial, 128 pregnant women and their partners will be recruited through midwifery practices and general media. Women with a complicated pregnancy, current psychopathology, insufficient Dutch language proficiency and without Internet access will be excluded. Parents will be randomized to either the intervention or a waitlist control group. The intervention consists of a booklet and video (offered prenatally), a home visit at 34-36 weeks of pregnancy and a telephone call 4 weeks after birth. Information and practical tools are provided on (1) sensitive responding and making contact with the baby, (2) crying, (3) feeding, and (4) sleeping. Assessments will take place at baseline (26-34 weeks of pregnancy), during the home visit (34-36 weeks of pregnancy), and 2, 6, and 10 weeks after birth. The control group will be offered the intervention after the end of the study. The primary outcome is maternal parenting stress. Secondary outcomes are: paternal parenting stress, parental well-being, quality of caregiving, and infant well-being and health. Discussion: The goal of this study is to test the effects of a psycho-educational prenatal parenting intervention to prevent postpartum parental distress and to enhance well-being in both parents and infants. When the intervention appears effective it can be implemented broadly because of its low costs. It will make support available for a large number of parents and their children. ¬© The Author(s).","Missler, M. and Beijers, R. and Denissen, J. and van Straten, A.",0,1086
1358,A comparison of midazolam with trimeprazine as an oral premedicant for children,"The effect of oral premedication was investigated in a double-blind, randomised trial in 85 children undergoing tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. Orally administered midazolam 0.5 mg.kg-1 given 30 min pre-operatively was compared with trimeprazine 2 mg.kg-1 given 90 min pre-operatively and a placebo preparation. Compliance, sedation and ease of induction were assessed as were the duration and quality of recovery. Following premedication with midazolam none of the patients was anxious, crying or distressed on leaving the ward, compared with 2/28 in the trimeprazine group and 5/28 in the placebo group (p = 0.0007). More patients were calm and quiet on arrival in the anaesthetic room following midazolam than following trimeprazine, with both premedicant agents comparing favourably with placebo. There was no significant difference between the three groups in the time to recovery or the sedation score on discharge to the ward. Midazolam is a safe and effective oral premedicant for children.","Mitchell, V. and Grange, C. and Black, A. and Train, J.",0,1087
1359,"Dairy food, calcium and vitamin D intake in pregnancy, and wheeze and eczema in infants","The present prospective study examined the association between maternal consumption of dairy products, calcium, and vitamin D during pregnancy and the risk of wheeze and eczema in the infants aged 16-24 months. Subjects were 763 Japanese mother-child pairs. Data on maternal intake during pregnancy were assessed with a diet history questionnaire. Symptoms of wheeze and eczema were based on criteria of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. Higher maternal intake of total dairy products, milk, cheese and calcium during pregnancy was significantly related to a decreased risk of infantile wheeze, but not eczema (adjusted ORs (95% CI) between extreme quartiles were 0.45 (0.25-0.79), 0.50 (0.28-0.87), 0.51 (0.31-0.85), and 0.57 (0.32-0.99), respectively). When maternal vitamin D consumption during pregnancy was categorised into two groups using a cut-off point at the 25th percentile, children whose mothers had consumed ‚â•4.309 Œºg¬∑day-1 had a significantly reduced risk of wheeze and eczema (adjusted ORs (95% CI) were 0.64 (0.43-0.97) and 0.63 (0.41-0.98), respectively). Higher consumption of calcium and dairy foods other than yoghurt during pregnancy may reduce the risk of infantile wheeze.

1360,Early Life Pb Exposure and its Effect on Later Life Retinal Degeneration,"The study presents the longitudinal effect of early life lead exposure on retinal ischemia. Swiss albino mice were exposed to lead acetate at two different timepoints viz. postnatal day 1‚Äì20 and at 7th week of age. These mice were then followed till 10 week of age and subjected to retinal ischemia. Retinal ischemia was induced using pterygopalatine artery ligation. The effect of prior lead exposure on ischemic insult was determined using various histological and molecular parameters. Although toxic effects of Pb are well reported, but the results in this study showed not much significant effect of early life Pb exposure on later life retinal degeneration. While retinal thickness was decreased in surgery group and 7th week Pb exposed group, PND Pb exposed mice showed retinal thickness comparable to normal control. There was no difference in TUNEL positive cells in Pb exposed group when compared to surgery group. The molecular studies revealed overexpression of BDNF and GFAP in PND Pb exposed mice reflecting more injury and inflammation. The combined results revealed that Pb exposure have mild effect on overall susceptibility to retinal damage in later life. The Pb may exert its toxic effects at longer duration and thus the toxic effects may be mapped at longer timepoints. The study provides a new dimension to the already well known toxic effects of lead which needs to be further explored. J. Cell.

1362,Temperamental approach/withdrawal and food neophobia in early childhood: Concurrent and longitudinal associations,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether temperamental approach/withdrawal processes were concurrently and longitudinally associated with parent ratings and behavioral observations of food neophobia at 4.5 years of age. Additionally, maternal feeding practices were examined as potential moderators of the association between toddler temperament and food neophobia. Data were drawn from a longitudinal study following individuals (n¬†=¬†82) from infancy through early childhood. At 18 months of age, toddlers were observed in an unfamiliar laboratory setting with an experimenter and their reactions were coded. At 4.5 years of age, the children were again observed in an unfamiliar setting and were also offered three novel foods (lychee, nori, and haw jelly). The number of foods they refused to taste was used as a measure of behavioral neophobia. Finally, mothers reported on their child's food neophobia and temperament, as well as their own feeding practices. As expected, temperament was associated with concurrent measures of food neophobia at 4.5 years of age. Also, low approach children who exhibited high negative affect and low positive affect in response to novelty at 18 months of age had higher levels of food neophobia at 4.5 years of age compared to their peers. Furthermore, evidence emerged to show that these neophobic tendencies in low approach children were strengthened by a maternal pressuring feeding style. Collectively, the results of this study emphasize that children who have low levels of temperamental approach are at a heightened risk for developing food neophobia during childhood. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Moding, K.

1365,"How much does your baby cry? Expectations, patterns and perceptions of infant crying in Mexico","Background: A limited number of studies have examined infant crying patterns in less affluent societies, but none of them have been longitudinal in nature. The aim of this study was to describe reported infant crying patterns in a cohort of Mexican infants and examine how these are associated with crying-related maternal expectations, general perceptions and help-seeking behavior. Methods: Observational cohort study, 204 primiparous mothers and their infants, recruited at birth and visited in their homes at nine different time points from 1 to 24 weeks of infant age. Results: Mothers reported that their infants cried less than infants in other more affluent societies, although not less frequently. A previously reported evening clustering of crying was present, with a subtle 24-h crying peak emerging around 2 to 4 weeks. Having an expectation of an infant who will be difficult to soothe and/or an increased report of crying frequency were associated with perceptions of maternal anguish, which was associated with maternal concern and help-seeking behaviors related to crying. Conclusions: Similarities and differences were found in the crying patterns reported by mothers of Mexican infants and others previously studied. Expectations and reports of crying behavior were associated with maternal perceptions, which may have a role in reducing crying-related anguish and demand on health services. ¬© 2014 Bolet√≠n M√©dico del Hospital Infantil de M√©xico.","Mohebati, L.

1375,Influence of genetic variants associated with body mass index on eating behavior in childhood,"Objective: Childhood eating behaviors are associated with body mass index (BMI). Recent genome-wide association studies have identified many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with adult and childhood BMI. This study hypothesized that these SNPs also influence eating behavior. Methods: In a population-based prospective cohort study among 3,031 children (mean age [standard deviation]: 4.0 [0.1] years), two weighted genetic risk scores, based on 15 childhood and 97 adult BMI SNPs, and ten individual appetite- and/or satiety-related SNPs were tested for association with food fussiness, food responsiveness, enjoyment of food, satiety responsiveness, and slowness in eating. Results: The 15 SNP-based childhood BMI genetic risk score was not associated with the eating behavior subscales. The 97 SNP-based adult BMI genetic risk score was nominally associated with satiety responsiveness (Œ≤: ‚àí0.007 standard deviation, 95% confidence interval [CI] ‚àí0.013, 0.000). Of the 10 individual SNPs, rs11030104 in BDNF and rs10733682 in LMX1B were nominally associated with satiety responsiveness (Œ≤: ‚àí0.057 standard deviation, 95% CI ‚àí0.112, ‚àí0.002). Conclusions: These findings do not strongly support the hypothesis that BMI-associated SNPs also influence eating behavior at this age.

It is usually manifested as an acute abdominal pain with intense spasmodic cramping accompanied by intense crying lasting for more than 3 hours a day during at least a three days period. Accordingly, this study is aimed to investigate the effects of Fumaria on such pain in 3-16 weeks-old infants. Materials and Methods A double-blind clinical trial has been conducted on 60 newborns. The cases were selected through simple random sampling and divided into two groups, namely control and treatment group and given 2.5cc placebo or Fumaria extract. Daily symptoms were gathered and recorded via a specially designed questionnaire. Chi-squared test was used to analyze the mustered data. Results Out of the 60 cases, 50 newborns completely participated in the study. This study revealed a significant difference between the two aforementioned study groups as regards to the length and frequency of crying periods and the number of times an infant would wake up due to colic pain (P<0.05). Concerning the demographic characteristics, there was no statistically significant difference between the control and the treatment group (p>0.05) .

METHODS: Objectively measured total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and fragmentation, subjectively reported numbers of nocturnal awakenings, total nocturnal wake time, and sleep quality, and sleepiness/fatigue measured by using the fatigue visual analog scale, the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, or the Epworth Sleepiness Scale were assessed. RESULTS: We did not find differences between women who were exclusively breastfeeding, exclusively formula feeding, or using a combination of the 2 methods, with respect to the assessed parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to encourage women to breastfeed should include information about sleep. Specifically, women should be told that choosing to formula feed does not equate with improved sleep. The risks of not breastfeeding should be weighed against the cumulative lack of evidence indicating any benefit of formula feeding on maternal sleep.

Methods Mother-infant interactions were assessed in 25 2-month-old infants with cleft lip and 25 age-matched healthy infants. Self-report and behavioral observations were used to assess maternal depressive symptoms and expressions. Mothers rated infant temperament. Results Infants with cleft lip were less engaged and their mothers showed more difficulty in interaction than control group dyads. Mothers of infants with cleft lip displayed more negative affectivity, but did not report more self-rated depressive symptoms than control group mothers. No group differences were found in infant temperament. Conclusions In order to support the mother's experience and facilitate her ongoing parental role, findings highlight the importance of identifying maternal negative affectivity during early interactions, even when they seem have little awareness of their depressive symptoms. ¬© 2011 The Author.","Montirosso, R. and Fedeli, C. and Murray, L. and Morandi, F. and Brusati, R. and Perego, G.

1381,No more tears: a randomized controlled double-blind trial of Amethocaine gel vs. placebo in the management of procedural pain in neonates,"AIM: During a comparative double-blind study, the efficacy of Amethocaine local anaesthetic gel was compared with that of a placebo gel to establish their effect on the reduction of behavioural and physiological responses to pain in neonates. METHOD: Forty infants were included in the trial, 20 being randomly assigned to each group. After topical application of either Amethocaine or the placebo for 30 minutes, cannulation was performed using a 24 gauge cannula. Assessment of pain was made with the aid of four point assessment tool incorporating facial expression, cry and heart rate changes and ease of cannulation. Additional baseline data were obtained including sex, gestation, weight and previous experience of cannulation, and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). RESULTS: Good analgesic effects were demonstrated in the Amethocaine group, as there was a high level of significance (P < 0.01) in the difference in pain scores between the two groups using a Mann-Whitney U-test. There was no correlation between gestation or weight and the degree of pain experienced during painful procedures. No significant relationship was found between cannulation and the degree of pain experienced. CONCLUSION: It can, therefore, be concluded that Amethocaine gel is an effective local anaesthetic in the management of skin puncturing procedural pain in neonates, and that all infants regardless of maturity, weight or previous experiences probably experience a similar degree of pain and therefore warrant effective and appropriate analgesic intervention.","Moore, J.",0,1106
1382,Epigenetic correlates of neonatal contact in humans,"Animal models of early postnatal mother-infant interactions have highlighted the importance of tactile contact for biobehavioral outcomes via the modification of DNA methylation (DNAm). The role of normative variation in contact in early human development has yet to be explored. In an effort to translate the animal work on tactile contact to humans, we applied a naturalistic daily diary strategy to assess the link between maternal contact with infants and epigenetic signatures in children 4-5 years later, with respect to multiple levels of child-level factors, including genetic variation and infant distress. We first investigated DNAm at four candidate genes: the glucocorticoid receptor gene, nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1 (NR3C1), Œº-opioid receptor M1 (OPRM1) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR","Moore, S.

1383,Signs and symptoms associated with digestive tract development,"Objective: To analyze the development and prevalence of gastrointestinal signs and symptoms associated with the development of the digestive tract, and to assess the measures aimed to reduce their negative impacts. Source of data: Considering the scope and comprehensiveness of the subject, a systematic review of the literature was not carried out. The Medline database was used to identify references that would allow the analysis of the study topics. Synthesis of results: Infants frequently show several gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. These clinical manifestations can be part of gastrointestinal functional disorders such as infantile colic, infant regurgitation, and functional constipation. Allergy to cow's milk protein and gastroesophageal reflux disease are also causes of these clinical manifestations and represent an important and difficult differential diagnosis. The diseases that course with gastrointestinal signs and symptoms can have an impact on family dynamics and maternal emotional status, and may be associated with future problems in the child's life. Comprehensive pediatric care is essential for diagnosis and treatment. Maternal breastfeeding should always be maintained. Some special formulas can contribute to the control of clinical manifestations depending on the established diagnosis. Conclusion: During the normal development of the digestive tract, several gastrointestinal signs and symptoms may occur, usually resulting from functional gastrointestinal disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and allergy to cow's milk protein. Breastfeeding should always be maintained. ¬© 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria","Morais, M. B. D.",0,1108
1384,Pain and stress assessment after retinopathy of prematurity screening examination: indirect ophthalmoscopy versus digital retinal imaging,"BACKGROUND: Increasingly, neonatal clinics seek to minimize painful experiences and stress for premature infants. Fundoscopy performed with a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope is the reference examination technique for screening of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and it is associated with pain and stress. Wide-field digital retinal imaging is a recent technique that should be evaluated for minimizing infant pain and stress. METHODS: The purpose of the study was to assess and compare the impact of using a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope (BIO), or wide-field digital retinal imaging (WFDRI) on pain and stress in infants undergoing ROP screening examination. This was a comparative evaluation study of two screening procedures. Ophthalmologic examinations (N = 70) were performed on 24 infants with both BIO and WFDRI. Pain assessments were performed with two specific neonatal scales (Crying, requires oxygen, increased vital signs, expression and sleeplessness, CRIES and, Premature infant pain profile, PIPP) just prior to the examination, and 30 seconds, 1 hour, and 24 hours later after ending the examination. RESULTS: Changes over time were significantly different between BIO and WFDRI with both scales (PIPP score, p = .007, and CRIES score, p = .001). Median PIPP score (interquartile interval) at baseline was 4 (3-5). At 30 seconds the score was 8 (6-9) for BIO and 6 (5-7) for WFDRI, respectively. The increase in PIPP score between baseline and 30 seconds was significantly lower with WFDRI (p = .006). The median increase in CRIES score from baseline to 30 seconds was 1 point lower for WFDRI than for BIO (p < .001). No significant difference in response remained at 1 hour or 24 hour assessments. CONCLUSIONS: A transient short-term pain and stress response occurs with both BIO and WFDRI. Infants examined for screening of ROP with digital retinal imaging present less pain and stress at 30 seconds following completion of the exam when compared with binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy.","Moral-Pumarega, M.

1385,Proneness to distress and ambivalent relationships,"Mothers of preterm and full term infants completed R. Abidin's (1986) Parenting Stress Index at 8 months, E. Waters' (1995) Attachment Behavior Q-sort at 12 months, and the J. E. Bates et al (1979) Infant Characteristics Questionnaire at 18 months. These instruments provided assessments of fussy and difficult infant behaviors that were moderately stable over the 10 months. On the basis of home observations at 12 months, the infant‚Äìmother relationships were classified as secure, avoidant and ambivalent. J. Cassidy (1994) has proposed that infants in ambivalent relationships may have poor affect regulation. Consistent with Cassidy's view, mothers in ambivalent relationships reported more fussy and difficult infant behavior at each age than did mothers in secure or avoidant relationships. Mothers of preterm infants reported higher scores on the Child Domain of the Parenting Stress Index than mothers of full term infants. The birth groups did not differ on the 12- and 18-month assessments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Moran, Greg and Pederson, David R.",0,1110

Most symptoms, present in the preceding 3 days, were associated with all grades of illness. Only four symptoms were not reported in well infants: a fluid intake less than a third of normal, convulsions, frank blood in the stools, and bile-stained vomiting. By comparison, many signs were seen only in ill infants. Those associated only with moderate or serous illness were marked retraction of the lower ribs, high-pitched or moaning cry, expiratory grunt, loss of alertness, central cyanosis, and severe hypotonia. Although these will not identify all seriously ill infants, parents and professionals should be taught to recognize these important symptoms and signs of serious illness.","Morley, C.

Whether they were asleep, content, or crying was recorded and the severity of their illness graded. The diagnosis was also recorded. The mean (SD) for the respiratory rate in babies seen awake was 61 (18) breaths/minute at hospital and 61 (14) breaths/minute at home. The respiratory rate when awake did not correlate with the severity of a baby's illness or the presence of serious lower respiratory tract infections. Sleeping babies had a significantly lower mean rate than awake babies at 42 (12) breaths/minute. Crying babies had a significantly lower mean rate than awake and content babies: 51 (14) breaths/minute compared with 61 (18) breaths/minute.","Morley, C. J. and Thornton, A. J. and Fowler, M.

1390,Non-reassuring foetal status and neonatal irritability in the Japan Environment and Children's Study: A cohort study,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether non-reassuring foetal status (NRFS) affected an infant's temperament, or if the temperament formed prenatally resulted in an excessive heart rate reaction that was diagnosed as NRFS. We examined the correlation between NRFS and difficulty in holding a baby, and the amount of crying in the one month after birth, which was considered an indicator of the newborn's temperament. We divided the cases with NRFS into positive NRFS and false positive NRFS. NRFS was associated with bad mood, frequent crying for a long duration, and intense crying. After adjustment for other covariates, NRFS was associated with bad mood (odds ratio, OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.15, 95% confidence interval, CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.00-1.33), and intense crying (1.12, 1.02-1.24). In the multi-variable model, positive and false positive NRFS were not clearly associated with neonatal irritability. When stratified by parity, NRFS and false positive NRFS were likely to be positively associated with neonatal irritability in parous women. The clear association between NRFS and intense crying was observed in parous women (multi-variable adjusted OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.46, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.16-1.83), but not in nulliparae (1.01, 0.91-1.12) (p for effect modification <0.01). Similarly, increased odds of intense crying associated with false positive NRFS were only found in parous women (multi-variable adjusted OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.40, 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.09-1.81) (p for effect modification‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03).

1392,"The role of attachment security, temperament, maternal perception, and care-giving behavior in persistent infant sleeping problems","This study investigates the relationship of etiological factors to infant sleeping problems during the first year, and at follow-up during the second year of life. The relevant factors for concurrent sleeping problems (in order of importance) were problematic maternal cognition concerning setting limits on the infant, fussy-difficult infant temperament, maternal anxiety-depression, ambivalent attachment, and certain maternal care-giving behaviors involving the use of active physical comforting (cuddling to sleep, settling on sofa or in parental bed, and giving a feed). High initial levels of sleeping problems largely explained the continuity in infant sleeping problems over time. However, this continuity was significantly mediated by the influence of both problematic maternal cognition and infant temperament on the parental use of active physical comforting to settle infants to sleep. In addition, ambivalent attachment had a small but significant independent contribution to persistent problems. Regarding discontinuity in infant sleeping problems over time, infants who developed sleeping problems were those whose parents used high levels of active physical comforting, whereas those infants whose sleeping problems recovered were more likely to have mothers with low depression-anxiety. The significance of these results is discussed with respect to developmental models of infant sleeping problems, and the assessment and treatment of infant sleeping problems. ¬© 2003 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.","Morrell, J. and Steele, H.",0,1115
1393,Prevalence of Phimosis in Males of All Ages: Systematic Review,"Context: Phimosis is considered virtually universal in newborn males and likely to resolve within a few years. Persistent phimosis can result in pain, sexual dysfunctions, increased risk of penile inflammatory conditions and penile cancer. There are two forms ‚Äì primary phimosis and secondary phimosis ‚Äì the latter often representing a consequence of lichen sclerosis, diabetes and obesity. Objectives: To conduct a systematic review to determine the prevalence of phimosis at different ages. Data Sources: PubMed, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, and bibliographies of original studies were searched using the keyword phimosis. Study Selection: Studies containing original data on phimosis at any age. Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently verified study design, extracted data and rated studies for quality. Results: Forty-three eligible studies were included: 27 from PubMed, 4 from Google Scholar, and 12 from bibliography searches. Phimosis was reported in most newborns, then gradually decreased in prevalence. Most studies did not differentiate primary from secondary phimosis, so values reported were net phimosis prevalence. There were 13 studies with data for males age ‚â•18 years. In all, 962 of 17,136 men had been diagnosed with phimosis (range 0.5%‚Äì13%). A random effects model found risk of phimosis in men was 3.4% (95% CI 1.8‚Äì6.6). Conclusion: Phimosis takes many years to resolve. Apart from spontaneous resolution, clinical interventions also contribute to the gradual reduction in prevalence among uncircumcised boys. The wide range of phimosis prevalence reported in adulthood may reflect variability in the extent of foreskin-preserving treatment of phimosis in different study cohorts. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Morris, B.

1394,The emotional cost of distance: Geographic social network dispersion and post-traumatic stress among survivors of Hurricane Katrina,"Rationale Social networks offer important emotional and instrumental support following natural disasters. However, displacement may geographically disperse network members, making it difficult to provide and receive support necessary for psychological recovery after trauma. Objectives We examine the association between distance to network members and post-traumatic stress using survey data, and identify potential mechanisms underlying this association using in-depth qualitative interviews. Methods We use longitudinal, mixed-methods data from the Resilience in Survivors of Katrina (RISK) Project to capture the long-term effects of Hurricane Katrina on low-income mothers from New Orleans. Baseline surveys occurred approximately one year before the storm and follow-up surveys and in-depth interviews were conducted five years later. We use a sequential explanatory analytic design. With logistic regression, we estimate the association of geographic network dispersion with the likelihood of post-traumatic stress. With linear regressions, we estimate the association of network dispersion with the three post-traumatic stress sub-scales. Using maximal variation sampling, we use qualitative interview data to elaborate identified statistical associations. Results We find network dispersion is positively associated with the likelihood of post-traumatic stress, controlling for individual-level socio-demographic characteristics, exposure to hurricane-related trauma, perceived social support, and New Orleans residency. We identify two social-psychological mechanisms present in qualitative data: respondents with distant network members report a lack of deep belonging and a lack of mattering as they are unable to fulfill obligations to important distant ties. Conclusion Results indicate the importance of physical proximity to emotionally-intimate network ties for long-term psychological recovery. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Morris, K. A. and Deterding, N.

However, the MDA program covers only school aged children and does not include neither adult individuals nor other public health measures. The Ijinga schistosomiasis project examines the impact of an intensified treatment protocol with praziquantel MDA in combination with additional public health interventions. It aims to investigate the feasibility of eliminating intestinal schistosomiasis in a highly endemic African setting using an integrated community-based approach. In preparation of this project, we report about baseline data on S.mansoni prevalence, intensity of infection, related hepatosplenic morbidities and their associated factors. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted among 930 individuals aged 1-95 years living at Ijinga Island, north-western Tanzania in September 2016. Single stool and urine samples were collected from each study participant and processed using Kato Katz (KK) technique and point-of-care Circulating Cathodic (POC-CCA) antigen test for detection of S.mansoni eggs and antigen respectively. Ultrasonographical examination for S.mansoni hepatosplenic morbidities was done to all participants. For statistical analyses Fisher's exact test, chi-square test, student-t-test, ANOVA and linear regression were used where applicable. Results: Overall based on KK technique and POC-CCA test, 68.9% (95%CI: 65.8-71.8) and 94.5% (95%CI: 92.8-95.8) were infected with S.mansoni.

A total of 27.1, 31.2 and 51.9% of the study participants had periportal fibrosis (PPF-grade C-F), splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. Risk factors for PPF were being male (aRR = 1.08, 95%CI: 1.02-1.16, P < 0.01), belong to the age group 16-25 years (aRR = 1.23, 95%CI: 105-1.44, P < 0.01), 26-35 years (aRR = 1.42, 95%CI: 1.21-1.67, P < 0.001), 36-45 years (aRR = 1.56, 95%CI:1.31-1.84, P < 0.001) and ‚â• 46 years (aRR = 1.64, 95%CI:1.41-1.92, P < 0.001). The length of the left liver lobe was associated with being female (P < 0.03), belong to the age group 1-5 years (P < 0.013), 6-15 years (P < 0.04) and S.mansoni intensity of infection (P < 0.034). Male sex (aRR = 1.15, 95%CI:1.06-1.24, P < 0.001) and belonging to the age groups 16-25 years (aRR = 1.27, 95%CI:1.05-1.54, P < 0.02) or 26-35 years (aRR = 1.32, 95%CI:108-1.61, P < 0.01) were associated with splenomegaly. Conclusion: Schistosoma mansoni infection and its related morbidities (hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, periportal fibrosis) are common in the study area. Age, sex and intensity of infection were associated with periportal fibrosis. The prevalence of S.mansoni was above 50% in each age group and based on the observed prevalence, we recommend MDA to the entire community. ¬© 2019 The Author(s).","Mueller, A. and Fuss, A. and Ziegler, U. and Kaatano, G.

1398,The long shadow of violence: The impact of exposure to intimate partner violence in infancy and early childhood,"Early exposure to adversities, such as witnessing intimate partner violence (IPV) can have long-lasting impact on infants behavioral, emotional, and neurological development. Yet, research so far has focused on how IPV affects the well-being of women or on the retrospective effects in older children. The first 2 years of life are characterized by rapid development of brain and behavior, making infants even more vulnerable than women or older children to the detrimental effects of exposure to violence. The goal of this review is to summarize the scientific findings on the effects of IPV on infant brain maturation and related socioemotional development. We describe effects of violence on attachment, symptoms of trauma in infants, and possible pathways involved in how IPV exposure may affect maturation of brain regions related to emotional regulation. We relate affected brain structures to development of stress reactivity (amygdala), memory (hippocampus), the processing of witnessed events itself (auditory and visual cortex), and how these consequences relate to potential subsequent psychopathology. ¬© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Mueller, I. and Tronick, E.",0,1121

One pathway through which maternal mental health may influence children‚Äôs outcomes is via its effects on parenting. This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of parenting behavior in the pathway between maternal postnatal distress and later symptoms of ADHD in the child. Biological mothers living with their children participating in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children with data available from waves 1 (child age 3‚Äì12¬†months) and 5 (child age 8‚Äì9¬†years) were included in the current study (n = 3456). Postnatal distress was assessed by parent report at wave 1. Parenting warmth, hostility and consistency were assessed by parent report at wave 5. ADHD status at wave 5 was ascertained by parent report of the child having a diagnosis of ADHD/ADD or by elevated ADHD symptoms by both parent and teacher report. There was evidence of an indirect pathway from maternal postnatal distress to child ADHD at age 8‚Äì9¬†years via parenting hostility, but not through parenting warmth or consistency, even after accounting for concurrent maternal mental health. Our findings highlight the importance of early identification and intervention for maternal postnatal distress, as treatment may prevent mothers from developing hostile parenting practices and also disrupt the pathway to ADHD in their offspring. ¬© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Mulraney, M. and Giallo, R. and Efron, D. and Brown, S. and Nicholson, J.

Methods: Two hundred healthy infants were enrolled at 2 months of age. Eight nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from enrolment until 12 months of age. Pneumococci were detected using quantitative PCR and serotyped by microarray. Regression models assessed factors influencing pneumococcal carriage and density. Results: Eighty-five percent of infants carried pneumococci at least once during the study. The median age at first acquisition was 129 days (interquartile range 41‚Äì216 days). The median duration of carriage was longer for the first pneumococcal acquisition compared with subsequent acquisitions (151 days vs. 95 days, p < 0.0001). Of the 166 infants who carried pneumococci during the study, the majority (63.9%) carried a single pneumococcal serotype at a time. Pneumococcal carriage density was higher when upper respiratory tract infection symptoms were present, lower during antibiotic usage, decreased with age, and tended to decrease over time during a carriage episode. Conclusions: The majority of Indonesian infants carry pneumococcus at least once during the first year of life. Pneumococcal carriage is a dynamic process, with pneumococcal density varying during a carriage episode. ¬© 2019 The Authors","Murad, C. and Dunne, E.

1405,Controlled trial of the short- and long-term effect of psychological treatment of post-partum depression. 2. Impact on the mother-child relationship and child outcome,"Background: Postnatal depression is associated with adverse child cognitive and socio-emotional outcome. It is not known whether psychological treatment affects the quality of the mother-child relationship and child outcome. Aims: To evaluate the effect of three psychological treatments on the mother-child relationship and child outcome. Method: Women with post-partum depression (n=193) were assigned randomly to routine primary care, non-directive counselling, cognitive-behavioural therapy or psychodynamic therapy. The women and their children were assessed at 4.5, 18 and 60 months post-partum. Results: Indications of a positive benefit were limited. All three treatments had a significant benefit on maternal reports of early difficulties in relationships with the infants","Murray, L. and Cooper, P. J. and Wilson, A. and Romaniuk, H.",0,1127
1406,"Postnatal Depression, Mother-Infant Interactions, and Child Development: Prospects for Screening and Treatment","A considerable body of evidence has accumulated concerning the development of children of postnatally depressed mothers. This shows that risks are raised in a number of areas of psychological functioning, including attachments, cognitive, and socio-emotional development. Adverse child outcomes associated with the maternal disorder are more likely to occur where maternal depression is severe and chronic. In recent years, research has begun to identify the mechanisms accounting for poor child outcome, including difficulties in the mother-child relationship associated with depression. Notably, specific inter-personal pathways can be identified to different child problems. These conclusions have significant implications for treatment. First, it is clear that treating maternal depression alone is not associated with improvements in the mother-child relationship and child outcome. Rather, interventions specifically targeting difficulties in parenting are likely to be more fruitful. Further evidence is required to develop effective treatments for parenting difficulties, and there is also a need to develop reliable, evidence-based measures that can be used in routine clinical practice to identify the different kinds of parenting problems that can occur in the context of postnatal depression. ¬© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

1408,Infant vocalization: A longitudinal study of acoustic and temporal parameters,"Investigated cry and noncry vocalizations obtained at biweekly intervals from 2 to 12 wks of life in 1 female infant to determine if longitudinal trends exist in cry and nondistress vocalizations and if certain acoustic and temporal parameters of cry are related to nondistress vocalizations. The parameters under investigation for both vocalization types were the mean and standard deviation of the fundamental frequency (F≈ì), the F≈ì range, the percentage of periodic/aperiodic phonation relative to the silent intervals, the duration of the vocalic segments, and the type of melody contour. Identification of vocal patterns characteristic of different internal stimulus conditions suggests that discriminative verbal communication develops as early as the 1st 12 wks of life. Cry and nondistress vocalization differed predominantly in the F≈ì range and melodic contours. Comparison of the data on the 2 cry types appears to reflect the differences in the physiologic/emotional state of the S. It is concluded that hunger and discomfort cries and nondistress utterances present 3 divergent phonatory profiles based on the 4 sets of acoustic analyses employed. All 3 vocalization types may be attempts to communicate","Murry, Thomas and Hoit-Dalgaard, Jeannette and Gracco, Vincent L.",0,1129
1409,Premenstrual symptoms in young adults born preterm at very low birth weight--from the Helsinki Study of Very Low Birth Weight Adults,"BACKGROUND: Clinically significant premenstrual symptoms are common among young women. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is characterized by emotional, behavioural and physical symptoms that consistently occur during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a severe form of PMS. Individual variation in stress responsiveness may be involved in the pathophysiology of premenstrual symptoms. Preterm birth at very low birth weight (VLBW, < 1500g) has a multitude of consequences that extend to adult life, including altered stress responsiveness which could affect the prevalence of premenstrual symptoms. METHODS: In this cohort study, we compared 75 VLBW women with 95 women born at term (mean age 22.5). We used a standardized retrospective questionnaire assessing the presence and severity of a variety of symptoms before and after menses. The symptom scores were used both as continuous and as dichotomized variables, with cutoffs based on DSM-IV criteria for PMDD and ACOG criteria for PMS, except prospective daily ratings could not be used. We used multiple linear and logistic regression to adjust for confounders. RESULTS: There was no difference in the continuous symptom score before menses (mean difference VLBW-term -18.3%, 95% confidence interval -37.9 to 7.5%) or after menses. The prevalence of premenstrual symptoms causing severe impairment to daily life was 13.3% for VLBW women and 14.7% for control women. For PMDD, it was 8.0% and 4.2%, and for PMS, 12.0% and 11.6%, respectively. These differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.1). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the severity of premenstrual symptoms and the prevalence of PMDD and PMS among young women born preterm at VLBW is not higher than among those born at term.","Mustaniemi, S. and Sipola-Lepp√§nen, M. and Hovi, P. and Halbreich, U. and V√§√§r√§sm√§ki, M. and R√§ikk√∂nen, K. and Pesonen, A.

Furthermore, to survey trainee paediatricians (SPRs, specialist registrars) about their self-rated confidence in assessing the MSK system. METHODS: Case notes of consecutive general paediatric medical patients admitted to three UK hospitals over a 4-week period were assessed using a standard pro forma. All patients had been assessed by a consultant paediatrician during their admission. A postal questionnaire was sent to all SPRs in training in each of the hospitals, regarding their confidence in assessing the MSK system compared with other systems and their exposure to MSK teaching. RESULTS: Case notes of 257 patients [117 females, median age 3 yr (range 1-18 yr)] were reviewed. The most common reason for admission was acute infection, although the spectrum of other recorded diagnoses varied between hospitals. Thirteen children (5%) had an acute problem (e.g. infection) against a background of chronic disease. The case note documentation showed that cardiovascular (CVS), respiratory (RS) and gastrointestinal (GI) systems were assessed in the vast majority (>90%) of patients, irrespective of the underlying diagnosis. However, other systems were less well recorded","Myers, A. and McDonagh, J. E. and Gupta, K. and Hull, R. and Barker, D. and Kay, L. J. and Foster, H. E.",0,1131

In a series of 13 3-min segments, mothers, grandmothers, and strangers were signaled to leave the room and to return. Ss' playroom behavior was examined by measuring duration of play, cry, proximity to each adult, hold by each adult, and proximity to the door. Mothers and grandmothers were treated almost interchangeably, while strangers were treated as strangers. Infants preferred their mothers when both the mother and grandmother were present.

1413,Sudden infant death syndrome temperament before death,"A retrospective study was made of the behavioral patterns of 46 infants whose deaths were attributed to the sudden infant death syndrome. Controls were the victims' siblings. Data concerning the infants' behavioral pattern were collected retrospectively from the parents, utilizing a modification of the Carey temperament questionnaire. The parents' recollection of the victims indicated that they: (1) had less intense reactions to environmental stimuli, (2) were less active physically, (3) were more breathless and exhausted during feeding, and (4) had more abnormal cries. The behavioral characteristics had a positive correlation with various postmortem evidences of antecedent chronic hypoventilation and hypoxemia. It would be a serious error for any parent to be told that their infant was at risk based on the behavioral pattern reported retrospectively by parents of victims of SIDS, because the pattern is also a common one in other infants.","Naeye, R.

1417,"Counseling on early childhood concerns: Sleep issues, thumb-sucking, picky eating, school readiness, and oral health","Family physicians are often a source of information and advice on early childhood concerns regarding sleep, thumb-sucking/pacifier use, picky eating, school readiness, and oral health. Evidence indicates that family variables are important in the genesis of sleep difficulties, and that traditional behavioral methods are not as effective as previously thought. Attention to family psychosocial well-being, especially maternal functioning, is important in addressing childhood sleep difficulties. Thumb-sucking and pacifier use may be associated with negative consequences if they persist, and referral is recommended after four years of age if appropriate behavioral interventions are ineffective. Picky eating is heavily influenced by environmental factors, and food neophobia is a normal stage of development. The main approaches to childhood eating problems include social modeling of normal eating behaviors, repeated exposures to new foods, and positive mealtime experiences. School readiness focuses on supporting the psychosocial variables that are associated with school success. Reading with the child enhances literacy skills. Quality early childhood education programs are also effective in enhancing school success. Delaying school entry is not beneficial and may be detrimental. School readiness includes the schools‚Äô role in supporting the learning needs of all children regardless of their abilities and skills. Oral health is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to overall health.

The Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study, a population-based birth cohort, ascertained multiple exposures during early life. Objective: To characterize exposure to phthalates during infancy and early childhood. Methods: Environmental questionnaires were administered, and urine samples collected at 3, 12, and 36 months. In the first 1578 children, urine was analyzed for eight phthalate metabolites: mono-methyl phthalate (MMP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-butyl phthalate (MBP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), and mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP). Geometric mean (GM) concentrations were calculated by age, together with factors that may influence concentrations. Trends with age were examined using mixed models and differences within factors examined using ANOVA. Results: The highest urinary concentration was for the metabolite MBP at all ages (GM: 15‚Äì32 ng/mL). Concentrations of all phthalate metabolites significantly increased with age ranging from GM: 0.5‚Äì15.1 ng/mL at 3 months and 1.9‚Äì32.1 ng/mL at 36 months. Concentrations of all metabolites were higher in the lowest income categories except for MEHP at 3 months, among children with any breastfeeding at 12 months, and in urine collected on dates with warmer outdoor temperatures (>17 ¬∞C), except for MBzP at 3 months and MEHP at 3 and 12 months. No consistent differences were found by gender, study site, or maternal age. Conclusions: Higher phthalate metabolite concentrations were observed among children in lower income families. Examination of factors associated with income could inform interventions aimed to reduce infant phthalate exposure. ¬© 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","Navaranjan, G. and Takaro, T.

1423,Association of Perceived Maternal Stress during the Perinatal Period with Electroencephalography Patterns in 2-Month-Old Infants,"Importance: Variation in child responses to adversity creates a clinical challenge to identify children most resilient or susceptible to later risk for disturbances in cognition and health. Advances in establishing scalable biomarkers can lead to early identification and mechanistic understanding of the association of early adversity with neurodevelopment. Objectives: To examine whether maternal reports of stress are associated with patterns in resting electroencephalography at 2 months of age and whether unique electroencephalographic profiles associated with risk and resiliency factors can be identified. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this cohort study, a population-based sample of 113 mother-infant dyads was recruited from January 1, 2016, to March 1, 2018, during regularly scheduled pediatric visits before infants were 2 months of age from 2 primary care clinics in Boston, Massachusetts, and Los Angeles, California, that predominantly serve families from low-income backgrounds.

1433,The role of food experiences during early childhood in food pleasure learning,"Infants are born equipped to ingest nutrients, but have to learn what to eat. This must occur early, because the mode of feeding evolves dramatically, from ‚Äútube‚Äù feeding in utero to eating family foods. Eating habits established during early years contribute to the development of subsequent eating habits. Therefore, it is fundamental to understand the most important early periods (between birth and 2 years, i.e. onset of food neophobia) for the development of eating habits and the drivers of this development. The role of pleasure in eating is central, especially during childhood when cognitive drivers of food choices may be less prominent than later in life. It is not easy to define and measure pleasure of eating in early childhood.

1435,Early Development of Taste and Flavor Preferences and Consequences on Eating Behavior,"The first 1,000 days of life constitute an important period for the development of health and eating behavior. While the feeding mode drastically evolves, the child learns ""how"", ""what,"" and ""how much"" food to eat. When orally exposed, infants discover food properties, with a variety of tastes, flavors, textures, as well as energy densities. Here, we focus on deciphering the involvement of taste and olfaction in the early establishment of eating behavior. In the OPALINE French birth cohort (Observatory of Food Preferences in Infants and Children), taste and flavor preferences were studied in relation to food preferences over the first 2 years. Both taste and flavor preferences evolved during this period. At weaning, a higher preference for sweet, sour, and umami tastes was associated with a higher acceptance of sweet-, sour- and umami-tasting foods, respectively. At 12 months, rejection of the odor of trimethylamine and dimethyl disulfide was related to the rejection of fish and sulfurous cheeses, respectively. Further, at 20 months, food neophobia was associated with odor but not taste differential reactivity, revealing the importance of olfaction in neophobic reactions. Further studies are ongoing to examine the long-term effect of early taste and flavor exposure on food preferences. ¬© 2019 Nestl√© Nutrition Institute, Switzerland/S.

1437,Clinical manifestations of campylobacter concisus infection in children,"BACKGROUND: There is only sparse information about the clinical impact of Campylobacter concisus infections in children. METHODS: A study was performed during a 2-year period to determine the clinical manifestations in C. concisus-positive children with gastroenteritis. A case patient was defined as a child or teenager (<18 years) with a C. concisus-positive stool sample during the study period. Clinical data were obtained with use of a questionnaire study supplemented with the patients' medical records. The clinical manifestations in these patients were compared with those of patients with Campylobacter jejuni/coli infection. RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred seventy-two diarrheic stool samples from 1867 children were cultured for pathogenic enteric bacteria during the study period, and 85 and 109 children with C. concisus and C. jejuni/coli, respectively, were identified. Comparison of the acute clinical manifestations in 44 C. concisus patients with those in 64 C. jejuni/coli patients showed a significantly lower prevalence of fever, chills and blood in stools in the former. However, half of C. concisus patients compared with one-fourth of C. jejuni/coli patients had prolonged diarrhea for more than 2 weeks and two-thirds of all children with C. concisus reported loose stools after 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: C. concisus infection in children seems to have a milder course of acute gastroenteritis compared with C. jejuni/coli infection but is associated with more prolonged diarrhea. Children with C. concisus have the same degree of late gastrointestinal complaints as children diagnosed with C. jejuni/coli infection.

1439,Infant temperament and perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms in Mexican women,"Aim: This study explores the association between infant temperament at six months postpartum and pre- and postpartum depressive and anxiety symptoms. The association between infant temperament and stressful life events is also evaluated. Method: A total of 210 Mexican women were assessed during pregnancy (gestational age 32.39 ¬± 4.01) and at six months postpartum. The instruments used were: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Anxiety Subscale of the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (SCL-90R), a short form of Stressful Life Events and The Infant Characteristics Questionnaire, when infants were six months old. Results: Although a mother's emotional state during pregnancy (depressive and anxiety symptoms and stressful life events) was not associated with difficult infant temperament, it was associated with depressive and anxious symptomatology during the postpartum period. Mothers with prenatal depressive symptoms who remained depressed and mothers who only had depression symptoms during the postpartum period reported having more difficult infants. Likewise, mothers with prenatal anxiety symptoms who maintained anxiety symptoms postpartum and mothers with anxiety symptoms during the postpartum period alone reported having more difficult infants. Comorbidity was found between depressive and anxious postnatal symptomatology in its association with difficult infant temperament. Conclusion: In this study, postpartum depressive and anxiety symptoms played an important role in shaping difficult infant temperament. Comorbidity between the two conditions warrants clinical attention and additional research, since it is related to maternal perception of difficult infant temperament. Psychological interventions are required, since these women may require assistance with emotional adaptation in the transition to motherhood. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Nieto, L. and Lara, M.

1440,Breastfeeding difficulty and pacifier use,"Research about pacifiers used in the healthy, term infant shows that they are associated with shortened breastfeeding duration, acute otitis media, and may be a marker for breastfeeding difficulty. This case study describes a situation where latch was faulty from the beginning, and a pacifier was introduced when the thriving baby was two and a half weeks old. The baby's average number of daily feeds dropped from 14 breastfeeds a day to nine breastfeeds. The baby's rate of weight gain dropped from 1135 g (2 lb 7 oz) gain in the first 16 days of life, down to a gain of 180 g (6 oz) over the next 15 days. The baby's fussiness and the mother's nipple soreness disappeared after a lactation consultant helped the mother to correct the latch and stop using the pacifier. While it is not possible to say that the pacifier caused slower weight gain, less frequent breastfeeds or nipple soreness, it would seem to be implicated in the changes.","Nikki, L.",0,1150
1441,Preventing sleeping problems in infants who are at risk of developing them,"Aims: (1) To identify factors at 1 week of age which put infants at risk of failing to sleep through the night at 12 weeks of age. (2) To assess whether a behavioural programme increases the likelihood that these infants will sleep through the night at 12 weeks of age. Methods: A community sample of 316 newborn infants was employed to identify the risk factors at 1 week of age which increased the likelihood of failing to sleep through the night at 12 weeks of age. Infants who met these risk criteria and were randomly assigned to a behavioural programme were compared with at risk infants in the control group on measures of sleeping, crying, and feeding at 12 weeks of age. Results: Infants who had a high number (>11) of feeds in 24 hours at 1 week were 2.7 times (95% CI 1.5 to 4.8) more likely than other control group infants to fail to sleep through the night at 12 weeks of age. At 12 weeks, 82% of these at risk infants assigned to the behavioural programme, compared to 61% in the control group, slept through the night. The findings were similar in breast and bottle feeders. Conclusions: Preventing infant sleeping problems should be more cost effective than treating them after they have arisen. This study provides evidence that it is possible to identify infants who are at risk of failing to sleep through the night at an early age, and that a simple, three step, preventive behavioural programme increases the number who sleep through the night by 21%.","Nikolopoulou, M. and St James-Roberts, I.",1,1151

In this study, we prospectively examined the epidemiological, clinical and molecular profile of CA-MRSA infections in children in central Greece. A total of 198 staphylococcal strains were isolated from patients with community-acquired infections over a 28-month period and 88 (44%) were found to be methicillin-resistant. Most patients with CA-MRSA had skin and soft-tissue infections (73%). Hospitalisation and surgery were more commonly required for patients with MRSA strains (p=0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). The presence of Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes was identified in 28/41 (68%) CA-MRSA strains.

1443,"The therapeutic efficacy of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12¬Æ in infant colic: A randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial","Background: The pathogenesis of infant colic is poorly defined. Gut microbiota seems to be involved, supporting the potential therapeutic role of probiotics. Aims: To assess the rate of infants with a reduction of ‚â•50% of mean daily crying duration after 28¬†days of intervention with the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12¬Æ (BB-12). Secondary outcomes were daily number of crying episodes, sleeping time, number of bowel movements and stool consistency. Methods: Randomized controlled trial (RCT) on otherwise healthy exclusively breastfed infants with infant colic randomly allocated to receive BB-12 (1¬†√ó¬†109¬†CFU/day) or placebo for 28¬†days. Gut microbiota structure and butyrate, beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2), cathelicidin (LL-37), secretory IgA (sIgA) and faecal calprotectin levels were assessed. Results: Eighty infants were randomised, 40/group. The rate of infants with reduction of ‚â•50% of mean daily crying duration was higher in infants treated with BB-12, starting from the end of 2nd week. No infant relapsed when treatment was stopped.

1446,A transactional model of infant still-face response and maternal behavior during the first year,"The present study takes a transactional approach to extend understanding of temporal relations between parenting behaviors and infant response to the face-to-face still-face, a widely used method assessing infants‚Äô affective and behavioral response to a violation of social expectations. A low-income, urban sample of 180 mothers and infants participated when infants were 4 and 6¬†months old. Directional relations between infants‚Äô still-face response (i.e., change in affect and gaze from interaction to still face) and three parenting dimensions were examined using cross-lagged structural equation models. Infant still-face response predicted later parenting behavior, while the reverse association was not significant. Specifically, infants with a greater reduction in positive affect from interaction to still face had parents with more positive parenting and less negative parenting behaviors 2¬†months later, controlling for prior parenting and concurrent infant behavior. Furthermore, infants who increased gaze to mother from interaction to still face had mothers who used more mental state talk 2¬†months later. Findings underscore the importance of examining transactional relations between infant and parent behaviors, and in particular highlight the influence of infants on parents. Acknowledging these infant-effects is critical to the development and implementation of interventions targeting parent-infant interactions. ¬© International Congress of Infant Studies (ICIS)","Northrup, J.

1447,Breastfeeding practices in mothers of high-respiratory-risk NICU infants: Impact of depressive symptoms and smoking,"Aim: Mothers of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) have very low breastfeeding rates and these high-respiratory-risk (HRR) NICU infants may benefit from breastfeeding through decreased risk for respiratory illnesses. This population's increased risk for maternal depression and high rates (22%) of maternal smoking may negatively affect breastfeeding. Objective: This exploratory study investigated associations of breastfeeding with depressive symptoms and maternal smoking in mothers of HRR NICU infants (i.e. presence of one household smoker and birth weight <1500g or mechanical ventilation ‚â•12h). Methods: Breastfeeding, depression and smoking data were collected from 104 mothers in the NICU following delivery. Results: Fifty-five (52.9%) mothers reported breastfeeding, 39 (37.5%) had a Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) score (‚â•16) suggestive of depression, and 36 (34.6%) reported smoking. Mothers with CES-D scores ‚â•16 were less likely to breastfeed compared to those with scores <16 (38.5% versus 61.5%","Northrup, T. F. and Wootton, S. H. and Evans, P. W. and Stotts, A. L.",0,1157
1448,Identification of neonatal hearing impairment: transient evoked otoacoustic emissions during the perinatal period,"OBJECTIVES: 1) To describe transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) levels, noise levels and signal to noise ratios (SNRs) for a range of frequency bands in three groups of neonates who were tested as a part of the Identification of Neonatal Hearing Impairment multi-center consortium project. 2) To describe the relations between these TEOAE measurements and age, test environment, baby state, and test time. DESIGN: TEOAEs were measured in 4478 graduates of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), 353 well babies with at least one risk indicator, and 2348 well babies without risk factors. TEOAE and noise levels were measured for frequency bands centered at 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 kHz for a click stimulus level of 80 dB SPL. For those ears not meeting ""passing"" stopping criteria at 80 dB pSPL, a level of 86 dB pSPL was included. Measurement-based stopping rules were used such that a test did not terminate unless the response revealed a criterion SNR in four out of five frequency bands or no response occurred after a preset number of averages. Baby state, test environment, and other test factors were captured at the time of test. RESULTS: TEOAE levels, noise levels and SNRs were similar for NICU graduates, well babies with risk factors and well babies without risk factors. There were no consistent differences in response quality as a function of test environment, i.e., private room, unit, open crib, nonworking isolette, or working isolette. Noise level varied little across risk group, test environment, or infant state other than crying, suggesting that the primary source of noise in TEOAE measurements is infant noise. The most significant effect on response quality was center frequency. Responses were difficult to measure in the half-octave band centered at 1.0 kHz, compared with higher frequencies. Reliable responses were measured routinely at frequencies of 1.5 kHz and higher. CONCLUSIONS: TEOAEs are easily measured in both NICU graduates and well babies with and without risk factors for hearing loss in a wide variety of test environments. Given the difficulties encountered in making reliable measurements for a frequency band centered at 1.0 kHz, its inclusion in a screening program may not be justified.","Norton, S. J. and Gorga, M.

1450,Dietary exposure to pesticide residues and associated health risks in infants and young children ‚Äì Results of the French infant total diet study,"A total diet study (TDS) was undertaken to estimate the chronic dietary exposure to pesticide residues and health risks for the French infants and young children below 3 years old. As a whole, 516 pesticides and metabolites were analysed in 309 food composite samples including 219 manufactured baby foods and 90 common foods, which cover 97% of infants and young children's diet. These composite samples were prepared using 5,484 food products purchased during all seasons from 2011 to 2012 and processed as consumed. Pesticide residues were detected in 67% of the samples and quantified in 27% of the baby food samples and in 60% of the common foods. Seventy-eight different pesticides were detected and 37 of these quantified at levels ranging from 0.02 to 594 ¬µg/kg. The most frequently detected pesticides (greater than 5% samples) were (1) the fungicides 2-phenylphenol, azoxystrobin, boscalid, captan and its metabolite tetrahydrophthalimide, carbendazim, cyprodinil, difenoconazole, dodine, imazalil, metalaxyl, tebuconazole, thiabendazole, (2) the insecticides acetamiprid, pirimiphos-methyl and thiacloprid, (3) the herbicide metribuzin and (4) the synergist piperonyl butoxide. Dietary intakes were estimated for each of the 705 individuals studied and for 431 pesticides incl. 281 with a toxicological reference value (TRV). In the lower-bound scenario, which tends to underestimate the exposure, the TRV were never exceeded. In the upper-bound scenario that overestimates exposure, the estimated intakes exceeded the TRV for dieldrin and lindane (two persistent organic pollutants) and propylene thiourea, a metabolite of propineb. For these three substances, more sensitive analyses are needed to refine the assessment. For 17 other detected and/or prioritised pesticides, the risk could not be characterised due to the lack of a valid TRV, of certain food analyses or the absence of analytical standards for their metabolites. ¬© 2020 The Authors","Nougad√®re, A. and Sirot, V. and Cravedi, J.

1452,Drug and vaccine development for the treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections,"Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans, affecting millions of people every year. UTI cause significant morbidity in women throughout their lifespan, in infant boys, in older men, in individuals with underlying urinary tract abnormalities, and in those that require long-term urethral catheterization, such as patients with spinal cord injuries or incapacitated individuals living in nursing homes. Serious sequelae include frequent recurrences, pyelonephritis with sepsis, renal damage in young children, pre-term birth, and complications of frequent antimicrobial use including high-level antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile colitis. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) cause the vast majority of UTI, but less common pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis and other enterococci frequently take advantage of an abnormal or catheterized urinary tract to cause opportunistic infections. While antibiotic therapy has historically been very successful in controlling UTI, the high rate of recurrence remains a major problem, and many individuals suffer from chronically recurring UTI, requiring long-term prophylactic antibiotic regimens to prevent recurrent UTI. Furthermore, the global emergence of multi-drug resistant UPEC in the past ten years spotlights the need for alternative therapeutic and preventative strategies to combat UTI, including anti-infective drug therapies and vaccines. In this chapter, we review recent advances in the field of UTI pathogenesis, with an emphasis on the identification of promising drug and vaccine targets. We then discuss the development of new UTI drugs and vaccines, highlighting the challenges these approaches face and the need for a greater understanding of urinary tract mucosal immunity. ¬© 2016 American Society for Microbiology.

The purpose of this study was to identify caregiver ACEs, current adversity, and resilience in families seeking care in pediatric acute care settings. Study aims included identifying demographic characteristics, current adversities, and resilience measures associated with caregiver ACEs ‚â•4. Design and Sample: A cross-sectional survey study design was used and a convenience sample (n = 470) recruited at emergency and urgent care settings of a large Midwest pediatric hospital system. Measures: Measures were self-reported. The original 10-item ACEs questionnaire measured caregiver past adversity. Current adversity was measured using the 10-item IHELP. The six-item Brief Resiliency Scale measured resilience, and WHO-5 Well-Being Index was used to measure depressive affect. Results: Compared to participants with ACEs score of 0-3 participants with ACEs ‚â•4 were more likely to have multiple current adversities, increased risk of depression, and lower resilience. Conclusions: Caregivers using pediatric acute care settings carry a high burden of ACEs and current adversities. Caregiver ACEs are associated with current child experiences of adversity. Caregivers socioeconomic status and education level may not be an accurate indicator of a family's risks or needs. Pediatric acute care settings offer opportunities to access, intervene, and prevent childhood adversity. ¬© 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","O'Malley, D. M. and Randell, K. A. and Dowd, M. D.",0,1165

1457,Temperament of preterm versus full-term infants,"Examined the temperament of 126 preterm infants as part of a longitudinal study of infant temperament and behavior in a representative sample of 2,443 Australian infants. Using the Infant Temperament Questionnaire, previously revised and validated for an Australian population, ratings were made at 4‚Äì8 mo corrected age, and data for the preterm group (less than 37 wks gestation) were compared to those infants born at term (37‚Äì41 wks). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups on any of the sociodemographic variables, on the mother's global rating of temperament, or on the reported incidence of colic, sleep problems, and excessive crying. There were also no differences between premature and full-term infants on any of the individual dimensions or clinical categories of temperament. It is concluded that prematurity does not affect observed temperament at 4‚Äì8 mo but that high-risk infants who experience medical complications of prematurity and require intensive care for prolonged periods may represent an entirely different category of risk for subsequent difficult temperament and behavior problems.

Previous studies in adult humans and animals, and a single study in human newborns, have indicated that more sleep might be expected following the carbohydrate feed compared with the water and balanced-formula feeds because of recruitment of centrally mediated serotonergic systems.

Also, infant sleep and arousal behavior and general development at 2 and 7 months were unremarkable, illustrating the possible safe and efficacious use of IT morphine during and following pregnancy. Further work is required to understand opioid pharmacology during breastfeeding, which will be used to develop an empirical approach to breastfeeding and morphine use.","Oberlander, T.

1460,Systematic review of pediatric health outcomes associated with childhood adversity,"Background: Early detection of and intervention in childhood adversity has powerful potential to improve the health and well-being of children. A systematic review was conducted to better understand the pediatric health outcomes associated with childhood adversity. Methods: PubMed, PsycArticles, and CINAHL were searched for relevant articles. Longitudinal studies examining various adverse childhood experiences and biological health outcomes occurring prior to age 20 were selected. Mental and behavioral health outcomes were excluded, as were physical health outcomes that were a direct result of adversity (i.e. abusive head trauma). Data were extracted and risk of bias was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Results: After identifying 15940 records, 35 studies were included in this review. Selected studies indicated that exposure to childhood adversity was associated with delays in cognitive development, asthma, infection, somatic complaints, and sleep disruption. Studies on household dysfunction reported an effect on weight during early childhood, and studies on maltreatment reported an effect on weight during adolescence. Maternal mental health issues were associated with elevated cortisol levels, and maltreatment was associated with blunted cortisol levels in childhood. Furthermore, exposure to childhood adversity was associated with alterations of immune and inflammatory response and stress-related accelerated telomere erosion. Conclusion: Childhood adversity affects brain development and multiple body systems, and the physiologic manifestations can be detectable in childhood. A history of childhood adversity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of developmental delay, asthma, recurrent infections requiring hospitalization, somatic complaints, and sleep disruption. The variability in children's response to adversity suggests complex underlying mechanisms and poses a challenge in the development of uniform diagnostic guidelines. More large longitudinal studies are needed to better understand how adversity, its timing and severity, and the presence of individual genetic, epigenetic, and protective factors affects children's health and development. ¬© 2018 The Author(s).","Oh, D.

Aims: To compare the effectiveness of swaddling versus massage therapy in the management of excessive crying of infants with cerebral insults. Methods: Randomised three-week parallel comparison of the efficacy of two intervention methods. Infants with symptoms of troublesome crying and their parents were randomly assigned to a swaddling intervention group (n = 13) or a massage intervention group (n = 12). Results: The amount of total daily crying decreased significantly in the swaddling group, but did not decrease significantly in the massage group. Infant behavioural profiles and maternal anxiety levels improved significantly in the swaddling group post-intervention. Parents in the swaddling group were more satisfied with the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing crying than parents in the massage group. Conclusion: Results indicate that swaddling may be more effective than massage intervention in reducing crying in infants with cerebral injuries.","Ohgi, S. and Akiyama, T. and Arisawa, K. and Shigemori, K.",0,1171
1462,Neonatal behavioural profile and crying in premature infants at term age,"Aim: To analyse behavioural characteristics of infants who cried more versus those who cried less, in a sample of low-risk premature infants. Methods: Participants were 63 low-risk healthy premature infants. At term age, the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) was administered, and a 1-d diary for crying was recorded starting on the following day. Infants were categorized into two groups: those with ""high level of crying"" ( ‚â•75th percentile) and those with ""less crying"" (<75th percentile), based on the total amount of crying time. Results: Some individual NBAS scores and ""habituation"" and ""regulation of state"" cluster scores were lower in the high-level-of-crying group. Infants in the group with a high level of crying had lower thresholds for response in the ""peak of excitement"", ""rapidity of build-up"", ""irritability"" and ""general irritability"" items. Logistic regression analysis revealed that lower ""habituation"" and ""regulation of state"" cluster scores were significantly associated with lower thresholds for crying. Conclusion: These results suggest that neonatal behavioural characteristics, such as hyperresponsivity and poor state regulation, are associated with high levels of crying. Clinical assessments based on the NBAS may help parents elucidate their infant's level of tolerance for stimuli, and identify strategies to minimize their crying. ¬© 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Ohgi, S. and Gima, H. and Akiyama, T.",0,1172
1463,Parental food involvement predicts parent and child intakes of fruits and vegetables,"In order to develop successful interventions to improve children's diets, the factors influencing food choice need to be understood. Parental food involvement - the level of importance of food in a person's life - may be one of many important factors. The aim of this study was to determine whether parental food involvement is associated with parents' and children's diet quality. As part of an intervention study, 394 parents with children aged between 18. months and 5. years were recruited from children's centres in Cornwall and Islington, UK. Questionnaires were used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, parents' diets, and attitudes towards food including food involvement. Children's diets were assessed using the multiple pass 24. h recall method. Parents reported low intakes of fruits and vegetables and high intakes of sugary items for themselves and their young children. Parental food involvement was strongly correlated with consumption of fruits and vegetables (amount and diversity) for both parents and children. Correlations with consumption of sugary drinks and snacks/foods were not significant. These findings indicate that parental food involvement may influence consumption of fruits and vegetables, more so than sugary items. Further research is needed to investigate how parental food involvement could mediate dietary changes. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Ohly, H. and Pealing, J. and Hayter, A. K.

1467,Continuous caudal epidural analgesia and early feeding in delayed bladder exstrophy repair: a nine-year experience,"BACKGROUND: Children undergoing primary closure of bladder exstrophy experience blood loss and significant fluid shifts¬†and require protracted periods of postoperative immobilization to avoid compromising the repair. Suboptimal anxiolysis and pain management is associated with increased morbidity. There is a lack of consensus on the optimal analgesic technique and studies have not previously described analgesic management in delayed bladder exstrophy closure. In exstrophy management, opioid infusions and benzodiazepine sedation are commonplace but are associated with dose-dependent respiratory and gastrointestinal side-effects. We present nine years of caudal epidural anaesthesia in delayed bladder exstrophy repair and describe its facilitation of early extubation and early feeding (within 12¬†h) without surgical complication. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated consecutive infants with classic bladder exstrophy undergoing delayed primary closure with anterior pelvic osteotomies between November 2007 and January 2016. Outcomes and complications were evaluated in terms of postoperative comfort (using the FLACC score-Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability), epidural failure rate, re-intubation rate¬†and gastrointestinal complications. RESULTS: Forty-four infants had average age of 5.8 months (range 1.6-17.1 months) and weight of 7.0¬†kg (range 3.5-11.8¬†kg), and their duration of surgery was 9.5¬†h (range 6.9-14.3¬†h). Forty-two of 44 (95.5%) patients received caudal epidural catheters. At 24¬†h, 15 of 42 (35.7%) caudal epidurals required supplementation with intravenous opioids. Fewer patients with optimally functioning epidurals required postoperative ventilation (1/27 [3.7%] compared with 3/15 [20.0%]). None of the patients with caudal epidural catheters required re-intubation.

1468,Early problematic eating behaviours are associated with lower fruit and vegetable intake and less dietary variety at 4-5 years of age. A prospective analysis of three European birth cohorts,"Problematic eating behaviours during early childhood could be mediators of poor dietary habits. This study aims to prospectively relate early eating behaviours with fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake and a healthy diet variety score of children aged between 4 and 5 years. Eating behaviours were assessed in three European birth cohorts (Generation XXI from Portugal, ALSPAC from the UK and EDEN from France) at 4-6, 12-15, 24 and 48-54 months of age, based on the child's feeding difficulties, mother's perception of child's poor eating (eating small quantities at each meal, not eating enough or needing to be stimulated to eat), food refusal and difficulties in the establishment of daily food routines. Daily servings of F&V (>1 v. ‚â§1 serving/d, except in Generation XXI: >3 v. ‚â§3) and the Healthy Plate Variety Score (categorised by the median score of each sample) were calculated using FFQ. Associations were tested by logistic regressions adjusted for maternal age, education, smoking during pregnancy, any breast-feeding and the child's z-score BMI at 4-5 years of age. Children with more feeding difficulties, poor eating, food refusal/neophobia and difficulties in establishing a daily routine at 12-15, 24 and 48-54 months of age had in general lower F&V intake at 4-5 years of age. The association with vegetables was slightly stronger than with fruits. These early feeding problems were also inversely associated with the variety score at 4-5 years of age, particularly when eating behaviours were reported after 12-15 months of age. A better understanding of these early feeding difficulties may help define strategies to increase the dietary quality in children. ¬© 2015 The Authors.","Oliveira, A. and Jones, L. and De Lauzon-Guillain, B. and Emmett, P. and Moreira, P. and Charles, M.

1469,"Problems of feeding, sleeping and excessive crying in infancy: a general population study","OBJECTIVE: To study regulatory problems (RPs) of feeding, sleeping and excessive crying in infancy, and explore the influence of maternal mental health problems and parent-child relationship problems. DESIGN AND SETTING: Data were collected in the general child health surveillance delivered to infant families by community health nurses (CHNs). Information on CHNs' assessments and conclusions were obtained on 2598 infants and merged with data from national registers. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to study RPs in early and late infancy, and the influences due to child, family and parent-child relationship problems. RESULTS: Combined RPs (C-RPs), defined as two or more simultaneous problems of feeding, sleeping or excessive crying, was identified in 2.9% and 8.6% of the population between age 2-6 and 8-11 months, respectively. Low maternal schooling and immigrant parents were associated with an increased risk of late C-RPs, but RPs in early infancy stand out as the main predictor of late C-RPs OR 3.4 (95% CI 1.8 to 6.6), and the effect of early maternal mental health problems and parent-child relationship problems seem to be mediated by early C-RPs. CONCLUSIONS: Combined problems of feeding, sleeping or excessive crying may exist throughout infancy independently of exposures to maternal mental health problems and parent-child relationship problems. The results indicate that infants with RPs exceeding age 2‚Äâmonths need special attention, in clinical as well as community settings. Suggested intervention includes specific guidance to the parents to help them understand and regulate their infant's sensitivity and reactions.","Olsen, A. L. and Ammitzb√∏ll, J. and Olsen, E.

1470,Oral sweet solution to prevent pain during neonatal hip examination: a randomised controlled trial,"AIM: To determine if oral glucose can have a pain-relieving effect during routine hip examinations in newborn infants. METHODS: In this randomised controlled study 100 newborn infants undergoing the routine physical examination including the potentially painful hip examination were included between March 2016 and April 2017. Fifty infants were randomised to water (control) and 50 to oral glucose (intervention) before their examination. Pain was assessed using crying time, Astrid Lindgren and Lund Children's Hospital Pain and Stress Assessment Scale (ALPS-Neo) and Visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: Total crying time (p¬†=¬†0.006), crying time during the hip examination (p¬†=¬†0.026), ALPS-Neo (p¬†=¬†0.004) and VAS (p¬†=¬†0.006) (when assessed by the physician) were all significantly decreased in the group of infants receiving glucose. VAS assessment made by the parents did not reach statistical significance (p¬†=¬†0.127). CONCLUSION: Oral glucose given before the examination has a pain-relieving effect during the hip examination in healthy newborn infants.","Olsson, E. and Pettersson, M. and Eriksson, M. and Ohlin, A.",0,1179
1471,Characterization of Upper Gastrointestinal Motility in Infants With Persistent Distress and Non-IgE-mediated Cow's Milk Protein Allergy,"BACKGROUND: Persistent crying in infancy is common and may be associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and/or non-IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA). We aimed to document upper gastrointestinal motility events in infants with CMPA and compare these to findings in infants with functional GERD. METHODS: Infants aged 2 to 26 weeks with persistent crying, GERD symptoms and possible CMPA were included. Symptoms were recorded by 48-hour cry-fuss chart and validated reflux questionnaire (infant GERD questionnaire [IGERDQ]). Infants underwent a blinded milk elimination-challenge sequence to diagnose CMPA. GERD parameters and mucosal integrity were assessed by 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring before and after cow's milk protein (CMP) elimination. C-octanoate breath testing for gastric emptying dynamics, dual-sugar intestinal permeability, fecal calprotectin, and serum vitamin D were also measured.

This pilot study was the first attempt to examine the intermediate effects of an ongoing parenting home visiting program, Minding the Baby (MTB), on parental reflective functioning (RF) and child behavior. Results indicated that the women who participated in the MTB intervention described their children-when assessed post-intervention-as having significantly fewer externalizing child behaviors. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups on parental RF from the end of the intervention to follow-up. The central finding that children who participated with the MTB program were reported to have significantly fewer externalizing behaviors following the intervention has important clinical and public health implications. Recommendations for the design of future follow-up studies and for further exploration of parental RF as it relates to the MTB outcomes are discussed. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Ordway, M.

1475,Parental reflective functioning: Analysis and promotion of the concept for paediatric nursing,"Aims and objectives: To identify the definitional elements of parental reflective functioning and develop a framework for nurses to apply this concept in their clinical work with families. Background: In recent years, researchers have concluded that parental reflective functioning is a key mechanism in the development of child attachment security leading to lifelong mental and physical health benefits. Despite its clinical relevance, little has been published in the nursing literature on this concept. Design: Concept analysis. Methods: The Walker and Avant (2011, Strategies for theory construction in nursing. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ) method of concept analysis and the Whittemore and Knafl (Journal of Advanced Nursing, 52, 2005, 546) method of integrative review were used. A search of the literature published from 1989-2013 was conducted using edited texts and online databases - Scopus, CINAHL, PubMed and PsychInfo. Among the 85 sources, 31 empirical studies, 17 book chapters, 32 review papers and five case studies were identified concerning parental reflective functioning. Results: The concept of reflective functioning, defined as the capacity to envision the mental states of self and other, was first described in 1989 by Fonagy. Slade (Attachment and Human Development, 7, 2005, 269) expanded the concept specifically for parents (i.e. parental reflective functioning). Results of this concept analysis describe seven defining attributes and five antecedent conditions. Consequences of parental reflective functioning are related to a child's attachment early in life and behaviour later in life. A model case is provided to contextualise the concept. To date, there are three measures for parental reflective functioning. Conclusions: While parental reflective functioning has been predominately featured in psychology and parenting interventions, the potential consequences of secure attachment and longer-term children's behavioural outcomes suggest that the concept has global implications for paediatric nurses and primary healthcare clinicians. Relevance to clinical practice: Parental reflective functioning offers exciting and promising opportunities for paediatric health and new approaches for those who provide paediatric health care. ¬© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Ordway, M.

The questionnaire was completed by primary caretakers of 69 infants aged 1 to 58 weeks suspected of having reflux. Median time to complete the questionnaire was 20 minutes. The median internal consistency of 29 pairs of redundant questions was 0.94. Median test-retest consistency of 110 items for nine respondents was 0.88. Median interobserver consistency, evaluated for 129 items in 35 questionnaires also filled out by secondary caretakers, was 0.85. The median accuracy of four externally validated items was 1.00.

Differences were analyzed by Chi-square, and odds ratios were defined. The diagnostic validity of a 25-point I-GERQ GERD score based on 11 items on the questionnaire was evaluated by calculating its sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. We found that normal infants had a high prevalence of reflux symptoms, such as daily regurgitation (40%), respiratory symptoms, crying more than an hour a day (17%), arching (10%), or daily hiccups (36%) but that many symptoms were significantly more prevalent in the GERD than in the normal infants (Chi-square P < .05), and odds ratios were above 3 for nearly 20 items. The positive and negative predictive values for the 25-point I-GERQ score were 1.00 and .94-.98, respectively. Environmental smoke exposure did not quite reach significance as a provocative factor for GERD. Although normal infants have a high prevalence of symptoms suggesting GERD, a simple questionnaire-based score is a valid diagnostic test with high positive and negative predictive values.","Orenstein, S.

Methods: One hundred three mother-infant pairs were evaluated. Data on maternal reports of infant feeding, sleeping and temperament patterns were collected at each well-child visit. The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale was used to assess depressive symptoms. A psychiatrist interviewed the mothers with depressive symptoms, and psychiatric treatments were administered accordingly. The associations between depressive symptoms and maternal perceptions at each visit were analyzed by taking into account the entire follow-up period. Results: Thirty-five mothers (34%) scored within the clinical range of the EPDS during the follow-up period. Mothers with elevated depressive symptoms were more inclined to report infant cry-fuss, sleeping and temperamental problems through the follow-up. Such complains on infant cry-fuss and temperament problems and maternal sleeping problems improved after treatment in compliant mothers. The dropout rate was high (58.3%) in noncompliant mothers. Conclusion: Postpartum depressive symptoms may lead to negative maternal perceptions of infant patterns. Earlier management of these disorders and maternal compliance to psychiatric suggestions may provide a better care for the mother-infant pairs. ¬© 2007 The Author(s).","Orhon, F.

1483,Automatic newborn cry analysis: a non-invasive tool to help autism early diagnosis,"Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex developmental disabilities that cause problems with social interaction and communication. ASD are associated with motor development problems, more or less blurred, and with perceptual and sensory brain areas. Crying is the infant's earliest form of communication and recent studies connect this original ""language"" form with autism disturbs. Being completely non-invasive, cry analysis is an appealing approach for early ASD diagnosis to improve rehabilitation. To this aim, we have developed an automatic system to record newborn cry and movements, during the first six months of life with a specific recording protocol. In this work we present first results of acoustic cry analysis in newborns classified as high-risk subjects being siblings of children already diagnosed as autistics. The work aims at finding possible early ASD signs in high-risk subjects as compared to a group of control subjects based on the fundamental frequency and the vocal tract resonance frequencies. Also, voiced and unvoiced parts of signal and cry-episodes duration are analyzed.","Orlandi, S. and Manfredi, C. and Bocchi, L. and Scattoni, M. L.",0,1191

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Included in the baseline cross-sectional analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial to prevent obesity were 842 caregivers of 2-month-old infants presenting for well-child care at 4 academic institutions. Food insecurity exposure was based on an affirmative answer to 1 of 2 items in a 2-item validated questionnaire. Chi-square tests examined the association between parent feeding practices and food security status. Logistic regression adjusted for covariates. Differences in caregiver feeding practices by food security status and race/ethnicity were explored with an interaction term (food security status x race/ethnicity).

1486,Problematic eating behaviour in Turkish children aged 12-72 months: characteristics of mothers and children,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine prevalence of problematic eating behaviour (PEB), associated risk factors, feeding practices including place of meal, variety of diet, and habits of consuming junk food, the mothers' perception of the child growth status in comparison to his/ her peers, and the effects on anthropometric measurements. METHODS: This study was carried out among children aged 12-72 months who attended the outpatient clinic in the Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital between February-June 2007. Three hundred and thirty-one mothers of children were asked to complete an extensive questionnaire covering socio-demographic characteristics and their child's general eating behaviour and feeding practices at mealtimes. Children with PEB were identified based on their mothers' statements. RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-one cases were 3.32 +/- 1.39 years old. One hundred thirty-five mothers reported having a child with PEB. The mothers described the children's problematic behaviour as: need to walk around with the child during mealtime (45.6%), watching TV during meals (41.9%), picky or fussy eating (39%), vomiting and/or retching (25.7%), retaining food in the mouth for a long time (20.6%), and not eating solid foods (11.8%). In children who had ate neither meat nor vegetables and fruits, took cod-liver oil-containing supplement during the course of the study, and had taken iron supplements in the first year of life, PEB was more frequent than in others. The mean z scores of weight for age (WAZ) were significantly lower in cases with PEB than without PEB. DISCUSSION: Counselling and supporting of the mother/caregiver could alleviate the effect of inappropriate solutions taken by families. Insistence on composing of the diet variety including especially vegetables, fruits and meat may be promoted by provision of alternative cooking/presentation samples to mothers of children who refuse some foods. Pediatricians should be alerted that lower WAZ values may be a warning indicating a problem which may cause stagnated growth in children with PEB.","Or√ºn, E. and Erdil, Z. and Cetinkaya, S. and Tufan, N. and Yal√ßin, S.

1487,"Self-medication for infants with colic in Lagos, Nigeria","Background: Infantile colic is a self-limiting condition that is distributed worldwide. It is often misdiagnosed as an organic disease for which an infant is admitted to the hospital. Many studies have described the aetiopathogenesis, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic management of colic but none has evaluated self-medication for infants with colic. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the knowledge of Nigerian mothers about colic, their home-based management, extent of self-medication for the infants with colic and the types of medicines involved. Methods: It is a prospective study conducted at the vaccination clinics of 20 primary health care centres, each from different Local Government Areas in Lagos, Nigeria. Eight hundred mothers that brought their infants for vaccination between April and September, 2006 were interviewed with open-and close-ended questionnaire. Results: Six hundred and eighty three (85.4%) mothers claimed they had a good knowledge of colic. Incessant and excessive cry was the main clinical feature of colic identified by 430(62.9%) mothers. Three hundred and seventy eight (67.7%) infants were treated by self-medication, 157 (28.1%) sought medical intervention and 17 (3.1%) were treated at a traditional birth attendant home. Herbal medicines constituted 51.8% of the self-medicated medicines, of which 48 (26.2%) were ""Ororo Ogiri"". Nospamin¬Æ (49.5%) and Gripe water¬Æ (43.0%) were the two frequently prescribed and self-medicated medicines for infants with colic. Conclusion: Nigerian mothers are deficient in their knowledge of colic. Self-medication was the most frequently used home-based intervention. Health education would appear necessary to improve parental management of this self-limiting condition. ¬© 2009 Oshikoya et al","Oshikoya, K. A. and Senbanjo, I. O. and Njokanma, O. F.",0,1194

STUDY DESIGN: An observational cross-sectional study. Sixty preterm infants, categorized into nCPAP (n=37) and HHHFNC groups (n=23). Pain response was assessed using Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), duration of first cry and salivary-cortisol concentrations. RESULT: The PIPP scores were significantly higher in the nCPAP compared with HHHFNC group (10 (7-12) vs 4 (2-6), P<0.01). None of the infants in the HHHFNC group had severe pain defined as a PIPP score >12, compared with 5 (13.5%) infants in the nCPAP group. Salivary-cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in nCPAP group compared with the HHHFNC group (5.0 (3.6-5.9) vs 1.6 (1.0-2.3) nmol‚Äâl(-1), P<0.01). A lower incidence of cry was observed for infants in the HHHFNC group compared with the nCPAP group (11 (47.8%) vs 30 (81.1%), P<0.001), however, the duration of first cry was not significantly different between groups. The respiratory rate was significantly lower after application of HHHFNC compared with nCPAP (P<0.001). There were no significant differences between groups with regard to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), oxygen saturation by pulse oximeter (SpO2) and heart rate. CONCLUSION: The application of HHHFNC in preterm infants is associated with less pain compared with nCPAP, as it is associated with less PIPP scores and lower salivary-cortisol concentrations.","Osman, M. and Elsharkawy, A. and Abdel-Hady, H.",0,1195
1489,A structural modeling approach to the understanding of parenting stress,"Tested and cross-validated a multidimensional model of predictors of parenting stress on data from a population-based sample of 1,081 Swedish mothers with children ages 6 months to 3 years. The study was a cross-sectional questionnaire study, focusing on the explanation of variance in parenting stress. Structural equation modeling procedures permitted disentanglement of total, direct, and indirect effects. A Swedish instrument based on parts of the Parent Domain in the Parenting Stress Index was used as a measure of stress. The results provided general support for the proposed model. High workload, low social support, perception of the child as fussy-difficult, negative life events, child caretaking hassles, more children in the family, and high maternal age related directly to more stress. Child irregularity contributed indirectly to mother's experienced stress. No buffering effects of social support were found Forty-eight percent of the variance in the parenting stress measure was explained by the model Implications for interventions were discussed.

1490,Feeding and sleeping problems in infancy - a follow-up at early school age,"Background: Feeding and sleeping problems are common during infancy. Many regulatory problems of this kind are connected to various child and family factors. This study is a follow-up of children with early feeding and/or sleeping problems, 6 years after clinical contacts. Methods:: A total of 230 families (72%) participated in the questionnaire follow-up. Children and parents were compared with 227 (71%) reference families regarding sleeping and feeding problems, health factors in parent and child, psychosocial problems, stressful life events, social support, life satisfaction, and externalizing and internalizing behaviour in the child.Results: Six years after clinical contacts the children with early feeding and/or sleeping problems still had more problems of this kind compared with the reference children. Early child health problems were more frequent within the clinical group, but recent health problems did not separate the two groups. Mothers in the clinical sample reported more health problems than mothers in the reference group and clinical parents were less content with their social support and had more psychosocial problems, including stressful life events. Children in the clinical sample had more internalizing problems than comparison children. Recent feeding and sleeping problems were connected to more externalizing and internalizing problems.Conclusions: Early regulatory problems, concerning sleeping or feeding, are less frequent when the child grows up, but nevertheless tend to remain. A clinical recommendation for child health care is to take both child and family factors into account, to individualize contacts, work with an all-inclusive perspective and have close follow-ups. ¬© 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","√ñstberg, M. and Hagelin, E.",0,1197

Method: A descriptive correlational design was used. Seventeen HIV-infected mothers and their infants were recruited from a university clinic in Alabama. Assessments were gathered at the infant's pediatric clinic appointments (approximately 6 weeks after delivery) and included a demographic questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory-II, the Maternal Confidence Questionnaire, the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, and the Questionnaire About Physical Contact. Results: Dysfunctional parent-child interactions significantly correlated with maternal confidence, parent stress, and overall feeling about physical contact. Difficult child temperament correlated with overall and current feelings of physical contact and parent stress. Significant correlations were found between parent distress, parent stress, and maternal depression. Discussion: Beyond the need to assist HIV-infected mothers with stress and depression, an intervention is needed to facilitate optimal parent-child interactions and improve both child psychosocial and cognitive outcomes. ¬© 2012.","Oswalt, K.

1495,The influence of the gastrointestinal microbiome on infant colic,"Introduction: Although infantile colic is relatively frequent, its pathophysiology is not yet understood. The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of the link between infantile colic and the gastro-intestinal microbiome. Areas covered: The gastro-intestinal microbiome may already start to develop in the womb and grows exponentially immediately after birth. Factors influencing the microbiome can cause dysbiosis and precipitate symptoms of colic through several mechanisms such as increased gas-production and low grade gut inflammation. Other possible factors are immaturity of the enterohepatic bile acid cycle and administration of antibiotics and other medications during the perinatal period. An effective treatment for all colicky infants has yet to be discovered, but the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 was shown to be effective in breastfed infants with colic. The scientific databases ‚ÄúPubmed‚Äù and ‚ÄúGoogle scholar‚Äù were searched from inception until 02/2020. Relevant articles were selected based on the abstract. Expert Opinion: Recent literature confirmed that the composition of the gastro-intestinal microbiome is associated with the development of infantile colic. It can be speculated that full sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to identify the microbiome down to the species level may provide answers to the etiology and management of infantile colic. ¬© 2020, ¬© 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Ouald Chaib, A. and Levy, I.

1497,Using topical benzocaine before lingual frenotomy did not reduce crying and should be discouraged,"AIM: The US Food and Drug Administration has said that oral preparations containing benzocaine should only be used in infants under strict medical supervision, due to the rare, but potentially fatal, risk of methemoglobinemia. This study aimed to determine the analgesic effect of topical application of benzocaine prior to lingual frenotomy in infants with symptomatic tongue-tie. We hypothesised that the duration of crying immediately following frenotomy with topical benzocaine would be shorter than with no benzocaine. METHODS: This randomised controlled study compared the length of crying after lingual frenotomy in term infants who did, or did not, receive topical application of benzocaine to the lingual frenulum prior to the procedure. RESULTS: We recruited 21 infants to this study. Crying time was less than one minute in all of the subjects. The average length of crying in the benzocaine group (21.6 ¬± 13.6 sec) was longer than the length of crying in the control group (13.1 ¬± 4.0 sec), p = 0.103. CONCLUSION: Contrary to our hypothesis, infants who were treated with topical benzocaine did not benefit from topical analgesia in terms of crying time. The use of benzocaine for analgesia prior to lingual frenotomy in term infants should therefore be discouraged.","Ovental, A. and Marom, R. and Botzer, E. and Batscha, N. and Dollberg, S.",0,1203
1498,Associations between breastfeeding mode and duration and food neophobia in toddlerhood: A cross-sectional study among Norwegian toddlers,"Background: Research on the association between breastfeeding duration and food neophobia is inconclusive. Breastfeeding and measures to reduce food neophobia are highly recommended to ensure a healthy diet early in life. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between breastfeeding duration and food neophobia in young Norwegian children. Design: Participants (n = 246) were recruited through kindergartens in four Norwegian counties in 2017. The parents of 1-year-olds filled in questionnaires, including standardized questions on breastfeeding and food neophobia. Cross-sectional results are presented. Comparisons of child neophobia score at 16 months of age according to breastfeeding status at various timepoints during infancy were explored in linear regression models adjusted for maternal education and parental food neophobia. Results: Still being breastfed at 12 months and being exclusively breastfed at 5 months were independently associated with slightly higher food neophobia score at the mean age of 16 months compared to shorter duration of breastfeeding. We found no other associations between breastfeeding duration and child food neophobia. Discussion: Our study adds to the somewhat scarce literature regarding associations between breastfeeding mode and duration and later food neophobia","√òverby, N. C. and Blomkvist, E. A.

1499,Receipt and timing of pregnancy-related preventive health messages vary by message type and maternal characteristics,"Purpose. To determine when women receive pregnancy-related preventive health messages and to examine differences in receipt timing by maternal characteristics. Design. The cross-sectional secondary analyses used data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). Setting. The study used PRAMS responses from Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio. Subjects. Study participants were women with a recent live birth. Measures. Health messages included mental health, safe medications, smoking, alcohol, and illegal drugs. The timing of message receipt was categorized as early (preconceptionally and prenatally) or late (prenatally only/never). Analysis. Weighted v2 tests and multivariable logistic regression were used for analysis. Results. Among n 3446, women with unintended pregnancies received all messages, except safe medications, significantly more early vs. late compared with women intending pregnancies (all p , .01). In multivariable analyses, there were no significant associations between timing of receipt and pregnancy intention, parity, preconception insurance status, or adequacy of prenatal care for any of the health messages. Hispanic women had increased odds of receiving the messages early compared with non- Hispanic white women, as did high school graduates vs. women with more education and women with lower household incomes vs. women with higher incomes. Conclusions. Women who may be perceived to be at higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and/or engaging in high-risk behavior (minorities, lower education, lower income) appear to be getting messages early more often than do other women","Oza-Frank, R. and Kachoria, R. and Keim, S.

1500,"Effect of soothing techniques on infants' self-regulation behaviors (sleeping, crying, feeding): A randomized controlled study","AIM: To determine the effect of teaching 4S soothing techniques (swaddling, holding at side or stomach position, shushing-white noise, swinging) on parent-reported infants' self-regulation behaviors with respect to sleeping, crying, and feeding. METHODS: This research is a pretest-post-test, single-blind randomized experimental study with 6‚Äâmonth follow-ups. An intervention group (IG) and a control group (CG) were formed, each consisting of 21 mother-infant dyads. A 90‚Äâmin training program was applied to the mothers in the IG during the home visit in the fourth week after birth. For both groups, the dependent variables of the study are the parent-reported self-regulation behaviors of the infants in weeks 3, 7, 11, and 23. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the two groups before the intervention in the pretest in terms of the mean sleep duration, mean crying duration, frequency of feeding, and frequency of waking at night. After the teaching of the 4S soothing techniques had been conducted, it was determined that the mean frequency of waking at night, the mean frequency of daily feeding, and the mean daily crying duration of the infants in the IG was statistically significantly lower in all follow-ups, compared to the infants in the CG. In weeks 7 and 11 after the intervention, the mean daily sleep duration of the infants in the IG was found to be statistically significantly higher, compared to the infants in the CG. CONCLUSION: Health professionals can use the 4S soothing techniques to develop self-regulation behaviors of infants during the first 12‚Äâweeks of the infancy period.","√ñzt√ºrk D√∂nmez, R. and Bayik Temel, A.",1,1206
1502,Normal sleep development in infants: findings from two large birth cohorts,"Objective: Sleep difficulties are highly prevalent and often persistent in young children, but sometimes parents are worried about sleep symptoms that belong to the normative range rather than to actual disturbances. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the normative development of sleep at the ages of 3, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months in healthy children. Methods: The present study is based on two birth cohorts that comprise representative samples of families recruited systematically during pregnancy. In the CHILD-SLEEP cohort, the sample sizes were 1427 at three, 1301 at eight, 1163 at 18, and 950 at 24 months. In the Finnbrain cohort, the sample sizes were 2002 at six months and 1693 at 12 months. Healthy term-born children were eligible for this study. To assess the infants' sleep duration and sleep quality, the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire was used in both cohorts and additionally the Infant Sleep Questionnaire in the CHILD-SLEEP cohort. The distributions of the study variables were reported using standard parameters. Results: We found that sleep quality is highly variable particularly during the first two years of life, but this variability decreased markedly towards the second year. First, sleep latency decreased by the age of six months, while night-time sleep began to consolidate during the second year. However, parent-reported sleeping problems were common during the entire study period. Conclusion: As many families struggle with infants' sleeping problems, the reference values reported in this article can be valuable tools in various clinical settings to define clinically significant deviances in the sleep development and to identify individuals benefitting from counselling and clinical interventions. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Paavonen, E.

1504,Evaluation of retinopathy of prematurity screening in reverse Kangaroo Mother Care: a pilot study,"PURPOSE: To evaluate retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) screening practice in reverse Kangaroo Mother Care (R-KMC) with respect to stress and pain to the infant. METHODS: In a pilot study we evaluated ROP screening practice in R-KMC in 20 babies at risk of ROP. The R-KMC differed from the conventional KMC with respect to the baby position where the baby lay supine on mother's chest. With the mother lying supine and the baby in R-KMC position, screening examinations were done with indirect ophthalmoscope. The outcome measures included stress (quantified by pulse, respiration, and oxygen saturation) and pain to the baby by observing facial expression (eye squeezing, crying, and brow bulge). The heart rate, respiratory rate, and SpO2 (%) were compared before and immediately after the procedure using paired t-test. RESULT: Mean (¬±SD) gestational age and birth weight were 30.8¬±2.3 weeks and 1362.5¬±253.9‚Äâg, respectively. During examination in R- KMC position 8 babies (40%) were completely relaxed (no eye squeezing and crying), 10 (50%) were partially relaxed (no brow bulge) and 2 babies (10%) were not relaxed. A change in heart and respiration rate both by 10 per minute was recorded in 12 (60%) and 10 (50%) babies, respectively. Five babies (25%) had reduction in blood oxygen concentration below 92%. The majority of the mothers (19 of 20) were relaxed. CONCLUSION: ROP screening in R-KMC can be a baby friendly screening practice with respect to stress and pain to the infant and needs further evaluation in a larger cohort.","Padhi, T.

1505,Breastmilk from obese mothers has pro-inflammatory properties and decreased neuroprotective factors,"Objective: To determine the impact of maternal obesity on breastmilk composition. Study Design: Breastmilk and food records from 21 lean and 21 obese women who delivered full-term infants were analyzed at 2 months post-partum. Infant growth and adiposity were measured at birth and 2 months of age. Result: Breastmilk from obese mothers had higher omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acid ratio and lower concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, docasapentaenoic acid and lutein compared with lean mothers (P<0.05), which were strongly associated with maternal body mass index. Breastmilk saturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fatty acid concentrations were positively associated with maternal dietary inflammation, as measured by dietary inflammatory index. There were no differences in infant growth measurements. Conclusion: Breastmilk from obese mothers has a pro-inflammatory fatty acid profile and decreased concentrations of fatty acids and carotenoids that have been shown to have a critical role in early visual and neurodevelopment. Studies are needed to determine the link between these early-life influences and subsequent cardiometabolic and neurodevelopmental outcomes. ¬© 2016 Nature America, Inc.","Panagos, P.

1506,Is kangaroo mother care effective in alleviating vaccination associated pain in early infantile period? A RCT,"BACKGROUND: Childhood vaccination is a common procedure and a part of routine medical care during infancy. Although vaccination is the cornerstone for prevention of many infectious diseases, it is associated with significant pain, which is often ignored. Non pharmacological interventions such as breast feeding and kangaroo mother care (KMC) have been used to decrease this procedural pain. However there is paucity of published data on effective use of KMC in term neonates and infants beyond the neonatal age. METHOD: This randomized controlled trial included 61 infants ‚â§14‚ÄØweeks of postnatal age, and compared KMC to swaddling during vaccination. Neonatal infant pain scale (NIPS) was used to assess the pain associated with vaccination. RESULTS: NIPS scores at 1‚ÄØmin and 5‚ÄØmin after vaccination and duration of cry were significantly less in the KMC group. CONCLUSION: KMC is effective in reducing vaccination associated pain in young infants.","Pandita, A. and Panghal, A. and Gupta, G. and Verma, A. and Pillai, A. and Singh, A. and Naranje, K.",0,1210
1509,"Resilience, strengths, and regulatory capacities: Hidden resources in developmental disorders of infant mental health","Resilience research has demonstrated convincingly that the strengths of resilient children growing up adaptively in the midst of adversity can be traced back to salient attributes of the parent--infant system. Drawing on various strands of developmental infancy research, the present essay focuses on strengths in infants' intrinsic regulatory capacities, in the parents' intuitive communicative competence, and in parent--infant communication as a biologically based, reciprocal reward system. Adaptive and protective roles of the system are discussed in relation to normal developmental perturbations and individual variation on both sides of the system and, based on results from the Munich Interdisciplinary Research and Intervention Program for Fussy Babies, in relation to early excessive crying and other disorders of behavioral and emotional regulation. The final section outlines how this knowledge can be applied in systemic, strength-based approaches to parent--infant counseling and psychotherapy, with emphasis on the therapeutic potential of videomicroanalytic feedback. ¬© 2011 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.","Papou≈°ek, M.",0,1211
1510,Comparing the effects of swaddle and conventional bathing methods on behavioral responses in preterm neonates,"Background: The newborn's first bath, performed in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU), is believed to be a stressful situation, especially for the premature infants. As a developmental care approach, swaddle bathing is a low-stress bathing method for vulnerable preterm neonates. Given the limited number of the studies examining this bathing method, the present study was conducted with the aim of comparing the effects of swaddle and conventional bathing methods on some behavioral responses in premature infants. Methods: This study was a randomized clinical trial conducted on 50 premature neonates admitted to NICU. The neonates, who met the inclusion criteria, were randomly assigned into experimental and control groups. The infants in the experimental group received swaddle bathing and those in the control group were given conventional bathing. To record the behavioral responses, the infants' faces were filmed in close-up during the bathing. The data were analyzed, using Chi-squared test, independent samples t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The results demonstrated that the occurrence rates of such behaviors as facial grimace (P<0.001), mouthing/yawing movements (P<0.001), tongue extension (P=0.017), eyes open (P=0.027), and fussing/crying (P<0.001) were significantly lower in the experimental group than those in the control group. In addition, the percentage of eyes closed was higher in the experimental group, compared to the control group (P=0.006). Conclusion: According to the findings of this study, swaddle bathing can reduce the neonatal stress during bathing. Consequently, this kind of bathing can be used as an appropriate, low-stress, and pleasant method for the preterm neonates in NICU. ¬© 2016, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.

1513,Changes in symptoms of problematic eating over 6 months in infants and young children,"The purpose of this article is to describe changes in problematic eating symptoms across 6 months in children seen in an outpatient feeding clinic and explore child characteristics associated with symptom changes. Participants were 58 parents of children aged 6 months to 7 years of age who were seen in an outpatient feeding clinic. Parents completed an online survey at 3 time points: enrollment and 3 and 6 months later. The survey consisted of the Pediatric Eating Assessment Tool (PediEAT) and a set of questions assessing demographic information, child's medical and feeding history, medical diagnoses, gastrointestinal function, and medications. Linear mixed modeling was used to examine changes in PediEAT total and subscale scores over time and explore associated child characteristics. The PediEAT total score significantly decreased over time with the greatest change in the Physiologic Symptoms subscale. Several child characteristics were associated with more severe symptoms of problematic feeding: older child age, more symptoms of constipation, and diagnoses of speech-language delay, developmental delay, food allergy, and/or genetic disorder. Parent report of child symptoms of problematic eating decreased across 6 months. Associations with child characteristics highlight the complexity of pediatric eating problems and the need for more research on potential factors influencing symptoms of eating problems.

1514,Risk assessment based on urinary bisphenol A levels in the general Korean population,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high-volume industrial chemical used in the global production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, which are used in food and drink containers, such as tableware (plates and mugs). Due to its broad applications, BPA has been detected in human blood, urine and breast milk as well as environmental substances, including water, indoor and outdoor air, and dust. Indeed, exposure to high concentrations of BPA can result in a variety of harmful effects, including reproductive toxicity, through a mechanism of endocrine disruption. Our comparison of reported BPA urinary concentrations among different countries revealed that exposures in Korea may be higher than those in other Asian countries and North America, but lower than or similar to those in European countries. The current study included a total of 2044 eligible subjects of all ages. The subjects were evenly divided between males and females (48.58% and 51.42%, respectively). The geometric mean (GM) of pre-adjusted (adjusted) urinary BPA concentrations was 1.83¬†Œºg/L (2.01¬†Œºg/g creatinine) for subjects of all ages, and there was no statistically difference in BPA concentrations between males (1.90¬†Œºg/L, 1.87¬†Œºg/g creatinine) and females (1.76¬†Œºg/L, 2.16¬†Œºg/g creatinine). Multiple regression analysis revealed only one positive association between creatinine pre-adjusted urinary BPA concentration and age (Œ≤=‚àí0.0868, p<0.001). The 95th percentile levels of 24-hour recall (HR), food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) and estimated daily intake (EDI) through urinary BPA concentrations were 0.14, 0.13, and 0.22¬†Œºg/kg bw/day, respectively. According to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS), a tolerable daily intake (tDI) of 20¬†Œºg/kg bw/day was established for BPA from the available toxicological data. Recently, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established a temporary TDI of 4¬†Œºg/kg bw/day based on current toxicological data. By comparing these TDIs with subjects‚Äô exposure, we conclude that there are no health concerns for any age group as a result of current levels of dietary exposure to BPA. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Park, J.

Ss were 47 1-yr-old Korean infants and their mothers (mean age 31 yrs) from intact upper-middle class families. Mothers sorted the Attachment Q-set and filled out the Toddler Temperament Questionnaire. Maternal sensitivity was observed in the home for 2 3-hr sessions, and observers completed the Maternal Behavior Q-set. Mean attachment security score of the infants, using criterion scores developed with Korean infants, was .42, which is comparable to previous studies. During home observations, infants who were securely attached to mothers showed more secure-base behaviors and compliance, enjoyed physical contact, and showed fewer fussy/difficult behaviors with mothers. Mothers of girls were observed to be more sensitive to their infants' signals than mothers of boys. Maternal sensitivity scores were not related to infant security scores. However, boys of sensitive mothers were less compliant compared with boys of insensitive mothers. Infants' threshold of responsiveness was related to infants' attachment security scores. Infants' temperamental characteristics were not associated with maternal sensitivity. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","Park, Kyung Ja",0,1217
1516,"Maternal Type A behavior during pregnancy, neonatal crying, and early infant temperament: do type A women have type A babies?","It was hypothesized that type A behavior in pregnant women would be associated with increased neonatal crying and differential reports of infant temperament at 3 months. Type A behaviors during pregnancy were measured in a self-selected cohort of 72 healthy, primiparous, middle-class women. Their newborns were assessed at 48 hours of age and the women completed an infant temperament questionnaire at 3 months. Women who were classified as type A on the Job Involvement scale of the Jenkins Activity Survey had infants who cried more during a standardized neurobehavioral assessment compared with infants of women who were type B on the same scale. Women who were type A for Job Involvement rated their 3-month-old infants as more intense and less predictable in their responses to the environment. They were also more likely to be breast-feeding their infants at 3 months. This is the first study to examine the prevalence and nature of maternal type A behaviors during pregnancy and to show their relationship to neonatal crying behavior, to maternal report of early infant temperament, and to maternal breast-feeding.","Parker, S.

1517,"Direct, indirect, and buffering effects of support for mothers on children's socioemotional adjustment","Support for mothers may improve children's socioemotional adjustment, yet few studies have considered the benefits of formal support (from health and social work professionals) in addition to social support (from family and friends) or explored the mechanisms. These issues were addressed using a birth cohort (n = 2,649) to explore how mothers' perceptions of social and formal support when children were ages 10-22 months predicted trajectories of children's externalizing and internalizing problems from 58 to 122 months. We tested mediating pathways from support to child adjustment via 3 family stressors measured at 46-58 months (maternal distress, economic strain, and dysfunctional parenting) and examined whether support buffered effects of stressors on child adjustment. Social and formal support were simultaneously associated with lower child externalizing and internalizing problem trajectory intercepts at 90 months but did not predict trajectory slopes. Social support effects were mediated mainly via lower maternal distress, which then reduced children's problems via lower dysfunctional parenting, or more directly. Additional indirect effects involved lower economic strain. Formal support effects were mediated to a lesser extent by reduced dysfunctional parenting. Two buffering effects were found: social support reduced effects of economic strain on internalizing problems, and formal support reduced effects of dysfunctional parenting on internalizing problems. Findings suggest measures promoting families' social integration should benefit children's socioemotional adjustment via improved parental psychological and economic resources and by buffering impacts of economic strain. Enhancing access to health and welfare services through greater awareness and trust should benefit children's adjustment, via improved parenting and by buffering impacts of dysfunctional parenting. ¬© 2018 American Psychological Association.","Parkes, A. and Sweeting, H.",0,1219

METHODS: Healthy infants with persistent crying were randomly assigned to one of three groups for a 2-week period. All groups received an assessment and reassurance from a pediatrician and support from a public health nurse. Group 1 also received counseling regarding specific management techniques. Group 2 also received a car-ride simulation device. Group 3 acted as a control. Mothers completed crying diaries and preintervention and postintervention anxiety questionnaires. RESULTS: Thirty-eight mother-infant pairs were enrolled. Combining all three groups, there was a 24% reduction in daily hours of crying (P = .01) and a 18% improvement in maternal anxiety (P < .001), but no significant difference among groups. CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of persistent crying of infancy is improvement over time. These specific interventions proved no better than reassurance and support alone in decreasing daily hours of crying and maternal anxiety.","Parkin, P. C. and Schwartz, C. J. and Manuel, B.

1521,Duration of motherhood has incremental effects on mothers' neural processing of infant vocal cues: a neuroimaging study of women,"The transition to motherhood, and the resultant experience of caregiving, may change the way women respond to affective, infant signals in their environments. Nonhuman animal studies have robustly demonstrated that mothers process both infant and other salient signals differently from nonmothers. Here, we investigated how women with and without young infants respond to vocalisations from infants and adults (both crying and neutral). We examined mothers with infants ranging in age (1-14 months) to examine the effects of duration of maternal experience. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we found that mothers showed greater activity than nonmothers to vocalisations from adults or infants in a range of cortical regions implicated in the processing of affective auditory cues. This main effect of maternal status suggests a general difference in vocalisation processing across infant and adult sounds. We found that a longer duration of motherhood, and therefore more experience with an infant, was associated with greater infant-specific activity in key parental brain regions, including the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala. We suggest that these incremental differences in neural activity in the maternal brain reflect the building of parental capacity over time. This is consistent with conceptualizations of caregiving as a dynamic, learning process in humans.","Parsons, C. E. and Young, K. S. and Petersen, M. V. and Jegindoe Elmholdt, E.

1522,Compositional development of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus microbiota is linked with crying and fussing in early infancy,"Objectives: Our aim was to establish whether there is an interconnection between the compositional development of the gut microbiota and the amount of fussing and crying in early infancy. Methods: Behavioral patterns of 89 infants during the 7 th and 12 th week of life were recorded in parental diaries. Total distress was defined as the sum of daily amounts of crying and fussing. Infants' gut microbiota profiles were investigated by several molecular assays during the first six months of life. Results: The median (range) duration of total distress among the infants was 106 (0-478) minutes a day during the 7 th and 58 (0-448) minutes a day during the 12 th week. The proportion of Bifidobacterium counts to total bacterial counts was inversely associated with the amount of crying and fussing during the first 3 months of life (p = 0.03), although the number of Bifidobacterium breve was positively associated with total distress (p = 0.02). The frequency of Lactobacillus spp. at the age of 3 weeks was inversely associated with total infant distress during the 7 th week of life (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus appear to protect against crying and fussing.

While modifiable factors during infancy have been identified, until recently, preventive interventions had not been tested. The Intervention Nurses Starting Infants Growing on Healthy Trajectories (INSIGHT). Study is a longitudinal, randomized, controlled trial evaluating a responsive parenting intervention designed for the primary prevention of obesity. This "" parenting"" intervention is being compared with a home safety control among first-born infants and their parents. INSIGHT's central hypothesis is that responsive parenting and specifically responsive feeding promotes self-regulation and shared parent-child responsibility for feeding, reducing subsequent risk for overeating and overweight.Methods/Design: 316 first-time mothers and their full-term newborns were enrolled from one maternity ward. Two weeks following delivery, dyads were randomly assigned to the "" parenting"" or "" safety"" groups. Subsequently, research nurses conduct study visits for both groups consisting of home visits at infant age 3-4, 16, 28, and 40 weeks, followed by annual clinic-based visits at 1, 2, and 3 years.

1531,"Infants with ""colic""‚ÄîMothers' perspectives on the crying problem","Evaluated relationships between infant crying behavior and fussing behavior and the mother's causal attributions of the crying, her emotional responses to the crying, as well as her later perception of infant temperament. 20 mothers who presented their 3‚Äì9-wk-old infants in pediatric practices because of excessive crying (colic complaint group) and 20 mothers who visited for public preventive screening (control group) were compared. Mothers kept a baby diary. A structured interview with the mothers was conducted. When the babies were 4 mo old, mothers completed a temperament questionnaire. The colic complaint group was subdivided using the Wessel criteria. Infants from the colic complaint group who did not meet these criteria did not differ from control Ss in any of the parameters derived from the diaries. However, the mothers of this group described significantly heightened negative affect and cognitions of being rejected in response to the crying. Findings indicate that in regard to the colic problem, attention must be paid not only to the characteristics of the child, but also to aspects of maternal perception and processing of the crying problem.

Regression analyses were used to examine relations between cardiac acceleration and subjective aversiveness and 3 groups of postnatal dependent variables: perception of infant temperament, mother's emotional state, and appraisal of marriage. Results show that mothers who prenatally rated the cry recordings as more aversive postnatally described their 3 mo olds as more fussy/difficult and unpredictable. With statistical control for prenatal variation on the emotional state and marital outcome measures, cardiac acceleration predicted later marital quality. Females who showed greater cardiac acceleration to the cries described their postnatal marital relationships more negatively.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate sleep duration and quality as a function of child attachment to the mother. One hundred and thirty-four mother‚Äìchild dyads enrolled in the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) project were included in this study. Attachment was assessed with the Strange Situation procedure at 36¬†months and maternal sleep reports were collected at 6, 12, 24 and 36¬†months. Differences in sleep characteristics were assessed with mixed models with one factor (attachment group) and one repeated measure (age). Children classified as disorganized had a significantly lower duration of nocturnal sleep, went to bed later, signaled more awakenings, had shorter periods of uninterrupted sleep (only at 12¬†months) and had shorter periods of time in bed (only at 6¬†months) than children classified as secure and/or ambivalent (p¬†<¬†0.05). This is the first study to show that children with insecure disorganized attachment present a distinct sleep pattern in comparison with those with secure or ambivalent attachment between 6 and 36¬†months of age.

1540,Immune modulation in suckling rat pups by a growth factor extract derived from milk whey,"Oral tolerance to foreign enteral antigens is not fully developed in early neonatal life. Epidemiological evidence supports a role for maternal milk in the development of immune responses, including oral tolerance. Formula fed infants have an increased susceptibility to food allergy and the later development of autoimmune disease. This may relate to the lack in infant formula of growth factors found in maternal milk. Bovine milk contains proteins, growth factors and cytokines. Various studies have outlined the immune modulating potential of bovine milk-derived products. Fractionated whey extracts have therapeutic potential in disease states where there is an excessive inflammatory reaction, and disease preventive potential for infants who are not breast-fed. We have shown that daily oral administration of a growth factor enriched fraction from milk whey to naturally suckling rat pups between days 4-9 postnatal can down-regulate immune activation to a specific orally administered food antigen, ovalbumin, assessed by lymphocyte proliferation. In addition, non-specific down-regulation in the intestine was observed as assessed by the expression of MHC I. Treatment of rat pups with whey extract at the time of oral sensitisation to ovalbumin also resulted in an increased secretion of TGF-Œ≤ into the culture supernatant of spleen cells incubated with specific antigen. TGF-Œ≤ is an immuno-down-regulatory cytokine involved in tolerance induction. Immune modulation by extracts derived from milk whey could be of potential benefit for formula-fed and pre-term infants in reducing susceptibility to inappropriate activation to food antigens.","Penttila, I.

1541,Early-life exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ADHD behavior problems,"Importance: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are widespread urban air pollutants from combustion of fossil fuel and other organic material shown previously to be neurotoxic. Objective: In a prospective cohort study, we evaluated the relationship between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder behavior problems and prenatal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure, adjusting for postnatal exposure. Materials and Methods: Children of nonsmoking African-American and Dominican women in New York City were followed from in utero to 9 years. Prenatal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure was estimated by levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA adducts in maternal and cord blood collected at delivery. Postnatal exposure was estimated by the concentration of urinary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites at ages 3 or 5. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder behavior problems were assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist and the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised. Results: High prenatal adduct exposure, measured by elevated maternal adducts was significantly associated with all Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised subscales when the raw scores were analyzed continuously (N =233). After dichotomizing at the threshold for moderately to markedly atypical symptoms, high maternal adducts were significantly associated with the Conners Parent Rating Scale-Revised DSM-IV Inattentive (OR =5.06, 95% CI [1.43, 17.93]) and DSM-IV Total (OR= 3.37, 95% CI [1.10, 10.34]) subscales. High maternal adducts were positivity associated with the DSM-oriented Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Problems scale on the Child Behavior Checklist, albeit not significant. In the smaller sample with cord adducts, the associations between outcomes and high cord adduct exposure were not statistically significant (N=162). Conclusion: The results suggest that exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons encountered in New York City air may play a role in childhood Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder behavior problems. ¬© 2014 Perera et al.","Perera, F.

1542,Effect of gestational age (preterm or full term) on lipid composition of the milk fat globule and its membrane in human colostrum,"Human colostrum is the first milk secreted by the mother after birth and constitutes the ideal food for the newborn, because its chemical composition, rich in immunoglobulins, antimicrobial peptides, growth factors, bioactive lipids, and other important molecules, is perfectly adapted to the metabolic, digestive, and immunological immaturity of the newborn. An incomplete gestational period can affect the maturity of the mammary gland and its ability to secrete milk with the proper composition for the newborn's condition. Previous studies indicate that the mammary gland modulates the profiles of bioactive lipids present in the different phases of lactation from colostrum to mature milk. Given the key role played by the polar lipids (PL) (phospho- and sphingolipids) of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) in the immune system and cognitive development of the newborn, it is crucial to analyze whether the content and distribution of the PL are affected by gestation period. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the milk fat globule (MFG) and MFGM lipid compositions of human colostrum samples from 20 healthy preterm and full-term mothers. Lipid characterization using chromatographic techniques (gas chromatograph mass spectrometry and HPLC-evaporative light-scattering detection) revealed differences related to length of gestation in the profiles of lipid classes and fatty acid and triacylglyceride contents of colostrum. This comparative analysis leads to noteworthy outcomes about the changing roles of the PL, considering the preterm or full-term condition. We found a lack of correlation of some PL (such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine) with the delivery term","P√©rez-G√°lvez, A. and Calvo, M.

METHODS: We used retrospective chart review to identify 122 children with seizures who were younger than 4 years and followed for >or=6 months. Efficacy was evaluated on the basis of the occurrence and durability of seizure remission. Tolerability was based on parent- and patient-reported side effects. RESULTS: Seventy (57%) subjects achieved seizure remission, and 52 (43%) did not. In univariate analysis, those achieving seizure remission were more likely to have partial epilepsy, require lower maintenance doses of LEV, and have fewer than two seizures per month at initiation of the medication. Only seizure frequency at initiation of LEV remained significant in multivariate analysis. The median duration of seizure freedom (8.9 month) was not influenced by age, epilepsy type, gender, or pretreatment seizure frequency. The dose of LEV was the only significant predictor of the duration of seizure remission, with longer duration of seizure remission seen in those taking <30 mg/kg/day compared with those taking > 30 mg/kg/day (median, 12.8 months vs. 3 months","Perry, M.

1545,Early and late operation of cleft lip and intelligence quotient and psychosocial development in 3-7years,"Background: Early and late operations of the cleft lip represent exposure to general anesthesia during the first year of life. The early exposure to the anesthetics may influence long term neurological outcome. Timing of the operation may also influence the quality of life as babies with early repair might be accepted better by their families. Aims: The aim of the study was to compare outcomes between two groups of patients operated on for the cleft lip in the first year of life. Study design: Observational cohort study. Subjects: Early repair group included patients operated on in the first eight days of life and late repair group those operated on between 3 and 10. months. Outcome measures: Intelligence quotient (IQ) and psychosocial development of children who were operated on for cleft lip were compared at the age of 3-7. years. Results: No differences were found between early (n. =. 15) and late (n. =. 17) repair group in terms of IQ. In both IQ was within the normal range: 100.00 (SD 13.867), 98.76 (SD 10.109), respectively. Significantly better results in physical functioning (P. =. 0.042) and self-esteem (P. =. 0.014) concepts in early repair group were found. Conclusions: We compared outcomes of two groups of patients operated on for cleft lip in the first year of life.

1549,Maternal psychopathology and outcomes of a residential mother-infant intervention for unsettled infant behaviour,"Objective: Residential mother-infant intervention programmes for unsettled infant behaviour have been shown to be associated with positive child and maternal outcomes. Despite evidence of elevated rates of maternal psychopathology among residential unit populations, little is known about whether psychological disorders interfere with the effectiveness of such interventions. Method: Two cohorts (n 104 and 147, respectively) were recruited from a residential mother-infant intervention programme for unsettled infant behaviour. In study 1, mothers completed self-report questionnaires measuring depression, anxiety and parenting stress at three time points (admission, 1 month after discharge and 3 months after discharge). In study 2, mothers were interviewed using a structured clinical interview for depressive and anxiety disorders. In both studies, nurses recorded infant behaviours over the duration of the 5 day admission using 24 h behaviour charts. Results: Study 1 showed the intervention to be associated with significant improvements in child behaviours and in levels of maternal depression, anxiety and parenting stress. These improvements were evident for women who scored above the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale threshold for major depression during the admission, as well as for women in the normal range. Study 2 confirmed that the intervention was associated with significant improvements in infant behaviours. Infants of mothers with a depressive or anxiety disorder were less unsettled on admission, but improvements over the course of the admission were comparable for infants of women who had, or had not, experienced an anxiety or depressive disorder during the admission. Conclusions: These results show positive infant and maternal outcomes associated with a residential mother-infant intervention for unsettled infant behaviour, regardless of the women's psychiatric status on admission. This suggests that women with depression or anxiety disorders who also report unsettled infant behaviour, will benefit from referral to residential programmes. ¬© 2010 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists.","Phillips, J. and Sharpe, L. and Nemeth, D.",0,1244

However, there is also evidence that the transition to fatherhood can be complex and demanding and can lead to distress, anxiety and increased risk of depression. Objective this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of paternal postnatal depression, and to examine associations with a range of demographic and clinical factors. Methods a cross-sectional study design was used to collect primary data from 100 fathers, whose partner gave birth to an infant in the previous 12 months. Data were collected using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Results the prevalence of paternal postnatal depression was 12% using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale cut off score of 12 or above, when the cut off score was reduced to 9 or above the prevalence was 28%. The factors found to increase the risk of paternal postnatal depression included having an infant with sleep problems, a previous history of depression, a lack of social support, poor economic circumstances, not having paternity leave and not being married. Conclusion the results add to the growing body of evidence that paternal postnatal mental health is a significant public health issue, and indicates a need for assessment and support for fathers during this life stage. ¬© 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Philpott, L.

1552,Pacifier use in newborns: related to socioeconomic status but not to early feeding performance,"Aim: Mothers are often advised not to use pacifiers until breastfeeding has been well-established. This study determined the infant and social factors that were related to pacifier use during the first few days of life and whether it led to alterations in feeding performance. Methods: We enroled 51 full-term infants and their mothers at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in urban St. Louis, USA, in 2015. Before they were discharged the mothers completed a questionnaire, and infant feeding was assessed using a standardised assessment. Results: There were 24 (47%) infants who used a pacifier during the first few days of life and seven (29%) of these were exclusively breastfed. Pacifier use was less common among mothers who exclusively breastfed (p = 0.04). Pacifier use was more common among mothers whose income was less than 25 000 US dollars (p = 0.02), who were single (p = 0.002) and who did not have a college education (p = 0.03). No associations between pacifier use and feeding performance were observed. Conclusion: While lower socioeconomic status was related to pacifier use, feeding performance in the first few days of life was no different between those infants who did and did not use pacifiers after a full-term birth. ¬©2018 Foundation Acta P√¶diatrica.

1553,Supporting and enhancing NICU sensory experiences (SENSE): Defining developmentally-appropriate sensory exposures for high-risk infants,"Introduction: There is evidence to support the use of positive sensory exposures (music, touch, skin-to-skin) with preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), but strategies to improve their consistent use are lacking. The Supporting and Enhancing NICU Sensory Experiences (SENSE) program was developed to promote consistent, age-appropriate, responsive, and evidence-based positive sensory exposures for the preterm infant every day of NICU hospitalization. Methods: A systematic and rigorous process of development of the SENSE program included an integrative review of evidence on sensory exposures in the NICU, stakeholder feedback, expert opinion, and focus groups. Results: SENSE implementation materials consist of parent education materials, tailored doses of sensory exposures for each postmenstrual age, an infant assessment of tolerance, bedside logs and implementation considerations for integrating the SENSE program into the NICU. Discussion: Research is needed to evaluate the SENSE program as an implementation strategy and to assess its impact on parent and infant outcomes. ¬© 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Pineda, R. and Raney, M. and Smith, J.",0,1247
1554,Help me make it through the night: behavioral entrainment of breast-fed infants' sleep patterns,"The study objective was to investigate whether exclusively breast-fed infants could be taught to sleep through the night (defined from 12:00 AM to 5:00 AM) during the first 8 weeks of life. The design was short-term longitudinal, from the last trimester of pregnancy until the eighth week after birth. Twenty-six first-time parents and their newborn were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups (13 in each group). Treatment parents were instructed to offer a ""focal feed"" (between 10 PM and 12 AM) to their infants every night, to gradually lengthen intervals between middle-of-the-night feeds by carrying out alternative caretaking behaviors (eg, reswaddling, diapering, walking), and to maximize environmental differences between day and nighttime. All parents kept 72-hour diaries of their infants' feeding and sleeping patterns every week from birth to 8 weeks of age and rated their infants' temperament at birth and at 8 weeks. By 3 weeks, treatment infants showed significantly longer sleep episodes at night. By 8 weeks 100% of treatment infants were sleeping through the night compared to 23% of control infants. Treatment infants were feeding less frequently at night but compensated for the relatively long nighttime interval without a feed by consuming more milk in the early morning.

1555,Infant colic and maternal mental health: Nursing research and practice concerns,"Compared the mental health of 12 mothers who had infants with colic with 12 mothers of infants without colic. Colic was defined as infant fussing/crying of at least 2 hrs/day for at least 5 out of 7 days, a high-pitched and pain-sounding infant cry, and maternal report of infant inconsolability. Mental health was operationalized as scores on the Profile of Mood States and the SCL-90 (Revised). Mothers of infants with colic had multidimensional psychological distress. They reported more bodily dysfunction, fears, disordered thinking, depression, anxiety, fatigue, hostility, and impulsive thoughts and actions and had stronger feelings of personal inadequacy or inferiority. Findings verify both clinical and anecdotal claims of other researchers such as P. E. Thompson et al (see record 1989-02141-001).

1556,Infant cries: physiology and assessment,"It is generally agreed that the infant communicates physiological and psychological distress to caregivers by crying. Crying that is atypical in amount, intensity, duration, or quality could signal a physiological problem before the problem becomes obvious in other ways. Thus, cry analysis could soon become an important tool in early identification of infants at risk. To better assess neonatal cry sounds, nurses need some background in cry physiology. This article describes the evolution of cry sound production, presents the contemporary theories on the physiology of cry sound production, explains how cries are acoustically categorized and analyzed, and highlights the implications for infant caregivers.","Pinyerd, B.

1558,Human exposure of bisphenol a: Review of the urinary biomarker levels in the general population,"Bipshenol A (2,2'-bis-[4-hydroxyphenyl]propane) involved as monomer in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, is found in a wide variety of products including food packaging, baby bottles, food and drink cans or containers. Because of the migration of bisphenol A from the food container to the food itself, the dietary ingestion has been estimated to be the main source for the general population. The Human exposure is increasingly studied either through the determination of dietary intake or more frequently via the measurement of urinary biomarker. This chapter is reporting results from roughly 200 publications dedicated to the bisphenol A levels found in the urine of the worldwide general population and measured within the different Human biomonitoring (HBM) studies conducted in this last decade. The exposure of children and pregnant women, both known as particularly vulnerable populations, is separately examined. The impact of the different legislations implemented in different countries to reduce children's exposure on one hand and the different campaigns dedicated to the general public on the other hand, is not observed yet through temporal trend, likely because of the quite recent character of these actions. The advantages and the limitations of biomonitoring studies are also addressed, like the high within-person variability, the difficulties to access to reliable analytical techniques, the poor inter-study comparability, and the current need of longitudinal studies to establish links between BPA exposure and chronic diseases. ¬© 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

1559,Post traumatic stress disorder in children after tsunami disaster in Thailand: 2 years follow-up,"BACKGROUND: On December 26, 2004, the tsunami destroyed many families, communities, and residential areas. Adverse psychological impact on children and adolescents due to a natural disaster of this magnitude has never been reported in Thailand's history particularly as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). OBJECTIVE: Investigate clinical symptoms and develop a 2-year monitoring and intervention program for PTSD in children affected by the December 26, 2004 tsunami natural disaster The study period started six weeks after the event and was completed after two years. MATERIAL AND METHOD: One thousand six hundred and twenty five surviving students from two schools in Takuapa district, Phang-nga Province, were enrolled. Screening tests using Pediatric symptom checklists, Childhood depressive intervention (CDI), and Revised child impact of events scales (CRIES) were done. Psychiatric evaluations were done by child and adolescent psychiatrists. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was diagnosed using criteria from Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition. RESULTS: The prevalence of PSTD in the affected students were 57.3, 46.1, 31.6, 10.4, and 7.6% at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 1 1/2 years, and 2 years, respectively. The female: male ratio was 1.7:1. The peak age was 9-10 years old. Threatened situations were studied. Of the 176 students who risked their lives in the waves, 48 (27.3%) suffered from PTSD. Meanwhile, of the 1314 students who were not hit by the waves but were among affected friends and relatives, 42 students (3.1%) suffered from PTSD. The prevalence of PTSD in those hit by the waves were significantly higher than those who were not [p-value < 0.01, RR = 5.16 (4.04-.6.6)]. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PSTD in children who suffered from the tsunami disaster was as high as 57.3% at six weeks after the incident. It declined sharply at two years (7.6%) with the help of integrated welfare. The children continue to get financial, rehabilitation, and mental health support to prevent long-term adverse outcomes.","Piyasil, V. and Ketuman, P. and Plubrukarn, R. and Jotipanut, V. and Tanprasert, S. and Aowjinda, S. and Thaeeromanophap, S.",0,1253

1561,Cognitively-Based Compassion Training for parents reduces cortisol in infants and young children,"This study tests a group-based secular contemplative practice intervention, Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT), with parents of young children. We report on a randomized controlled preliminary efficacy study. Certified teachers administered CBCT for 20 hr across 8 to 10 weeks in two cohorts of parents with infants and young children. The intervention group was compared to a waitlist control group. Thirty-nine parents and their children, who ranged in age from 4 months to 5 years, were evaluated at pre- and postintervention (n = 25 intervention, n = 14 waitlist control) on hair cortisol concentration. Parents also completed self-administered questionnaires at both time points regarding demographics, physical symptoms of stress, parenting stress, self-compassion, and mindfulness. Children of parents in the CBCT group experienced significant decreases in cortisol at the postintervention assessment, as compared with the control group. However, parent cortisol and self-report measures did not significantly change other than a small effect on clinical levels of parenting stress. CBCT may be a positive new way to intervene with parents to lower infants‚Äô and young children's cumulative physiological stress. ¬© 2019 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health","Poehlmann-Tynan, J. and Engbretson, A. and Vigna, A.

1562,Sepsis and Oxidative Stress in the Newborn: From Pathogenesis to Novel Therapeutic Targets,"Sepsis is at present one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal population. Together with inflammation, oxidative stress is involved in detrimental pathways activated during neonatal sepsis, eventually leading to organ dysfunction and death. The redox cascade during sepsis is mainly initiated by IL-6 and IL-8 stimulation in newborns and includes multiple noxious processes, as direct cell damage induced by reactive oxygen species, activation of gene expression leading to amplification of inflammation and oxidative stress, and impairment of mitochondrial function. Once proinflammatory and prooxidant pathways are established as stimulated by causing pathogens, self-maintaining unfavorable redox cycles ensue, leading to oxidative stressrelated cellular damage, independently from the activating pathogens themselves. Despite antioxidant systems are induced during neonatal sepsis, as an adaptive response to an increased oxidative burden, a condition of redox imbalance favoring oxidative pathways occurs, resulting in increased markers of oxidative stress damage. Therefore, antioxidant treatment would exert beneficial effects during neonatal sepsis, potentially interrupting prooxidant pathways and preventing the maintenance of detrimental redox cycles that cannot be directly affected by antibiotic treatment. Among others, antioxidant agents investigated in clinical settings as adjunct treatment for neonatal sepsis include melatonin and pentoxifylline, both showing promising results, while novel antioxidant molecules, as edaravone and endothelin receptor antagonists, are at present under investigation in animal models. Finally, mitochondria-targeted antioxidant treatments could represent an interesting line of research in the treatment of neonatal sepsis.

1564,Effect of environmental phthalate exposure on pregnancy duration and birth outcomes,"Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of phthalate exposure on pregnancy duration and birth outcomes based on the Polish Mother and Child Cohort (REPRO-PL). Material and Methods: Phthalate exposure was determined by measuring 11 phthalate metabolites (mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), 3OH-mono-n-butyl phthalate (OH-MnBP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono. (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-hydroxy-iso-nonyl phthalate (MHiNP), mono-oxo-iso-nonyl phthalate (MOiNP), and mono-n-octyl phthalate (MOP)) in the urine collected from 165 mothers during the third trimester of pregnancy by high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The following measures at birth were considered: gestational age, birth weight, length as well as head and chest circumference. Results: Pregnancy duration was inversely associated with natural log concentrations (Œºg/g creatinine) of MEP (standardized regression coefficient (Œ≤) = -0.2, p = 0.04) after adjustment for a variety of confounders. Significant impact of MOiNP on head circumference (Œ≤ = -0.1, p = 0.05) was also observed. Conclusions: The study findings add further support to the hypothesis that phthalate exposure may be associated with shorter pregnancy duration and a decreased head circumference, and underscore importance of public health interventions to reduce that exposure.","Pola≈Ñska, K. and Ligocka, D. and Sobala, W. and Hanke, W.",0,1258

1569,"Infant regulation of the vagal ""brake"" predicts child behavior problems: A psychobiological model of social behavior","Cardiac vagal tone is a construct that describes the functional relationship between the brain stem and the heart. Cardiac vagal tone is measured by quantifying the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, a component of heart rate variability reflecting the functional output of vagal pathways on the heart. Although there is an extensive literature evaluating baseline vagal tone and its relation to behavior, the relation between individual differences in the ability to regulate cardiac vagal tone and behavior has been theoretically vague. This article introduces a theoretical model to explain the relation between vagal tone during steady states and vagal reactivity (i.e., the vagal brake) in response to environmental challenges. Based upon the proposed model, it was hypothesized that infants who had difficulties in regulating the vagal brake (i.e., decreasing cardiac vagal tone) during social/attention tasks would have difficulties developing appropriate social interactions requiring reciprocal engagement and disengagement strategies. Data from 24 infants are presented. The findings support the model and demonstrate that infants with difficulties in decreasing vagal tone during a social/attention task at 9 months of age had significantly more behavioral problems at 3 years of age. ¬© 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","Porges, S.

1574,The Adverse Cardiac Effects of Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate and Bisphenol A,"The ubiquitous nature of plastics has raised concerns pertaining to continuous exposure to plastic polymers and human health risks. Of particular concern is the use of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in plastic production, including di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and bisphenol A (BPA). Widespread and continuous exposure to DEHP and BPA occurs through dietary intake, inhalation, dermal and intravenous exposure via consumer products and medical devices. This article reviews the literature examining the relationship between DEHP and BPA exposure and cardiac toxicity. In vitro and in vivo experimental reports are outlined, as well as epidemiological studies which examine the association between these chemicals and cardiovascular outcomes.

1579,The stability and continuity of maternally reported and observed child eating behaviours and feeding practices across early childhood,"Given that many eating behaviours and food preferences develop early in childhood and track across childhood, adolescence and into adulthood, interest has grown in the developmental trajectory of these behaviours. The aims of this study were twofold. First, to explore whether maternal reports of child eating behaviour and feeding practices are validated by independent observations of these constructs. Second, to explore the continuity and stability of both maternally reported and independently observed child eating behaviours and maternal feeding practices during early childhood. Sixty-five mothers completed measures of their child‚Äôs eating behaviour and their own feeding practices and mother‚Äìchild dyads were observed during a family mealtime at approximately 3 and 4 years of age. Maternal reports of their child‚Äôs eating behaviours were validated by independent observations, however maternally reported feeding practices were not validated by observations of these behaviours. Maternally reported and independently observed child eating behaviours and parental feeding practices remained stable and showed continuity between 3 and 4 years of age, with the exception of child difficulty to feed and maternal pressure to eat which both significantly decreased over time. Findings provide an insight into the validity of maternal reports of fussy eating behaviour and parental feeding practices and the developmental trajectory of these behaviours across early childhood. ¬© 2018 by the authors.

1580,Does childbirth experience affect infant behaviour? Exploring the perceptions of maternity care providers,"Objective: High levels of childbirth interventions are known to increase risk of health complications for mother and infant, alongside having a negative impact upon maternal wellbeing. However less is understood about how childbirth experience may affect infant behaviour (e.g. how calm or unsettled an infant is). This study explores maternity care provider perceptions of how and why childbirth experience may affect infant behaviour. Design: A qualitative semi-structured interview study. Setting: Bristol, Swansea and West Wales, UK. Participants: 18 maternity care providers. Measurements and findings: A semi-structured interview schedule was developed to explore maternity care providers‚Äô perceptions of how maternal experience of childbirth could influence infant behaviour. Findings highlighted how maternity care providers perceived childbirth experience to sometimes impact positively or negatively on infant behaviour. A calmer birth and postnatal experience was believed to lead to a calmer infant, whilst physical and emotional stress was associated with more challenging infant behaviours such as crying and being unsettled. Pathways were perceived to be direct (pain and stress during birth might physiologically affect the infant) and indirect (birth was perceived to affect maternal wellbeing and subsequently her interactions with her baby). However, postnatal factors such as skin to skin, postnatal environment and emotional support were believed to mediate these impacts. Key conclusions: Birth experience was considered to affect infant behaviour. Promoting as positive a birth experience as possible, including postnatal care, was viewed as significant in supporting positive infant behaviours. Maternity care providers believed this could help facilitate bonding, attachment, and mother‚Äìinfant wellbeing in the postnatal period. Implications for practice: The findings highlight maternity care providers‚Äô views concerning supporting normal birth and protecting emotional wellbeing during birth and postnatally. Where interventions are necessary, ensuring a calm environment, and enabling normal postnatal behaviours such as skin to skin and breastfeeding were perceived as important. Midwives, it was claimed, need time to nurture mothers alongside providing physical care. Limitations: Participants were self-selecting and might therefore have been biased. ¬© 2019","Power, C. and Williams, C. and Brown, A.",0,1266
1581,Maternal perceptions of infant difficultness: The influence of maternal attitudes and attributions,"Explored some of the maternal factors that contribute to maternal perceptions of infant difficultness. 58 mothers of 6-wk-old infants completed free-response questionnaires to identify patterns of attribution for difficult behavior. In a 2nd study, maternal attributions, flexibility, and difficultness perceptions were assessed in 51 mothers followed longitudinally from 6 wks to 4 mo postpartum. Analyses showed that 4-mo perceptions of fussy/difficultness were predicted by maternal inflexibility in child rearing at 6 wks, over and above the contribution of 6-wk ratings of infant difficultness. This was true for initially difficult infants only. As for attributions, Ss who saw their 6-wk-old's difficult behavior as due to physical discomfort described their infant as fussy/difficult 3 mo later, whereas Ss who saw infant difficultness as reflecting infant resistance/disinterest later saw their infant as unpredictable.

Considerations regarding appropriate formula selection are also presented. METHODS: Common non-IgE mediated conditions were searched through common medical databases. Thorough review of available literature was then synthesised and critically appraised. RESULTS: Current understanding of immunological mechanisms of most non-IgE mediated conditions remains elusive. Most conditions are outgrown in childhood and have a good prognosis. Dietary modification for some conditions is important to ensure safety. They are not recommended in all situations due to potentially harmful consequences. CONCLUSION: Assessment of children with concerns regarding non-IgE mediated conditions requires a thorough history and is generally not supported by reliable diagnostic tests.

METHODS: We used a qualitative phenomenological approach. A total of 10 mothers and 8 fathers from a fishing village in Karachi, Pakistan were purposefully sampled and interviewed individually. A focus group was undertaken with four grandmothers (primary decision makers). Transcripts were independently reviewed using interpretive thematic analysis. RESULTS: A multigenerational approach was used in infant care, but mothers did not have a voice in decision-making. Parents connected breast milk to infant health, and crying was used as cue to initiate feeding. Participants perceived that newborns required early supplementation, given poor milk supply and to improve health. There were tensions between traditional (i.e., home) remedies and current medical practices. Equal importance was given to sons and daughters. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that social and cultural influences within families and the community must be considered in developing interventions to improve newborn health. Introducing non-breast milk substances into newborn diets may reduce the duration of exclusive or partial breastfeeding and increase risks to infant health.","Premji, S. and Khowaja, S. and Meherali, S. and Forgeron, R.",0,1270

Background: In Australia, there is a tiered system to support maternal, child and family health, which includes RPS. Design: Sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. Methods: Individual patient data were obtained from a random review of 10% of all medical records (n¬†=¬†300 of 3,011 admissions) of women with an infant of <12¬†months of age who were admitted to RPS in 2013. Following review of the medical records, qualitative data were collected via interviews with eight women who accessed RPS. Chi-square analysis and Student's t test were used to analyse quantitative data. Qualitative data were analysed using a descriptive interpretive approach. An integrative approach was taken in reporting the findings. Results: Women admitted to the RPS were on average 32¬†years of age, were Australian born (72%) and had a university qualification (40%), and most were employed. The majority of women were primiparous (60%) and had a vaginal birth (61%). Women with male infants were much more likely to be admitted to the RPS (58%) compared to the NSW male-to-female ratio (51.3% vs. 48.7%). Over 50% of women reported mental health issues with 27% having an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score ‚â•13 on admission. The primary reason women sought parenting support was for sleep and settling (83%). During their stay, services used by women included social workers (44%), psychologists (52%) and psychiatrists (4.5%). Conclusion: Women who access RPS report psychosocial and mental health issues. Services provided by RPS support women during this challenging early parenting period by providing multidisciplinary, holistic and peer support. Relevance to clinical practice: A high prevalence of mental health issues identified in this study indicated a need for ongoing training and support for RPS staff. Ensuring clinicians have the appropriate skill sets to best support their clientele will maximise the outcomes for women and families who access RPS during the early parenting period. ¬© 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Priddis, H. and Thornton, C. and Fowler, C. and Schmied, V. and Tooher, J. and Dickinson, M. and Dahlen, H.

1588,"Behavioral and physiological responsivity, sleep, and patterns of daily cortisol production in infants with and without colic","To describe the behavioral and physiological responses associated with colic, the responses of 20 2-mo-old infants with and 20 without colic were studied during a physical exam. Parents kept a diary of infant behaviors (including crying and fussing) for 3 days following the visit. Using M. A. Wessel et al (1954) criteria, colic was defined as fussing/crying for 3 hrs or more on each of the 3 days. Behavioral data showed that during the physical exam, colic Ss cried twice as much, cried more intensely, and were more inconsolable. Despite these behavioral differences, heart rate, vagal tone, and cortisol measures showed no appreciable difference in physiological responsivity for the 2 groups. At home, parents collected saliva cortisol samples at wakeup, midmorning, midafternoon, and evening for 2 days. In a finding similar to that shown by the laboratory data, the colic and control Ss did not have different levels of daily average cortisol. Results show no evidence of greater responsivity in the physiological substrate of difficult temperament for colic infants and are consistent with evidence of similarity in temperament once colic is resolved. At home, compared with control Ss, colic Ss did display a blunted rhythm in cortisol production.

1590,Prospective associations of appetitive traits at 3 and 12 months of age with body mass index and weight gain in the first 2 years of life,"Background: Appetitive traits in childhood such as food responsiveness and enjoyment of food have been associated with body mass index (BMI) in later childhood. However, data on appetitive traits during infancy in relation to BMI in later childhood are sparse. We aimed to relate appetitive traits in infancy to subsequent BMI and weight gain up to 24 months of age. Methods: Data of 210 infants from the Singapore GUSTO mother-offspring cohort was obtained. The Baby Eating Behavior Questionnaire (BEBQ) and the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) were administered to mothers when their offspring were aged 3 and 12 months respectively. Height and weight of offspring were measured at ages 3, 6, 9,12,15,18 and 24 months. The association of appetitive traits with both BMI z-score and weight gain were evaluated using multivariate linear regression. Results: Food responsiveness at 3 months was associated with higher BMI from 6 months up to 15 months of age (p < 0.01) and with greater weight gain between 3 and 6 months of age (p = 0.012). Slowness in eating and satiety responsiveness at 3 months was significantly associated with lower BMI at 6 months (p < 0.01) and with less weight gain between 3 to 6 months of age (p = 0.034). None of the appetitive traits at 12 months were significantly associated with BMI or weight gain over any time period. Conclusion: Early assessment of appetitive traits at 3 months of age but not at 12 months of age was associated with BMI and weight gain over the first two years of life. ¬© 2015 Quah et al.","Quah, P.

1591,Emergency department utilization in the Texas Medicaid emergency waiver following Hurricane Katrina,"Objective: To estimate the enrollment and emergency department (ED) utilization in TexKat, the Texas Medicaid emergency waiver implemented following Hurricane Katrina. Data Sources: Individual-level enrollment and utilization data from the 2005 Medicaid Analytic Extract. Study Design: Descriptive analysis is performed on variables that describe enrollment levels, the demographic characteristics of enrollees, and the most common diagnoses in ED visits. A Poisson regression model is also employed to quantify the factors related to an enrollee's probability of having an ED visit and the average number of ED visits. Principal Findings: There were 44,246 individuals enrolled in TexKat in 2005. Roughly 13% of these enrollees had at least one ED visit during the sample period, with one quarter of these individuals having more than one visit. Across all enrollees the most common diagnosis was ""other upper respiratory infection,"" but there were significant differences in diagnosis patterns across racial/ethnic groups. The regression analysis suggests little difference in ED utilization across genders, but significant contrasts across racial/ethnic and age groups. Conclusions: As very little is known about Medicaid emergency waivers, our analysis may provide important information to policymakers who have to react quickly following a disaster. Our findings may help providers estimate potential increases in ED utilization and prepare for relatively common diagnoses. Furthermore, the analysis across racial/ethnic groups may help government officials identify important areas for outreach among vulnerable populations.","Quast, T. and Mortensen, K.",0,1275
1592,The Link Between Infantile Colic and Migraine,"Infantile colic is a self-limiting disorder of excessive infant crying or fussiness that peaks at 6¬†weeks of age and typically improves by 3¬†months of age. The etiology of infantile colic has yet to be definitively elucidated, but there is increasing research to support its relationship to migraine. The aims of this review are to present recent research investigating the connection between infantile colic and migraine. The importance of identifying this connection is useful in reducing invasive and potentially harmful investigations and to identify age appropriate pharmacologic interventions that would be safe in this population. ¬© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Qubty, W. and Gelfand, A.

1594,Vagal Regulation in Breastfeeding Infants and Their Mothers,"Consistent with the gustatory‚Äìvagal hypothesis, vagal stimulation during breastfeeding may contribute to infants' physiological regulatory development independent of caregiving effects. This study examined whether breastfeeding predicted 6-month-old infants' (N¬†=¬†151) and their mothers' vagal regulation during the face-to-face still-face (FFSF). Although breastfed and nonbreastfed infants showed expected vagal withdrawal during the Still-Face episode, only breastfed infants showed continued withdrawal during the reunion episode, suggesting greater physiological mobilization to repair the interaction. Breastfeeding mothers showed higher vagal tone than nonbreastfeeding mothers at baseline, suggesting greater capacity for regulation, and throughout the FFSF, suggesting calmer states. Breastfeeding effects were independent of maternal sensitivity. Findings suggest that infants' and mothers' physiological regulation may be shaped by breastfeeding independently of associated social factors. ¬© 2016 The Authors.

1595,Infant and mother sleep patterns during 4th postpartum week,"Using modified Barnard and Eyres (1979) Sleep/Activity Records, 44 mothers recorded diurnal sleep and awake times for themselves and their infants during the 4th week postpartum. Independent two-way analyses of variance, using a two-factor design (3a x 2b), compared data from each mother and each infant. Independent variables were (a) parity groups (mothers feeding their first, second, or third infant) and (b) feeding method (breast vs. bottle). A statistically significant difference (Œ± = 05) was apparent between breast-fed and bottle-fed babies regarding the number of awakenings and the hours of night sleep, with breast-fed babies awakening more and sleeping less at night. But there was no statistically significant difference in the hours of total sleep diurnally. Mothers exhibited corresponding differences in sleep patterns, with a statistically significant increase in night waking for breast-feeding mothers. Infants in this study averaged 14.6 hr of sleep in 24 hr, which is in contrast to the 15.5 to 17.3 hr of sleep commonly reported in nursing texts based on studies from the 1960s.","Quillin, S. I.

1596,Interaction between feeding method and co-sleeping on maternal-newborn sleep,"Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that breastfed newborns spend more time awake than bottle-fed newborns, breastfeeding mothers have more fragmented sleep than bottle-feeding mothers, and mother-newborn sleeping arrangements may affect the sleep/wake pattern of mother-newborn pairs. Objective: To address the unsolved question of whether there is an interaction between type of feeding and sleeping arrangements that affects postpartum sleep during the 4th postpartum week. Design: Correlational, two-way design using feeding method and location of newborn at night as independent variables, and sleep patterns as the dependent variables. Setting: Patient's home during 4th week after giving birth. Patients/Participants: First-time mothers and their newborns (n = 33). Main outcome measures: Amount of total sleep, amount of night sleep, number of night awakenings, and number of sleep periods in 24 hours using a modified version of the self-report sleep instrument by Barnard and Eyres. Results: Breastfed newborns had less total sleep per day than bottle-fed newborns, and breastfeeding mothers had more sleep periods in 24 hours than bottle-feeding mothers. Breastfeeding mothers slept more than bottle-feeding mothers when co-sleeping, but bottle-feeding mothers' sleep was unaffected by location of newborn. Average total sleep for 4-week-old newborns was about 14 hours daily. Conclusions: More sleep was obtained when breastfeeding mothers slept with the newborn. Methods or devices that allow breastfeeding mothers and newborns to sleep next to each other in complete safety need to be developed.","Quillin, S. I. M. and Glenn, L. L.",0,1279
1598,Evidence that the periaqueductal gray matter mediates the facilitation of panic-like reactions in neonatally-isolated adult rats,"Plenty of evidence suggests that childhood separation anxiety (CSA) predisposes the subject to adult-onset panic disorder (PD). As well, panic is frequently comorbid with both anxiety and depression. The brain mechanisms whereby CSA predisposes to PD are but completely unknown in spite of the increasing evidence that panic attacks are mediated at midbrain's dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG). Accordingly, here we examined whether the neonatal social isolation (NSI), a model of CSA, facilitates panic-like behaviors produced by electrical stimulations of DPAG of rats as adults. Eventual changes in anxiety and depression were also assessed in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and forced-swimming test (FST) respectively. Male pups were subjected to 3-h daily isolations from post-natal day 2 (PN2) until weaning (PN21) allotting half of litters in individual boxes inside a sound-attenuated chamber (NSI, n = 26) whilst siblings (sham-isolated rats, SHAM, n = 27) and dam were moved to another box in a separate room. Non-handled controls (CTRL, n = 18) remained undisturbed with dams until weaning. As adults, rats were implanted with electrodes into the DPAG (PN60) and subjected to sessions of intracranial stimulation (PN65), EPM (PN66) and FST (PN67-PN68). Groups were compared by Fisher's exact test (stimulation sites), likelihood ratio chi-square tests (stimulus-response threshold curves) and Bonferroni's post hoc t-tests (EPM and FST), for P<0.05. Notably, DPAG-evoked panic-like responses of immobility, exophthalmus, trotting, galloping and jumping were markedly facilitated in NSI rats relative to both SHAM and CTRL groups. Conversely, anxiety and depression scores either did not change or were even reduced in neonatally-handled groups relative to CTRL, respectively. Data are the first behavioral evidence in animals that early-life separation stress produces the selective facilitation of panic-like behaviors in adulthood. Most importantly, results implicate the DPAG not only in panic attacks but also in separation-anxious children's predispositions to the late development of PD. ¬© 2014 Quintino-dos-Santos et al.","Quintino-dos-Santos, J.

1599,Interactive Effects of Infant Gestational Age and Infant Fussiness on the Risk of Maternal Depressive Symptoms in a Nationally Representative Sample,"Objective: To examine the interactive effects of gestational age and infant fussiness on the risk of maternal depressive symptoms in a nationally representative sample. Methods: Our sample included 8200 children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort. Gestational age categories were very preterm (VPT, 24‚Äì31 weeks), moderate/late preterm (MLPT, 32‚Äì36 weeks) and full term (FT, 37‚Äì41 weeks). Maternal depressive symptoms (categorized as nondepressed/mild/moderate-severe), from the modified Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Questionnaire, and infant fussiness (categorized as fussy/not fussy) were assessed at 9 months from parent-report questionnaires. We examined the interactive effects of infant fussiness and gestational age categories and estimated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of maternal depressive symptoms using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Infant fussiness interacted with gestational age categories in predicting maternal depressive symptoms (P = .04), with severity varying by gestational age and infant fussiness. Compared with mothers of VPT infants without fussiness, mothers of VPT infants with fussiness had greater odds of mild depressive symptoms (aOR, 2.32","Quist, M. and Kaciroti, N. and Poehlmann-Tynan, J. and Weeks, H.

1602,Maternal adverse childhood experiences and infant development,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the prenatal and postnatal mechanisms by which maternal adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) predict the early development of their offspring, specifically via biological (maternal health risk in pregnancy, infant health risk at birth) and psychosocial risk (maternal stress during and after pregnancy, as well as hostile behavior in early infancy). METHODS: Participants were 1994 women (mean age = 31 years) and their infants, who were recruited in pregnancy as part of a prospective longitudinal cohort from 2008 to 2010. Pregnant women completed self-report questionnaires in pregnancy and postpartum related to psychosocial risk and a questionnaire about hostile behavior when their infant was 4 months of age. Health risk in pregnancy and infant health risk at birth were obtained from health records. Mothers completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire when infants were 12 months of age. RESULTS: Path analysis revealed that the association between maternal ACEs and infant development outcomes at 12 months operated through 2 indirect pathways: Biological health risk (pregnancy health risk and infant health risk at birth) and psychosocial risk (maternal psychosocial risk in pregnancy and maternal hostile behavior in infancy). CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial risks in pregnancy, but not in early infancy, contribute to the transmission of vulnerability from maternal ACEs to child development outcomes in infancy via maternal behavior. Maternal health risk in pregnancy indirectly confers risk from maternal ACEs to child development outcomes at 12 months of age through infant health risk. Maternal health and psychosocial well-being in pregnancy may be key targets for intervention. ¬© 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.","Racine, N. and Plamondon, A. and Madigan, S. and McDonald, S. and Tough, S.",0,1284
1603,The effects of Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) on the fuss and crying time of colicky infants,"Background: Infantile colic is a common complaint in the first few weeks of the neonate's life. Due to its unknown etiology, there is not a specific therapy for this disease. However, various therapeutic options are recommended for reducing the pain and restlessness in the affected infants. Skin-to-skin contact via Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is known to increase the pain threshold and it seems to be a proper method for the care of these infants. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of KMC on infantile colic. Methods: This case-control study was performed from March 2012 to March 2013. Subjects consisted of 55 exclusively breastfed infants ageing between 15-60 days with excessive fuss and crying who were referred to the Children's Clinic of Ayatollah Rohani Hospital in Babol, North of Iran. The neonates who weighed less than 2500 grams or had been diagnosed with genetic or clinical disorders were excluded from this study. The studied infants were subjected to KMC for at least 2 hours a day. Standard questionnaires were completed through interviews and Barr Scale was also conducted. The collected data were analyzed by SPSS software V.11.5 and T-test and a P-value of less than 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: According to the results of this study, the fuss and crying time of the infants before the KMC was 2.21¬±1.54 hours per day while it reduced to 1.16¬±1.3 hours per day after the implementation of KMC (p=0.001). Conclusion: KMC could be practiced at home as a simple and safe method of diminishing the fussiness and crying time in colicky infants.","Rad, Z. A. and Mojaveri, M. H. S. and Pasha, Y.

1605,"Parental Mental Health, Fathers' Involvement and Bedtime Resistance in Infants","Background: Around the age of 6 months, difficulties in settling to sleep and frequent night awakenings are generally occurring in 20 to 30% of infants. According to the transactional model parental factors can play a significant role in influencing infant sleep development. The purpose of the current study was to explore the combined effect of infants' factors (temperament and sleep onset problems), and parental factors (parental mental health in terms of post-partum affective disorders, consistent bedtime routines and fathers' involvement at bedtime), on infant bedtime difficulties (e.g. fussing, crying or protesting), including both maternal and paternal perspectives. Methods: Sixty Italian intact two-parent families of infants (34 boys and 26 girls) ageing from 8 to 12 months (M = 10.73, SD = 2.54) were enrolled in the study. The parents filled out self-report questionnaires to measure the aforementioned variables. To investigate which infant and parental factors predicted infants' bedtime difficulties, two multiple linear regressions (MR), one for fathers and one for mothers, and relative weight analyses (RWA) were conducted. Results: With regard to infants' bedtime difficulties reported by fathers (R2 =.35) they were explained by infant involvement in constant bedtime routines (Œ≤ = -.35, p =.030) and paternal involvement at bedtime (Œ≤ = -.45, p =.007). Instead infants' bedtime difficulties reported by mothers (R2 =.32) were explained by minutes the child taken to fall asleep (Œ≤ =.24, p =.04), infant involvement in constant bedtime routines (Œ≤ = -.31, p =.01) and bedtime paternal involvement (Œ≤ = -.27, p =.05). Conclusions: The main results of this study emphasized the protective role of consistent bedtime routines and bedtime paternal involvement in reducing infants' bedtime difficulties perceived both from mothers and fathers. Future research could help to raise awareness and improve understanding of the familial influences on children's sleep, providing recommendations for educating families, school professionals, healthcare providers, and the general public on risk and protective factors that could play a meaningful role in infants and children's developing sleep patterns. ¬© 2019 The Author(s).","Ragni, B. and De Stasio, S. and Barni, D. and Gentile, S. and Giampaolo, R.",0,1286
1606,Use of music during physical therapy intervention for an infant with Erb's palsy: A single-subject design,"Evidence supporting the use of music during pediatric physical therapy intervention is limited. The purpose of this single-subject design was to evaluate the effects of music on patient progress, the amount of crying during therapy, and parent satisfaction with physical therapy services. The subject was an infant girl with Erb's palsy who participated in this study from age 8 months to age 20 months. An A-B-A withdrawal single-subject design was used. The patient's progress was assessed by using the T.I.M.E.TM The amount of crying was documented in the Crying Log. A parent satisfaction questionnaire was administered three times over the course of the study. The subject's progress in the music intervention period increased on three of five primary subtests of the T.I.M.E.TM The amount of crying decreased and parent satisfaction increased when music was played during therapy. Music may be used by pediatric physical therapists to decrease the patient's crying, increase parent satisfaction, and possibly to increase the child's rate of progress. Further research conducted with a group of infants and toddlers may help generalize these findings to a wider patient population.

1607,Family life 1 year after infantile colic,"Objective: To determine the persistence of family psychological characteristics associated with infantile colic. Design: A 1-year follow-up survey of families with colicky infants was carried out. The family interview was used to evaluate the psychological factors of colicky and control families. Participants: A total of 59 families with a colicky infant and 58 control familes were enrolled in the initial evaluation in the population- based study. On the basis of a structured diary of the infant's crying, filled in by the parents, 3 groups of families were formed: severe colic group (n=36), moderate colic group (n=23), and control group (n = 58). The families were interviewed when the infants were 2 and 12 months old. The Beavers Timberlawn Family Evaluation Scale and the Oulu Family Assessment Scale were used. Thirty-two families (89%) from the severe colic group, 17 (74%) from the moderate colic group, and 49 (84%) from the control group participated in the 1-year assessment. Results: At the 1-year assessment, the structural pro-file of the families did not differ between the groups. However, families in the severe colic group had more difficulties in communication, more unresolved conflicts, more dissatisfaction, and greater lack of empathy than families in the other groups. Furthermore, there was less flexibility in both colic groups than in the control group. During the follow-up period, coalition between parents in the moderate colic group became stronger compared with the first assessment, and the atmosphere improved significantly in all 3 study groups. However, the amount of empathy decreased in the severe colic group. Conclusions: Our study shows that certain family characteristics associated with severe infantile colic persist. Families in the moderate colic group coped nearly as well as families in the control group. The family mood had improved a lot in all families when the infant was 1 year old.","R√§ih√§, H. and Lehtonen, L. and Korhonen, T. and Korvenranta, H.",1,1288

Organized family structures and strong parental coalitions were seen more often in the severe colic and control groups than in the moderate group. The atmosphere in the severe group was less optimistic than the moderate and control groups, with more unresolved conflicts. Families who successfully resolved earlier developmental phases in their own relationships were most likely to cope with the colicky infant.

Nadolol, a nonselective beta-blocker with potential dosing advantages and a better safety profile than that of other beta-blockers, has been studied as an alternative therapeutic option. Our objective was to characterize the efficacy and safety of oral nadolol in the treatment of proliferating IHs. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Hospital for Sick Children between February 2010 and April 2012 in patients treated with nadolol for proliferating IHs causing functional impairment or cosmetic disfigurement. The primary outcome was the percentage involution measured independently by two assessors who scored changes in the extent of IHs by comparing serial photographs using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), on which 5 mm represented 10% change. Results Forty-four patients treated with nadolol for IHs with adequate photographic documentation were identified. The median age at presentation was 4.5 months (interquartile range 1.5-7.9 mos). There was a mean improvement of 91.8 ¬± 11.1%. At least 50% improvement was noted in 42 (95%) patients and 75% improvement in 39 (89%) patients. The mean time to 50% and 75% improvement was 2.9 and 3.7 months, respectively. Analysis of variance showed that younger age at the time of treatment start was associated with a higher mean VAS score (% involution) (p < 0.05). Treatment duration (mean 9.5 ¬± 5.6 months) had no significant effect on VAS score. Test of interobserver correlation showed good agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.86, p = 0.001). Conclusions Oral nadolol is efficacious in patients with problematic IHs. Further large-scale prospective comparative studies are warranted to compare nadolol with other beta-blockers. ¬© 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Randhawa, H. K. and Sibbald, C. and Garcia Romero, M.

1618,Celiac disease: evaluation of the diagnosis and dietary compliance in Canadian children,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize the clinical features at presentation as well as the associated disorders, family history, and evaluation of compliance with a gluten-free diet in children with celiac disease from across Canada. STUDY DESIGN: All members (n = 5240) of the Canadian Celiac Association were surveyed with a questionnaire. Of the 2849 respondents with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease, 168 who were < 16 years old provided the data reported here. RESULTS: The mean age when surveyed was 9.1 +/- 4.1 years, and 58% were female. Median age at diagnosis was 3.0 years with a range of 1 to 15 years. Presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (90%), weight loss (71%), diarrhea (65%), weakness (64%), nausea/vomiting (53%), anemia (40%), mood swings (37%), and constipation (30%). Almost one third of families consulted > or = 2 pediatricians before confirmation of the diagnosis. Before the recognition of celiac disease, other diagnoses received by these children included anemia (15%), irritable bowel syndrome (11%), gastroesophageal reflux (8%), stress (8%), and peptic ulcer disease (4%). A serological test was performed to screen for celiac disease in 70% of those in this population. Eight percent had either type 1 diabetes mellitus or a first-degree relative with celiac disease. Almost all respondents (95%) reported strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, and 89% noted improved health. Reactions after accidental gluten ingestion developed in 54% of the children between 0.5 and 60 hours after ingestion with a median of 2.0 hours. Reactions included abdominal discomfort (87%), diarrhea (64%), bloating (57%), fatigue (37%), headache (24%), and constipation (8%), and most displayed > 1 symptom. Although most adjusted well to their disease and diet, 10% to 20% reported major disruptions in lifestyle. Twenty-three percent felt angry all or most of the time about following a gluten-free diet. Only 15% avoided traveling all or most of the time, and during travel, 83% brought gluten-free food with them all of the time. More than half of the families avoided restaurants all or most of the time. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents found it extremely difficult to locate stores with gluten-free foods, and 27% reported extreme difficulty in finding gluten-free foods or determining if foods were free of gluten. Sixty-three percent of the respondents felt that the information supplied by the Canadian Celiac Association was excellent. Gastroenterologists provided excellent information to 44%, dietitians to 36%, and the family physician to 11.5%. When asked to select 2 items that would improve their quality of life, better labeling of gluten-containing ingredients was selected by 63%, more gluten-free foods in the supermarket by 49%, gluten-free choices on restaurant menus by 49%, earlier diagnosis of celiac disease by 34%, and better dietary counseling by 7%. CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, children with celiac disease present at all ages with a variety of symptoms and associated conditions. Delays in diagnosis are common. Most children are compliant with a gluten-free diet. A minority of these children experience difficulties in modifying their lifestyles, and gluten-free foods remain difficult to obtain.","Rashid, M. and Cranney, A. and Zarkadas, M. and Graham, I.

A growing number of factors that modulate the infant's immunophysiology have also been identified in breastmilk. We suggest that this early immunomodulation via breastmilk is vital for infant health and may explain the epidemiological data indicating that breastmilk reduces the risk of immunoinflammatory conditions in infancy and also later in life.

Methods: This open-labelled randomized clinical trial was conducted among 465 term neonates who were randomly assigned to one of three groups: music group, hammock group and control group. The music intervention was given for a cumulative duration of at least 4 h a day with one stretch of at least 1 h. In the hammock group, babies were put to sleep inside the Indian hammock and were swung gently until they sleep, and were allowed to sleep in it, until they wake up. For the control group, routine pre-discharge counselling was given. All parents were provided a cry log and were instructed to record the log of cry events and duration. The primary outcome measure was occurrence of infantile colic episode as defined by ROME IV criteria. The infants were followed up from birth until the age of 3.5 months, and the cry log was collected during each follow-up visit. Results: Of the 435 term neonates who completed follow-up, 59 infants developed infantile colic (13.6%). The prevalence of infantile colic in the control group, music group and the Indian hammock group was 25.6%, 5.4% and 9.6% respectively","Ravikumar, S. and Srinivasaraghavan, R. and Gunasekaran, D. and Sundar, S. and Soundararajan, P.",1,1300
1622,Oral dextrose for analgesia in neonates during nasogastric tube insertion: a randomised controlled trial,"AIM: This study aims to determine if oral dextrose solution can mitigate the pain response to nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion in neonates. METHODS: The study was a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial. One hundred and fifty consecutive neonates were randomised into three groups to receive 25% dextrose (D25), or 10% dextrose (D10) or placebo (distilled water). An NGT was inserted after giving 2‚ÄâmL of one of the solutions orally. Pain response was assessed using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), and the duration of cry was noted within 60‚Äâs of the intervention. Total PIPP score, duration of cry, change in heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) were compared among the three groups. RESULTS: Neonates who received D25 had significantly lesser pain response to NGT insertion in terms of lower PIPP score (P < 0.05) and duration of cry (P = 0.001) compared to D10. There was a significantly smaller increase in heart rate and decrease in SpO2 (P < 0.05). In comparison with placebo, D10 significantly decreased duration of cry (P < 0.05) but not PIPP score. CONCLUSION: Oral D25 was effective in reducing the pain response during NGT insertion in neonates when compared with oral D10 and placebo. Oral D10 was not found to have a potent analgesic effect for the same.","Ravishankar, A. and Thawani, R. and Dewan, P. and Das, S. and Kashyap, A. and Batra, P. and Faridi, M. M.",0,1301

1628,Excessive infant crying: The impact of varying definitions,"Objective. To assess the impact of varying definitions of excessive crying and infantile colic on prevalence estimates and to assess to what extent these definitions comprise the same children. Methods. Parents of 3345 infants aged 1, 3, and 6 months (response: 96.5%) were interviewed on the crying behavior of their infant in a Dutch cross-sectional national population-based study. We computed the prevalence of excessive crying according to 10 published definitions regarding parent-reported duration of infant crying and the parents' experience. We measured concordance between pairs of definitions by Cohen's Œ∫ (agreement adjusted for chance agreement). Results. Overall prevalence rates of excessive crying varied strongly between definitions, from 1.5% to 11.9%. They were always highest in 1-month-old infants. Concordance between definitions was only excellent (Œ∫ >0.75) if they were closely related, such as crying for >3 hours/day for >3 days/week for the preceding 2 or 3 weeks. Concordance between less closely related definitions was much weaker. Concordance between definitions that were based on duration and on parental experience was mostly poor (Œ∫: 0.17-0.53 for infants aged 1 and 3 months). Conclusions. Different definitions of excessive crying lead to the inclusion of very dissimilar groups of infants. We recommend presenting study results using clearly described definitions, preferably concerning both duration of crying and parental distress. This may improve the comparability of studies on the cause and treatment of excessive infant crying. The impact of the method of data collection on this comparability needs additional study.","Reijneveld, S. A. and Brugman, E. and Hirasing, R. A.",1,1304
1630,"Effects of minimal acupuncture in children with infantile colic - A prospective, quasi-randomised single blind controlled trial","Background: Colic causes crying in 10-30% of infants and is one of the primary reasons parents seek health care. Treatments are generally not totally effective and some cause side effects. In this study we aimed to test the effect of fight needling (minimal acupuncture) on crying. Methods: Forty children (median six weeks of age) with excessive crying unresponsive to conventional therapies, were recruited from 21 Child Welfare Clinics within an area of western Sweden, and quasi-randomised to control or light needling treatment. Parents were unaware of which group their child was assigned to. Children were given fight needling acupuncture on one point (LI4) on both hands for approximately 20 seconds on four occasions, or received the same care except needling. Parental assessment questionnaires were used pre- and post-treatment to assess crying intensity, frequency, duration of crying and pain related behavionr throughout the day in six hour periods. Results: Light needling resulted in a significant reduction in the rated crying intensity (assessed by a numeric rating scale, 0 to 10). For example, during the morning time period 0600-1200 hours, the median (range) rated crying intensity changed from 6 (1 to 9) pre-treatment to 2 (0 to 5) post-treatment (P=0.002), in the light needling group. The corresponding ratings for the children in the control group was 6 (0 to 10) and 5 (0 to 10) respectively. The difference between the groups was significant (P=0.016). There were also significant differences between the groups for the afternoon (1200-1800 hours), and evening (1800-midnight) time periods. Pain related behaviour like facial expression, was also significantly less pronounced in the light needling group as compared to the control group post-treatment, (P=0.027). The parents rated the light needling as more effective in improving symptoms than the control group (P<0.001). Conclusion: Four treatments with light needling on one point in the hand may alleviate crying and pain related behaviour without any noted side effects.","Reinthal, M. and Andersson, S. and Gustafsson, M. and Plos, K. and Lund, I. and Lundeberg, T. and Ros√©n, K.

1631,Gastrointestinal symptoms of infantile colic and their change after light needling of acupuncture: A case series study of 913 infants,"Background: Infantile colic is a common painful clinical condition associated with signs of distended intestines and an increase in colon peristalsis. However, clinical documentation of observed gastrointestinal functions in the condition is still lacking. Even though the ailment is common, no clear treatment guidelines exist. While acupuncture with minimal stimulation has been shown to be effective in reducing crying behaviour of infants suffering from colic, the documented effect of acupuncture on gastrointestinal function in children with infantile colic is scarce. This case series study aims to document the symptoms of routinely rated gastrointestinal function and the changes in these symptoms after minimal acupuncture in a larger group of children with infantile colic.Methods: This study included 913 infants with normal weights, and lengths at birth. The infants' mean age was 5.4 weeks when the observations started, and had colic symptoms since two weeks after birth. Light needling stimulation of the acupuncture point LI4 was performed for 10-20 seconds bilaterally on a daily basis for a mean of 6.2 consecutive days. A questionnaire with verbal rating scales for the parents' evaluation was used before and after the treatment period.Results: Before treatment the infants were assessed by the parents in terms of 'often have inflated stomachs' (99%) and 'seldom drool' (76%), 'regurgitate' (53%) and 'belch' (62%). Moreover, the reported frequency of defecation was 5-8 times per day (64%), with a yellowish-green colour (61%) and with a water-thin consistency (74%). After treatment, the variables of inflated stomachs, drooling and regurgitating were systematically changed, and rated by the parents as occurring 'sometimes' while belching was rated as occurring 'often' and the frequency of defecation was reduced to 1-4 times/day with a mustard yellow colour and a gruel-like consistency. The parents also rated their impression of the infants' general colic symptoms including crying behaviour as much ameliorated in 76% of the cases.Conclusion: The results of the present study show that minimal acupuncture at LI4 in infantile colic is an effective and easy treatment procedure that, furthermore, is reported to be without serious side effects. ¬© 2011 Reinthal et al","Reinthal, M. and Lund, I. and Ullman, D. and Lundeberg, T.",0,1306
1632,Effective pain reduction for multiple immunization injections in young infants,"BACKGROUND: Infants experience undue pain with multiple immunization injections. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and parental acceptance of a simple combination pain reduction intervention for infants receiving multiple immunization injections. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, clinical trial. SETTING: Academic hospital-based primary care center. PARTICIPANTS: Infants receiving their 2-month immunizations, consisting of 4 injections (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine, inactivated poliovirus vaccine, Haemophilus influenzae b conjugate and hepatitis B vaccine [Comvax], and heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [Prevnar]). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group for administration of 4 injections. The intervention group received sucrose and oral tactile stimulation (with a pacifier or a bottle) and were held by their parents during immunization. The control group did not receive these interventions (standard practice). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Blinded assessment of audiotaped crying, heart rate, parent preference for future use of the injection technique, and nurse-rated ease of vaccine administration. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen infants (mean +/- SD age, 9.5 +/- 2.0 weeks) participated. The median (25th-75th percentile range) first cry duration was 19.0 (5.8-62.8) seconds for the intervention group compared with 57.5 (31.0-81.5) seconds for the control group (P =.002). Parents of the intervention group reported a stronger preference for future use of the injection procedure. For intervention vs control, the median (25th-75th percentile) parent preference visual analog scale score was 97.0 (82.0-100.0) vs 44.0 (5.0-77.2) (P<.001) (100 indicates definitely prefer). Nurse-rated ease of vaccine administration was equivalent for both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combining sucrose, oral tactile stimulation, and parental holding was associated with significantly reduced crying in infants receiving multiple immunization injections. Parents stated a strong preference for future use of this method, and nurses found the intervention injection technique easy to apply.","Reis, E. C. and Roth, E. K. and Syphan, J. L. and Tarbell, S.

1633,Poor infant inhibitory control predicts food fussiness in childhood - A possible protective role of n-3 PUFAs for vulnerable children,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) children are more impulsive towards a sweet reward and have altered feeding behavior in adulthood. We hypothesized that early life inhibitory control predicts feeding behaviors later on in childhood, and the consumption of n-3 PUFAs during infancy may protect IUGR children from developing problematic feeding behaviors. 156 children had information on the Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ) at 18 months, Food Frequency Questionnaire at 48 months and Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire (CEBQ) at 72 months. There was a significant negative correlation between inhibitory control at 18 months and food fussiness at 72 months. A GLM model predicting food fussiness at 72 months showed significant interaction between n-3 PUFAs, inhibitory control and IUGR, with higher intakes associated with decreased risk for fussiness in IUGR children with poor inhibitory control. Deficits in early inhibitory control predict later food fussiness, and higher intakes of n-3 PUFAs in infancy may protect IUGR children from developing such behavior later. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Reis, R.

1637,The effect of creating an artificial night on physiological changes in preterm infants,"Introduction Preterm infants are exposed to irregular light for several weeks or months in the Neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU). This lack of maternal entrainment, the exposure to irregular extrauterine lighting and care in the nursery may contribute to the disturbances in body temperature, sleep and physiological changes that are commonly experienced by preterm infants. Materials and Methods This is a randomized clinical trial dual group study, 38 preterm infants (gestational age of 30-34 weeks) due to prematurity hospitalized at NICU of Ghaem Hospital, Iran, were evaluated within 10 days. Infants were divided into two groups of 1200-1700 and 1701-2200g based on the weight and the weight of each group were randomized into artificial night (dark period was from 19 to 7 during incubator was covered with linen cloth & light period was from 7 to 19 removed the cover) and control groups (continuous lighting). Mothers & infants through questionnaires, interviews, observation & document completion, changes in physiologic & weight before entering the study & then physiologic changes twice a day. Data were analyzed using SPSS version16 software. Results The two groups were matched in terms of other variables. Mean gestational age was (31.39+1.39) weeks in both groups, mean weight at study entry in period light of the (1415.8+ 263.46) and (1471.6 + 244.47) was in continuous lighting. The difference in oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, respectively, higher and lower in the intervention group than the control group. Result of the statistical analysis of repeated measures suggests that the difference between the two groups was significant (P<0.05(. Conclusion The results of this study indicate that the effect of artificial night on physiological stabilization of preterm infants is positive. In order to create a favorable and efficient environment to help better growth, prevent complications of prematurity and impaired circadian rhythms in infants, pay more attention to the care conditions of infants is recommended.","Reyhani, T. and Aemmi, S.

1638,Continuous wavelet analysis of postprandial EGGs suggests sustained gastric slow waves may be slow to develop in infants with colic,"Background: Electrogastrography in conjunction with Fast Fourier transform has limited success in detecting low grade abnormalities in gastric electrophysiological activity owing to the non-stationarity of the signal. Analysis by continuous wavelet transform is suitable for non-stationary signals and was used to analyse EGG activity in babies with and without colic. Methods: Thirty minute postprandial EGG recordings were obtained from 23 sleeping breast-fed infants with clinically validated recurrent colic and 26 breast-fed non-colicky infants. Continuous wavelet transform analysis (CWT) identified three principal frequency components. The mean, standard deviation, and the number of frequency maxima that fell below one standard deviation from the mean were determined for each infant and each frequency. Key Results: Three component frequencies in the ranges 1.4‚Äì2.5¬†cpm, 2.5‚Äì4.0¬†cpm, and 4.0‚Äì15¬†cpm were found in all EGGs. Pairwise comparisons of the characteristics of each of the frequency ranges by univariate analyses showed significant differences between colicky and non-colicky subjects only in the number of maxima in the mid range of frequencies that lay below one standard deviation from the mean. However, CWT based on all frequencies allowed discrimination of the EGGS of colicky from non-colicky babies on a basis of number of frequency maxima below one standard deviation from the mean in the midrange of frequencies and in the mean and standard deviation in the low range of frequencies that was likely a harmonic of the midrange. Conclusions & Inferences: CWT allowed distinction of EGG signals from colicky and healthy babies. The results indicate that colic may result from tardiness in the establishment of coherent propagation of the gastric slow wave in colicky babies. ¬© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Reynolds, G.

1639,Temporary strict maternal avoidance of cow's milk and infantile colic,"Infant colic is a common problem characterized by excessive crying and fussing. We examined whether colic symptoms of exclusively breast-milk-fed infants would be improved by temporary strict maternal avoidance of cow's milk. This study is analytic and experimental. Sixtysix subjects were recruited during winter of 2006 from a clinic in Isfahan, Iran. Breast-milk-fed infants with ""colic"", age 3-6 months and to be in otherwise good health were referred by pediatricians. The intervention was 1 week period of strict maternal avoidance of cow's milk while they continued exclusive breast-milk-feeding. All infants showed improvement in distressed behavior (crying and fussing) during intervention. The total recorded crying and fussing time was reduced by an average of 31%. A significant difference was found in cry and fuss time between first and last 2 days of intervention (P = 0.000). Cow's milk proteins may play an etiologic role in colic. We propose that a brief intervention with strict maternal avoidance of cow's milk may be an effective treatment for colic in some breast-milk-fed infants. ¬© 2009 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

Participants were 361 linked triads of birth parents, adoptive parents, and adopted children. We examined direct and indirect pathways from marital hostility to child sleep problems via hostile parenting. Mothers' marital hostility at 9 months was associated with child sleep problems at 4.5 years. Fathers' marital hostility at 9 months evidenced an indirect effect on child sleep problems at 4.5 years via fathers' hostile parenting at 27 months. Findings were significant even after controlling for genetic influences on child sleep (i.e., birth parent internalizing disorders). The findings suggest targets for prevention and intervention programs that are potentially modifiable (e.g., hostile parenting, marital hostility), and inform theory by demonstrating that relations among marital hostility, hostile parenting, and child sleep problems are significant after accounting for genetic influences. ¬© 2012 American Psychological Association.","Rhoades, K.

Participants were 361 linked triads of birth mothers, adoptive parents, and adopted children who were 9 (T1) and 18 (T2) months old across the study period. Results indicated an indirect effect from T1 marital hostility to T2 toddler anger/frustration via T2 parental harsh discipline. Results also indicated that the association between marital hostility and toddler anger was moderated by birth mother anger/frustration. For children whose birth mothers reported high levels of anger/frustration, adoptive parents' marital hostility at T1 predicted toddler anger/frustration at T2. This relation did not hold for children whose birth mothers reported low levels of anger/frustration. The results suggest that children whose birth mothers report elevated frustration might inherit an emotional lability that makes them more sensitive to the effects of marital hostility. ¬© 2011 American Psychological Association.","Rhoades, K.

1642,Infant Colic Represents Gut Inflammation and Dysbiosis,"Objective: To dissect potential confounding effects of breast milk and formula feeding on crying + fussing, fecal calprotectin, and gut microbiota in babies with colic. We hypothesized that infant colic is associated with gut inflammation linked to intestinal dysbiosis. Study design: A nested case-control design of 3 of our studies was used to analyze clinical and laboratory data at presentation, comparing babies with colic with controls. All investigators other than the biostatistician were blinded during data analysis. Subjects were recruited based on their age and crying + fussy time. We screened 65 infants, 37 with colic, as defined by Barr diary (crying + fussing time >3 hours daily), who were compared with 28 noncolicky infants. Results: Fecal calprotectin was elevated in babies with colic. For each mode of infant feeding (breast milk, formula, or breast + formula), infants' fecal calprotectin was higher in babies with colic. Infants with colic had similar levels of fecal alpha diversity (richness) when compared with controls, and alpha diversity was lower in breast-fed babies. Beta diversity at the phylum level revealed significant differences in microbial population. A phylum difference resulted from reduced Actinobacteria (95% of which are Bifidobacilli) in babies with colic. Species significantly associated with colic were Acinetobacter and Lactobacillus iners. Conclusions: Colic is linked with gut inflammation (as determined by fecal calprotectin) and dysbiosis, independent of mode of feeding, with fewer Bifidobacilli.

1643,Development and validation testing of a short nutrition questionnaire to identify dietary risk factors in preschoolers aged 12-36 months,"Background: Although imbalances in dietary intakes can have short and longer term influences on the health of preschool children, few tools exist to quickly and easily identify nutritional risk in otherwise healthy young children. Objectives: To develop and test the validity of a parent-administered questionnaire (NutricheQ) as a means of evaluating dietary risk in young children (12-36 months). Design: Following a comprehensive development process and internal reliability assessment, the NutricheQ questionnaire was validated in a cohort of 371 Irish preschool children as part of the National Preschool Nutrition Survey. Dietary risk was rated on a scale ranging from 0 to 22 from 11 questions, with a higher score indicating higher risk. Results: Children with higher NutricheQ scores had significantly (p < 0.05) lower mean daily intakes of key nutrients such as iron, zinc, vitamin D, riboflavin, niacin, folate, phosphorous, potassium, carotene, retinol, and dietary fibre. They also had lower (p < 0.05) intakes of vegetables, fish and fish dishes, meat and infant/toddler milks and higher intakes of processed foods and non-milk beverages, confectionery, sugars and savoury snack foods indicative of poorer dietary quality. Areas under the curve values of 84.7 and 75.6% were achieved for 'medium' and 'high' dietary risk when compared with expert risk ratings indicating good consistency between the two methods. Conclusion: NutricheQ is a valid method of quickly assessing dietary quality in preschoolers and in identifying those at increased nutritional risk. ¬© 2015 Niamh Rice et al.","Rice, N. and Gibbons, H. and McNulty, B.

1646,Positive maternal interaction behavior moderates the relation between maternal anxiety and infant regulatory problems,"Regulatory problems in infancy are determined by different risk factors. This study aims to examine how psychosocial risk factors are connected, and how they impact the early regulatory ability of 3-month-old infants. In a sample of 57 mother-infant dyads, maternal anxiety and infant crying, sleeping and feeding habits were assessed. As a possible moderator, the role of positive maternal behavior was analyzed by videotaping face-to-face interactions. During the interaction, interactive stress was provoked with the face-to-face still-face paradigm (FFSF). Thus, this study differentiated between the effects of maternal behavior in both an ordinary play context, as well as a stressful interaction context. Results revealed that the relation between maternal anxiety and infant regulatory problems in crying and sleeping varied as a function of positive maternal engagement in stressful situations. However, a significant moderation effect influencing infant feeding problems could not be demonstrated. These findings stress the importance of positive maternal interaction behavior in at least some parts of regulatory adjustment of at-risk infants. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Richter, N. and Reck, C.",0,1319
1647,"A Moderated Mediation Model of Maternal Perinatal Stress, Anxiety, Infant Perceptions and Breastfeeding","This study examined a moderated mediation model of relations among maternal perinatal stress/anxiety, breastfeeding difficulties (mediator), misperceptions of infant crying (moderator), and maternal breastfeeding duration to understand risk factors for early breastfeeding termination. It was hypothesized that more breastfeeding difficulties would mediate the relation between greater prenatal stress/anxiety and shorter breastfeeding duration, and that perceptions of response to infant crying as spoiling would moderate the relation between more breastfeeding difficulties and reduced breastfeeding duration. Additionally, it was hypothesized that participants who breastfed through 6 months would demonstrate less postnatal stress/anxiety and there would be a positive relation between fewer breastfeeding difficulties and less postnatal stress/anxiety through 6 months. Participants included 94 expectant mothers at 33-37 weeks gestation and 6 months (¬±2 weeks) postpartum. Greater prenatal anxiety was associated with shorter breastfeeding duration. Results presented are the first to document negative relations between prenatal (as opposed to postnatal) anxiety and breastfeeding duration (as opposed to frequency or other indicators) in a U.S. sample. Future studies should seek to replicate findings in a more diverse sample and compare findings from clinical and non-clinical samples. Studies may also wish to explore the effects of anxiety prevention/intervention on breastfeeding duration.","Riedstra, J. P. and Aubuchon-Endsley, N. L.",0,1320
1648,Experimental manipulation of emotion regulation changes mothers' physiological and facial expressive responses to infant crying,"This study examined whether instructing mothers to apply emotion regulation strategies can change mothers' perception and reactivity to infant crying in an experimental within-subject design. Perception of crying, skin conductance level (SCL), facial expressivity, and intended caregiving responses to cry sounds were measured in mothers (N‚Äâ=‚Äâ101, M‚Äâ=‚Äâ30.88 years) who received suppression, reappraisal, and no emotion regulation instructions. Reappraisal resulted in lower SCL during exposure to crying and a less negative perception of crying compared to the suppression condition. In contrast, suppression resulted in increased facial expressions of sadness compared to the control condition. Thus, simple instructions on how to reframe thoughts about crying can change mothers' perception of and reactivity to crying.","Riem, M. M. E. and Karreman, A.",0,1321
1650,Links between maternal feeding practices and children's eating difficulties. Validation of French tools,"The main objectives of the present study were to validate measures of young children's eating difficulties and maternal feeding practices in a French sample, as well as to assess the links between these practices and children's eating difficulties. Mothers (n= 502) of French children aged 20-36. months completed four questionnaires that were validated using a Structural Equation Modelling approach. Links between children and maternal components were investigated using a PLS regression. The Children's Eating Difficulties Questionnaire yielded a 4-dimension solution: Neophobia, Pickiness, Low Appetite and Low Enjoyment in food. The Feeding Style Questionnaire assessed three dimensions: Authoritarian, Authoritative and Permissive Styles. The Feeding Strategy Questionnaire, designed to evaluate strategies used by mothers to make their child taste rejected foods, resulted in four factors: Coercion, Explanation, Contingency and Preference. The Questionnaire relating to Parental Motivations when buying food for children presented a 6-dimension solution: Convenience, Weight-control, Natural, Health-concern, Preference and Price. The factors associated positively with the four dimensions of the Children's Eating Difficulties Questionnaire were on the one hand Permissive Style and Practices to fulfil child's desires, and on the other hand Authoritarian Style, Contingent and Coercive Practices aimed at forcing children to taste rejected foods. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Rigal, N. and Chabanet, C. and Issanchou, S. and Monnery-Patris, S.",0,1322
1651,Is harsh caregiving effective in toddlers with low inhibitory control? An experimental study in the food domain,"The aim of our study is to evaluate the validity of the ""Caregiving √ó Temperament Paradigm"" in the food domain. In this study, two prototypes of caregiving control have been contrasted: Harsh (forceful measures to curve the child's behavior) versus Gentle control (supportive measures to direct the child's behavior). In food domain, the most effective control to help a child to overcome initial dislike is repeated exposure. Our first objective was to test whether the repeated exposure displayed in a gentle context has a more benefical effect on dislike shifting than the one displayed in a harsh context. Our second objective was to assess whether this effect was moderated by a temperamental characteristic (child's inhibitory control). A randomized experimental protocol was used in day care-centers, involving 98 children aged 21-41 months. Children were asked to consume an initially rejected target food on five occasions either with a Gentle or a Harsh instruction. Children's dislike for the target food was assessed via intake before and after the familiarization phase. Inhibitory control level was measured in 78 of these children using validated questionnaire. Four groups were created: Instructions (Gentle vs Harsh) √ó Inhibitory control (Lower vs Higher). After the familiarization phase, the consumption of the target food increased in all groups, but with a higher increase in children with high Inhibitory control with Gentle instruction, than for children with low Inhibitory control with Harsh instruction, the two other groups being in between. Our data fit a model of cumulative effects, and show that both gentle control strategies and high inhibitory control in children contribute to regulate disgusts experienced in some feeding contexts. ¬© 2016.","Rigal, N. and Rubio, B. and Monnery-Patris, S.",0,1323

Reach Out and Read (ROR) is a widely used model of office-based early literacy promotion. We hypothesized that exposure to ROR and other variables such as reading as part of a bedtime routine positively correlate with caregiver-child reading frequency. Methods This is a cross-sectional study based on a convenience sample of caregivers at 8 ROR-Milwaukee sites, which serve predominantly low-income populations in Milwaukee. On the basis of results of previously validated questionnaires, odds ratios were calculated to determine which variables are significantly associated with caregivers' reading to children 0 to 2 (rarely), 3 to 6 (often), and 7 (daily) days per week.

Parental questionnaire data show that Colombian babies cry significantly more in the morning, during the day, and at night compared to Finnish babies, who cry more in the evening. Colombian babies' cries were significantly more angry and high-pitched and lasted longer than the cries of Finnish babies. Colombian mothers reported significantly more frequent feelings of worry and fear in response to the cries than Finnish mothers, who more often viewed them as a means of communication. Among mothers who wanted more help because of excessive crying (about 20% of mothers in both countries), crying was described as more powerful, high-pitched, and complaining, and made them more irritated and exasperated than other mothers.

1655,Probiotic intervention in the first months of life: Short-term effects on gastrointestinal symptoms and long-term effects on gut microbiota,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether probiotics administered for 6 months postnatally affect gastrointestinal symptoms, crying and the compositional development of the gut microbiota through infancy. METHODS: The study comprised of 132 newborns whose mothers were randomized to receive placebo or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (ATCC 53103) before delivery. The treatments of mothers/infants continued for 6 months postnatally. A specific symptom chart was used to monitor gastrointestinal symptoms and infant's crying during the 7th and the 12th weeks of life. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to establish the Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus/Enterococcus, Bacteroides and Clostridium counts in fecal samples at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. RESULTS: Numbers of different types of stools, vomits and crying time were comparable between the groups during the 7th and the 12th weeks of life. Dominant microbiota consisted of bifidobacteria throughout the study. At 6 months, there were less clostridia in faeces in the placebo compared with the probiotic group (P = 0.026), whereas after long-term follow-up at 2 years, there were less lactobacilli/enterococci and clostridia in faeces in the probiotic group than in the placebo group (P = 0.011 and P = 0.032, respectively), reflecting the impact of clostridia as a marker of microbiota succession in healthy infants. CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic administration in the first months of life was well tolerated and did not significantly interfere with long-term composition or quantity of gut microbiota. ¬© 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Rinne, M. and Kalliom√§ki, M. and Salminen, S. and Isolauri, E.",0,1327
1656,Group home caregivers' comfort levels regarding physical resistance during oral hygiene care,"The purpose of this study was to investigate perceived comfort levels, behaviors, and barriers reported by group home caregivers who provide oral hygiene measures to consumers with special health care needs (SHCN) who physically resist the care. A 24-item survey was sent to 884 caregivers employed at six care facilities in Iowa. Bivariate analyses and logistic regression models were used to analyze the data (alpha = 0.05). The overall response rate was 52%. An analysis of the data indicated that caregivers who felt more comfortable providing oral hygiene for consumers who physically resisted the care experienced a higher frequency of consumers not opening their mouths (p = 0.0003), pushing the caregiver away (p = 0.0002), moving their heads uncontrollably (p = 0.0004), spitting at (p = 0.0099), hitting and/or kicking the caregiver (p = 0.0011). Furthermore, these caregivers provided weekly direct care for a greater number of consumers (p = 0.0044), received oral care training from their current facility (p = 0.0424), brushed the teeth of uncooperative consumers at least 75% of the time (p < 0.0001), and felt ""somewhat comfortable to very comfortable"" flossing their teeth (p < 0.0001). The caregivers' comfort level in providing oral hygiene measures to those consumers with SHCN who physically resist the care appears to be significantly associated with their training and experience working with this population. ¬© 2015 Special Care Dentistry Association and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Risma, K.

1659,Sudden infant death syndrome: cry characteristics,"OBJECTIVE: To acoustically evaluate the cries of SIDS infants and compare these cry features to a group of healthy term (HT) infants, as well as previously published results for SIDS infants. METHODS: Pain-induced crying episodes were collected from four infants during the first weeks of life that later died of SIDS. Temporal and spectral features of each crying episode were characterized based on measures of cry duration, cry fundamental frequency (F0), and cry formant frequencies (F1 and F2). RESULTS: The SIDS infants were found to produce cries with longer duration compared to HT infants. The cries of SIDS infants also differed from HT infants in regard to the absolute difference in F2-F1 frequency. CONCLUSIONS: The acoustic features considered in the present study support the contention that the cries of SIDS infants are reflective of atypical respiratory-laryngeal control. Although research of this nature is rare, there is evidence to suggest an acoustic profile of crying that is specific to SIDS.","Robb, M. P. and Crowell, D. H. and Dunn-Rankin, P.",0,1330

In general, remarkable similarity was found across infants with regard to the distributional occurrence of the cry features. Regardless of the overall duration of an infant's crying episode, pauses tended to occur most frequently, followed by expiratory cries and inspiratory cries. Findings are discussed in terms of the notion of volitional control over crying and diagnostic implications for unhealthy infants.

Six percent of the samples yielded instances of either harmonic doubling (HD), fundamental frequency (F0) shift, or biphonation (Bp). These spectrographic features relate to short duration changes in F0, reflecting alterations in vocal fold state characteristics. The HD and Bp segments were perceptually judged to be harsh, while F0 shift closely reflected pitch breaks. The frequency of occurrence of the three acoustic features suggests that they are normally occurring phonatory events in normal children's vocal patterns.","Robb, M. P. and Saxman, J. H.",0,1332

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The pain-elicited cries of 12 newborn infants were recorded within the first 2 weeks following birth. A complete crying episode was analyzed for each infant and acoustically measured for the number and duration of inspiratory and expiratory cry components. These components were then used to estimate the respiratory rate of infant crying, as well as the inspiratory and expiratory phase composition of the cry respiratory cycles. RESULTS: Acoustic analysis revealed that the average rate of crying was 57 breaths min‚Åª¬π with the inspiratory phase contributing 27% to the overall respiratory cycle. However, considerable variability was found across infants with distinct patterns of respiration associated with high versus low respiratory rates. CONCLUSIONS: The respiratory patterns associated with pain cries is highly variable and may be associated with variations in stress-arousal, strength of emotional expression, and overall fitness. This study supports the notion that the respiratory activity surrounding newborn infant crying is unique to the type of cry sampled.","Robb, M. P. and Sinton-White, H. and Kaipa, R.",0,1333

Methods: This study is a community-based, cross-sectional survey of 170 children and their parents. Traumatic events were assessed by the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory - Parent Report Revised using criteria for potentially traumatic events in young childhood outlined by the Zero to Three working group. HRQOL of young children was measured using the 97-item Infant/Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire, and psychosocial health was measured using the Child Behavior Checklist 1.5-5. Results: One hundred and twenty-three (72 %) of children had experienced at least one type of trauma event. Children who had been exposed to 1-3 types of trauma and those exposed to 4 or more types of trauma had significantly worse HRQOL and psychosocial health than children not exposed to trauma. Significant effect sizes between children exposed to low levels or high levels of traumatic events and children not exposed to trauma ranged from small to large. Conclusions: Exposure to traumatic events in early childhood is associated with less positive HRQOL and psychosocial health. Cumulative trauma exposure led to significant effects in outcome variables in this population. Interventions to decrease trauma exposure and to reduce significant stress in early childhood associated with exposure to trauma may be appropriate strategies for preventing negative health conditions throughout the life span. ¬© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Roberts, Y.

1665,"Health, emergency department use, and early identification of young children exposed to trauma","Background Childhood trauma is an important public health problem with financial, physical health, and mental health repercussions. Emergency departments (EDs) are often the first point of contact for many young children affected by emotionally or psychologically traumatic events (e.g., neglect, separation from primary caregiver, maltreatment, witness to domestic violence within the family, natural disasters). Study Objectives Describe the prevalence of physical health symptoms, ED use, and health-related problems in young children (birth through 5 years) affected by trauma, and to predict whether or not children experiencing trauma are more likely to be affected by health-related problems. Methods Community-based, cross-sectional survey of 208 young children. Traumatic events were assessed by the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory - Parent Report Revised. Child health symptoms and health-related problems were measured using the Caregiver Information Questionnaire, developed by ORC Macro (Atlanta, GA). Results Seventy-two percent of children had experienced at least one type of traumatic event. Children exposed to trauma were also experiencing recent health-related events, including visits to the ED (32.2%) and the doctor (76.9%) for physical health symptoms, and recurring physical health problems (40.4%). Children previously exposed to high levels of trauma (four or more types of events) were 2.9 times more likely to report having had recently visited the ED for health purposes. Conclusions Preventing recurrent trauma or recognizing early trauma exposure is difficult, but essential if long-term negative consequences are to be mitigated or prevented. Within EDs, there are missed opportunities for identification and intervention for trauma-exposed children, as well as great potential for expanding primary and secondary prevention of maltreatment-associated illness, injury, and mortality.","Roberts, Y.

However, the consumption of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) seems to be protective for this population, improving inhibitory control and behavioral reactivity. We investigated whether the presence of the A allele of rs8887 SNP (PLIN4 gene), known to be associated with increased sensitivity to the consumption of n-3 PUFAs, interacts with fetal growth influencing inhibitory control. 152 five-year-old children were genotyped and performed the Stop Signal Task (SSRT). There was a significant interaction between birth weight and the presence of the A allele on SSRT performance, in which lower birth weight associated with poorer inhibitory control only in non-carriers. These results suggest that a higher responsiveness to n-3 PUFAS protects small for gestational age children from developing poor response inhibition, highlighting that optimizing n-3 PUFA intake may benefit this population. ¬© 2018","Rodrigues, D.

Lower baseline testosterone (T) among men is generally associated with more sympathetic and nurturant responses to infant stimuli. The effect of exposure to infant crying on men‚Äôs levels of T, however, is not well understood. The present study aimed to measure men‚Äôs T responses to high and low levels of infant crying. Design. Changes in fathers‚Äô (n =¬†18) and non-fathers‚Äô (n =¬†28) salivary T levels from baseline were measured in response to caring for an infant simulator programmed to cry often (high-demand condition) or infrequently (low-demand condition) during a 20-min caregiving simulation. Results. Men exposed to low-demand conditions exhibited significant T reductions from baseline, whereas men in high-demand conditions exhibited increases in T. Compared to men who displayed decreases in T following the caregiving simulation, men who displayed increases in T provided less sensitive care. Conclusions. Results suggest a potential role of high levels of crying in provoking physiological reactions among men that may set the stage for hostile or aggressive responses. More research is needed to illuminate contextual factors that contribute to men‚Äôs variable responses to infant crying. ¬© 2019, Copyright ¬© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Roellke, E. and Raiss, M. and King, S. and Lytel-Sternberg, J. and Zeifman, D.

1678,"Breastfeeding duration and its relation to weight gain, eating behaviours and positive maternal feeding practices in infancy","Research examining the relationship between breastfeeding and infant weight has generated conflicting results. Few studies account for significant covariates and many suffer methodological problems such as retrospective self-report. The current study aimed to investigate relationships between breastfeeding duration, infant weight and eating and positive maternal mealtime behaviours, whilst overcoming many of the limitations of previous research. Eighty-one women on low-risk maternity units gave informed consent and were visited at home at 1-week, 1-, 6- and 12-months postpartum. Infants included 45 males and 36 females (mean birth-weight 3.52¬†kg [SD 0.39]). Mothers and infants were weighed and measured and feeding information was recorded at each visit. Infant weight was converted to a standard deviation score (SDS), accounting for age and sex. Mothers reported infant eating behaviours at 12-months using the Children's Eating Behaviour Questionnaire and were observed feeding their infants solid food at home at 6- and 12-months. Partial correlations (covariates: maternal age, education, BMI, smoking during pregnancy, household income, infant birth weight SDS and age introduced to solid foods) revealed negative associations between breastfeeding duration and 1- to 6- and 1- to 12-month weight gain, and 6- and 12-month weight. Breastfeeding duration was also associated with a slower rate of infant eating and greater observed maternal vocalisations, appropriateness and sensitivity. Results support a dose-response relationship between breastfeeding and infant weight and suggest that breastfeeding may encourage the development of obesity-protective eating behaviours through learning to attend to internal hunger and satiety signals. Future research should investigate whether relationships between slowness in eating and weight extend to satiety responsiveness after infancy. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Rogers, S.

1680,Association between childhood migraine and history of infantile colic,"Importance: Infantile colic is a common cause of inconsolable crying during the first months of life and has been thought to be a pain syndrome. Migraine is a common cause of headache pain in childhood. Whether there is an association between these 2 types of pain in unknown. Objective: To investigate a possible association between infantile colic and migraines in childhood. Design, Setting, and Participants: Acase-control study of 208 consecutive children aged 6 to 18 years presenting to the emergency department and diagnosed as having migraines in 3 European tertiary care hospitals between April 2012 and June 2012. The control group was composed of 471 children in the same age range who visited the emergency department of each participating center for minor trauma during the same period. A structured questionnaire identified personal history of infantile colic for case and control participants, confirmed by health booklets. A second study of 120 children diagnosed with tension-type headaches was done to test the specificity of the association. Main Outcomes and Measures: Difference in the prevalence of infantile colic between children with and without a diagnosis of migraine. Results: Children with migraine were more likely to have experienced infantile colic than those without migraine (72.6% vs 26.5%","Romanello, S. and Spiri, D. and Marcuzzi, E. and Zanin, A. and Boizeau, P. and Riviere, S. and Vizeneux, A. and Moretti, R. and Carbajal, R. and Mercier, J.

1681,Proton pump inhibitors in pediatrics: evaluation of efficacy in GERD therapy,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is defined as the passage of gastric contents into the esophagus. It occurs in healthy infants and can be considered physiological process. Uncomplicated GER can present with recurrent vomiting or regurgitation without any other symptoms and is usually managed by educating, reassuring, and guiding the parent without other intervention. GER disease (GERD) refers to the appearance of troublesome symptoms or complications (erosive esophagitis, ulceration, Barrett's esophagus) and may warrant acid suppression. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective pharmacologic agents available for the treatment of children with GERD. In the pediatric practice only omeprazole, lansoprazole and esomeprazole are available over the first year of life. The empiric use in infants with nonspecific symptoms (excessive crying, regurgitation, feeding refusal, chronic cough) is frequent without randomized controlled study. Our paper will focus on the correct indications, dosages, duration of treatment and safety of PPI use in pediatric population.","Romano, C. and Chiaro, A. and Comito, D. and Loddo, I. and Ferrau, V.",0,1346
1683,An assessment of the duration of breastfeeding in north-eastern Poland,"In 2005, the European Commission presented a report on the current situation associated with the protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding in 29 European countries. According to the report, exclusive breastfeeding was unDertaken by 71% of the mothers in Poland. We concluded that an attempt shall be made to verify these data values. The aim of our survey was to assess the duration of breastfeeding and identify the potential medical and social factors affecting this parameter in Poland. We surveyed 427 women aged 18 to 40 from Northeastern Poland. The duration of breastfeeding and the presence of selected potential factors that may affect this parameter were assessed in 591 children. The mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding was 4.73 months with breastfeeding being initiated in 97.87% and continued beyond 12 months (following the introduction of complementary foods) in 32.49 % of the children. In our region, nearly all mothers attempt to breastfeed. Exclusive breastfeeding is continued by 75.46% and 29.27% of the mothers by 3 and 6 months of the baby's life.

1686,Head position preference in the human newborn: A new look,"Head position preference was studied in 20 awake newborns who differed in terms of delivery (vaginal or Caesarean) and sex. Ss were placed supine on a custom-built platform to reduce the effects of gravity and asymmetries in trunk posture and skull shape. A global and a specific scoring method were used, the infants being in State 3 (quiet wakefulness) or 4 (active wakefulness, excluding crying). Delivery and sex did not account for differences in head position. The head turned more often to the right and was maintained longer in this position during State 3, regardless of scoring method. The maintenance of the head in midline was comparable in duration to that reported for infants at 2‚Äì3 mo when using the global scoring method. This suggests that the neural mechanisms responsible for attaining and maintaining a midline position are present at birth, but are not functionally expressed due to a lack of adequate power in the antigravity muscles of the neck.

1687,Conspicuousness of distasteful prey affects the strength and durability of one-trial avoidance learning,"Previous work has shown that domestic chicks learn more effectively to avoid distasteful prey if the prey is conspicuously colored. It is not known whether conspicuousness affects strength of learning directly or whether differences in learning stem from differences in initial encounter rate. In 3 experiments using a 1-trial avoidance learning procedure, domestic male chicks were allowed a single exposure to red or white distasteful beads on a red or white background. Avoidance learning was stronger when the ""prey"" was conspicuous than when it was cryptic. Learned avoidance of a conspicuously colored bead persisted for longer than learned avoidance of a cryptically colored bead. Thus, conspicuousness directly affected both the strength of initial learning and the duration of memory for a noxious stimulus.

Thus, children's categories must allow variability in coordinate properties, while preserving the relational component labeled by motion verbs and prepositions. The current study asks if preverbal infants notice within-category distance changes (e.g., height of a jump) more than across-category distance changes, (e.g., over versus under). Results suggest that categorical changes are most important, which has implications for how children carve a continuous world into categories that coincide with language. ¬© Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Roseberry, S. and G√∂ksun, T. and Hirsh-Pasek, K. and Golinkoff, R.

This study examined the open-ended survey responses of parents describing which food textures were ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù for their child with DS. The open-ended responses from the parents about textures and foods they considered ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù for their child (n = 157) were coded into 26 texture categories. Chewy and firm were more frequently listed as ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù textures by parents. Textures found to be cited more frequently as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù textures included creamy, crispy/crunchy, dissolvable, mushy, puree, smooth, and soft. Age influenced the citation of specific textures. As age increased, crispy/crunchy, dry, and hard were more likely to be listed as ‚Äúeasy‚Äù while lumpy, mushy, and gooey/soggy/wet were less likely be listed as ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù For ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù textures, as age increased, juicy was more likely to be listed as ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù while the textures of creamy, dry, lumpy, and tender were less likely to be ‚Äúdifficult.‚Äù While this research provides information as to the food textures children with DS find ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or ‚Äúdifficult,‚Äù further research is needed to better understand how to expand the variety of textures in the diets of children with DS. ¬© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Ross, C.

Aims‚ÄÉTo describe maternal bonding to offspring across the pregnancy and postnatal periods, and to examine a broad range of sociodemographic and psychosocial predictors of the maternal-offspring bond. Methods‚ÄÉData were drawn from a sample of 372 pregnant women participating in an Australian population-based longitudinal study of postnatal health and development. Participants completed maternal bonding questionnaires at each trimester and 8 weeks postnatal. Data were collected on a range of sociodemographic and psychosocial factors. Results‚ÄÉBonding increased significantly through pregnancy, in quality and intensity. Regression analyses indicated that stronger antenatal bonding at all time points (trimesters 1 through 3) predicted stronger postnatal bonding. Older maternal age, birth mother being born in a non-English speaking country, mother not working full time, being a first-time mother, breast-feeding problems, and baby's crying behavior all predicted poorer bonding at 8 weeks postpartum. Conclusion‚ÄÉThese novel findings have important implications for pregnant women and their infant offspring, and for health care professionals working in perinatal services. Importantly, interventions to strengthen maternal-fetal bonding would be beneficial during pregnancy to enhance postnatal bonding and infant health outcomes.","Rossen, L. and Hutchinson, D. and Wilson, J. and Burns, L. and Allsop, S. and Elliott, E.

Methods: Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we tracked the families of 3317 children starting 5¬†years before childbirth until the child reached 20¬†years of age. We used regression and latent growth curve modelling to estimate trajectories of poverty and economic hardship over time. Results: Families with a child with an ND had higher rates of poverty and economic hardship prior to childbirth and persistently over time. Analysis uncovered five latent trajectories for each indicator. After controlling for family and caregiver characteristics that preceded the birth of the child, raising a child with an ND was not associated with a unique trajectory of poverty. Families raising a child with an ND were however more likely to experience persistent economic hardship. Conclusions: The study establishes descriptive evidence for how having a child with an ND relates to changes in family economic conditions. The social and economic conditions that precede the child's birth seem to be driving the economic inequalities observed later throughout the life course. ¬© 2019 The Authors.

1698,Type 2 diabetes in children in the Netherlands: The need for diagnostic protocols,"Objective: The worldwide trend towards obesity in childhood is also observed in the Netherlands and one of the consequences may be type 2 diabetes. In this study, we assessed the number of children with type 2 diabetes, diagnosed by paediatricians, in the Netherlands. Methods: In 2003 and 2004 the Dutch Paediatric Surveillance Unit, a nationwide paediatric register, was used to assess new cases of diabetes mellitus. Data on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were collected by means of a questionnaire. A second questionnaire was sent to the reporting paediatrician if the diagnosis was inconclusive or if the diagnosis was type 1 diabetes in combination with overweight or obesity, according to international criteria. Results: During the 24 months of registration, the paediatricians reported 1142 new cases of diabetes, 943 of which were eligible for analysis. Initially, 14 patients (1.5%) were reported with type 2 diabetes. Only seven of these patients were classified as type 2 diabetes according to the ADA criteria, as information on C-peptides or antibodies was often missing. Based on clinical characteristics, the other seven patients were very likely to have type 2 diabetes. After the second questionnaire, six more patients met the ADA criteria and two were very likely to have type 2 diabetes. Most of the patients were female (95%), 14% were of Turkish and 18% of Moroccan origin. Conclusion: This study shows a discrepancy between the number of patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed by paediatricians in daily practice and diagnosed according to the ADA criteria. Moreover, a considerable amount of reported patients were misclassified. Finally, 2.4% patients were classified as (very likely) type 2 diabetes. The development of programmes and protocols for prevention, diagnosis and classification applicable in daily practice is warranted. ¬© 2007 Society of the European Journal of Endocrinology.","Rotteveel, J. and Belksma, E.

1699,"Perinatal depression influences on infant negative affectivity: Timing, severity, and co-morbid anxiety","Accumulating evidence suggests that antenatal depression predicts infants' negative affectivity, albeit with variable effect sizes. With a prospective longitudinal design, we sought to explain that variability by addressing questions about timing of the depression across pregnancy and the early postpartum, the role of high symptom levels relative to diagnosed depression, comorbidity with anxiety, and the potential mediating role of neuroendocrine functioning. Primiparous women ( n= 77) with histories of depression prior to pregnancy were assessed for cortisol levels monthly beginning by mid-pregnancy. Depression symptom levels and diagnostic status were similarly assessed monthly in pregnancy and also until infants reached three months of age, when mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised to measure infant negative affectivity. Antenatal depression symptoms and infant negative affectivity were positively associated ( r=.39). Controlling for depression symptom levels in other trimesters, only second trimester depression symptoms predicted higher infant negative affectivity ( Œ≤=.44). With postpartum depression symptom levels in the model, only antenatal depression symptoms predicted infant negative affectivity ( Œ≤=.45). In the context of depression, neither antenatal anxiety symptoms nor anxiety disorder diagnosis were associated with infant NA scores. The hypothesized role of elevated maternal cortisol as a mechanism for the association between antenatal depression and infant NA was not supported. Our findings contribute to efforts to more precisely identify infants of perinatally depressed mothers who are at greater risk for elevated negative affectivity, suggesting a window of vulnerability in mid pregnancy and the need for further study of potential mechanisms. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Rouse, M.

A total of ninety-seven non-breastfed term neonates were enrolled into a double-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial in which they received experimental (n 48) or standard formula (n 49) for 6 months. The primary outcome was weight at 6 months of age. Secondary outcomes were gastrointestinal tolerance and manifestation of atopic dermatitis. Faecal secretory IgA (SIgA) concentration and microbiota composition of forty-three infants were analysed at 1 and 6 months. Growth was similar in both groups. At 1month, compared to those in the control group, infants in the experimental group exhibited less crying or agitation, and more quiet behaviour (P=0‚Ä¢03). At 6 months, atopic dermatitis was less frequently observed in the experimental group (P<0‚Ä¢05). Decrease of faecal SIgA concentration between 1 and 6 months was mainly observed in the control group. This decrease was significantly associated with atopic dermatitis (P<0‚Ä¢014) and negatively correlated to the level of colonisation by bifidobacteria (P<0‚Ä¢005).

Results highlighted several consequences of child pickiness such as parental concerns about child‚Äôs growth and health, conflicts at mealtime, and feelings of guilt. Parents attributed food pickiness mainly as a manifestation of opposition and assertiveness by their child. Some strategies known to be effective were applied by parents (such as repeated exposure, modeling, co-preparing meals, and using a flavor-based approach) but some strategies that are counterproductive were also highlighted (such as rewards for eating). Parents need to be better informed about food pickiness and the strategies that help to overcome it.

Crying due to pain was analysed after a heel-prick stimulus. In a prospective, descriptive study, 50 healthy newborn infants were subjected to a heel-prick for phenylketonuria screening. Their cries of pain were recorded and analysed. Duration of the crying sound was analysed and, using a sound spectrogram, the fundamental frequency and the cry melody of the first five cry sounds were analysed. The analysis showed that the crying sound after the painful stimulus of the heel-prick had a significantly higher fundamental frequency and lasted longer at the first than at the fifth cry. The first cry had a more varied crying melody than the fifth. There were large differences between individual cries from a single infant, as well as in the duration of each cry, total crying time, and fundamental frequencies between infants. While the first cry was more like a cry of pain, the fifth cry more resembled crying for reasons other than pain. The results suggest that newborn infants react to pain in a recognizable way. However, other stimuli may cause a similar reaction. Crying can therefore be used to measure pain in newborn infants only when the cause of crying is known.","Runefors, P. and Arnbj√∂rnsson, E. and Elander, G. and Michelsson, K.",0,1367

Vital signs (i.e., pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation), crying time, and time for the vital signs to return to baseline values were recorded at different times during the examination. RESULTS: The vital signs did not vary significantly between the two groups. The participants in the control group had a trend of longer crying time, but this trend did not reach a level of statistical significance. In addition, The time required for the vital signs to return to their baseline values did not vary significantly. CONCLUSION: ROP screening is very distressful for preterm infants.

Participants in both groups completed three Web-based surveys, first when their infants were less than 3 months old (baseline, T1), then at 6 months (time 2, T2), and 9 months of age (time 3, T3). Surveys included questions on infant feeding practices and beliefs (Infant Feeding Questionnaire, IFQ), satiety responsiveness (Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire), and infant‚Äôs food exposure and liking. Multivariate linear regression models, estimated using maximum likelihood with bootstrapped standard errors, were fitted to compare continuous outcomes between the intervention groups, with adjustment for relevant covariates. Multivariate logistic regression adjusting for the same covariates was performed for categorical outcomes. Results: A total of 645 parents (Growing Healthy: n=301, Baby's First Food: n=344) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the study, reducing to a sample size of 546 (Growing Healthy: n=234, Baby's First Food: n=312) at T2 and a sample size of 518 (Growing Healthy: n=225, Baby's First Food: n=293) at T3.

DESIGN: A clinical trial of EMLA cream was conducted on 208 consecutive routine neonatal circumcisions. All circumcisions were performed by the Plastibell technique with prior use of EMLA anaesthetic cream. Results were obtained by intra-operative observation and follow-up questionnaire answered by parents. RESULTS: There was a marked decrease in crying during the procedure. In infants under the age of 7 months, 99.0% fed immediately, 96.0% settled rapidly and remained settled, 96.5% had no disturbance of sleep pattern, 92.5% had little or no pain and 96.0% had no pain or difficulty when urinating.

Ss responded to the questionnaire on the basis of their general ideas about child-rearing practices in their own culture and their own home experience. Significant differences across all cultures within each item were found. For example, Ethiopian, followed by Indian mothers were seen as most likely to suckle a crying infant. Israelis were thought to be most likely to feed a child on a schedule convenient to the mother and most likely to wean by sudden withdrawal rather than by gradual stages.

This experiment examines whether pacifiers interfere with caretakers' ability to mimic infants' emotions. Adults saw photographs of infants with or without a pacifier. When infants had pacifiers, perceivers showed reduced EMG activity to infants' smiles. Smiles of infants using a pacifier were also rated as less happy than smiles depicted without a pacifier. The same pattern was observed for expressions of distress: adults rated infants presented with pacifiers as less sad than infants without pacifiers. We discuss deleterious effects of pacifier use for the perceiver's resonance with a child's emotions. ¬© 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Rychlowska, M. and Korb, S. and Brauer, M. and Droit-Volet, S. and Augustinova, M. and Zinner, L. and Niedenthal, P.

1728,Sleep and sleep ecology in the first 3 years: A web-based study,"This study was designed to provide data on sleep patterns during the first 3 years, based on a large US-Canada Internet sample, to assess the prevalence of parental interventions and related factors of infant sleep ecology and to evaluate the links between sleep ecology and sleep. Five thousand six parents completed a web-based online questionnaire about their children, aged from birth to 36 months. The questionnaire included items pertaining to sleep patterns, sleep environment, sleep-related parental interventions, sleep position, and demographic information. The results reflected clear sleep-related developmental changes including a decrease in daytime sleep and total sleep time, as well as consolidation of sleep during the night, which was manifested in a decrease in night wakings and nocturnal wakefulness. Sleep ecology and parental behaviors significantly explained a portion of the variance in the child's sleep patterns. Parental interventions that encourage independence and self-soothing were associated with extended and more consolidated sleep, especially in comparison to more active interactions that were associated with shorter and more fragmented sleep. These findings provide parents and professionals reference data for assessing sleep in young children. Furthermore, the results provide information on specific ecological factors that are associated with increased risk for sleep problems. ¬© 2008 European Sleep Research Society.","Sadeh, A. and Mindell, J.

1731,Motion resistant pulse oximetry in neonates,"BACKGROUND: Pulse oximetry is widely used in neonates. However, its reliability is often affected by motion artefact. Clinicians confronted with questionable oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) values often estimate the reliability by correlating heart rate (HR) obtained with the oximeter with that obtained by electrocardiogram. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of motion on SpO(2) and HR measurements made with Masimo signal extraction technology and those made with a Nellcor N-200. DESIGN: Continuous pulse oximetry and HR monitoring were performed in 15 healthy, term infants (mean (SD) birth weight 3408 (458) g) undergoing circumcision, using Masimo and Nellcor pulse oximeters and a standard HR monitor (Hewlett-Packard). Simultaneous minute by minute behavioural activity codes were also assigned. Baseline data were collected for 10 minutes when the infant was quietly asleep and then continued during and after circumcision for a total duration of one hour. The oximeter HR and SpO(2) values were compared and related to HR values obtained by ECG during all three periods. The effect of behavioural activity on SpO(2) and HR was also evaluated. RESULTS: When compared with results obtained with the Nellcor, the mean SpO(2) and HR were higher and the incidence of artefact lower with the Masimo during all three periods. Masimo HR more accurately predicted HR obtained with a standard monitor, with lower residual error. SpO(2) and HR values obtained with the Nellcor were lower and more variable during all behavioural states, especially crying, when excessive motion artefact was most likely. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that Masimo signal extraction technology may offer improvement in pulse oximetry performance, particularly in clinical situations in which extreme motion artefacts are likely.","Sahni, R. and Gupta, A. and Ohira-Kist, K. and Rosen, T.

DESIGN: Prospective, double blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Postnatal ward of a tertiary-care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 210 babies who required venipuncture for blood sampling and who were on oral feeds were recruited into the study after parental informed consent. METHODS: The enrolled babies were randomized into intervention groups (EBM, 25% dextrose) and control group (sterile water). Two ml of test solution was given to baby by paladay (a traditional cup with a spout) 2 min before venipuncture. The face and crying of baby were video graphed by an independent, blinded observer. The facial response to pain (brow bulge, eye squeeze, nasolabial furrow) was analysed from the video. Maximum HR and minimum SpO2 were recorded during, and 1, 3 and 5 min after venipuncture by another blinded observer.

1734,Audio recording of infant crying: Comparison with maternal cry logs,"This study investigated the accuracy of mothers' reports of their babies' crying. The crying of babies, 5-16 weeks old, was recorded by means of a wire-less, miniature microphone contained within a terry cloth belt worn by the baby. Crying was transmitted to a voice-activated recorder with a range of 500 feet. Thirteen 24-hour recordings were obtained from seven infants while, at the same time, the mothers kept a Cry Log of their baby's crying. The number of minutes of crying and the number of bouts of crying obtained from the two procedures were highly correlated, although the amount of crying reported by the mothers was less than that obtained from the recorder. The mothers reported fewer bouts of crying. The results suggest that maternal cry reports are valuable for obtaining relative amounts of crying of infants within a group, as well as information on mothers' perceptions of their infants' crying, whereas audio recordings offer a more precise method for obtaining the amount and temporal patterning of infant crying.","Salisbury, A. and Minard, K. and Hunsley, M. and Thoman, E.

Two hundred twenty-three children (52.7%) received a two-needle vaccination while 200 (47.3%) received a one-needle vaccination. Three hundred forty-six parents (81.8%) returned a questionnaire reporting their child's reaction within 48 hours of injection. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of redness, swelling, tenderness, or limp or in parental measurements of redness and swelling between the one- and two-needle groups. Moreover, we found no differences in the frequency of systemic side effects, including fever, vomiting, anorexia, and crying.

1738,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease in infants: How much is predictable with questionnaires, pH-metry, eodoscopy and histology?","Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are common in infants. It is often difficult to discriminate between physiological and pathologic gastroesophageal reflux, although this discrimination is essential to determine which infants to evaluate and treat. Objectives: To identify the prevalence of reflux symptoms in infants and to evaluate the predictive value of a questionnaire and the correlation between pH study, histology and clinical score. Methods: Parents of 100 unselected infants visiting the well-baby clinic and 100 infants suspected of having gastroesophageal reflux disease were asked to fill in a 35-item questionnaire. A validated score, the Orenstein I-GERQ, was applied for selected questions. All infants suspected of having gastroesophageal reflux disease underwent prolonged esophageal pH monitoring and 44 or 100 underwent upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy with esophageal biopsy. Results: Parents of infants with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease reported significantly more regurgitation (68% versus 45%, P < 0.05) and crying (51% versus 20%, P < 0.01) compared with the parents of healthy infants. A pathologic pH study (reflux index >10%) was found in 21 of 100 (21%) infants and was significantly associated only with pneumonia, apnea with fussing (P = 0.013 for both), defecation less than once a day (P = 0.033) and constipation (P = 0.05). Esophagitis was present in 17 of 44 (39%) and no one question was found to be significantly predictive. 38% of infants with a pathologic pH study had a normal esophageal biopsy and 53% of infants with histologic esophagitis had a normal pH study. Discordance between pH study and biopsies occurred in 14 of 44 (32%) patients. The Orenstein I-GERQ cut-off score failed to identify eight of 31 (26%) infants with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Conversely, the score was positive in 17 of 22 (81%) infants with normal biopsy and pH study and in 1.4 of 47 (30%) infants with normal pH study. Conclusions: Clinical symptoms, histology and pH study show poor correlation in infants. Clinical symptoms such as regurgitation and crying are less frequent in unselected infants than in infants suspected of gastroesophageal reflux disease. However, questionnaires are poorly predictive for the severity of gastroesophageal reflux disease, as they do not correlate with esophageal acid exposure as measured by pH-metry and with esophagitis as evaluated by histology of esophageal biopsies. ¬© 2005 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Salvatore, S. and Hauser, B. and Vandemaele, K. and Novario, R. and Vandenplas, Y.",1,1389
1739,The relationship between parental behavior and infant regulation: A systematic review,"The formation of early regulatory behavior during the first years is an important developmental task and predictive for self-regulatory abilities in later life. Although parental behavior is thought to be highly influential in this developmental trajectory, associations between infant regulatory behavior and parental behavior have been diverse. The current paper systematically reviews the empirical research on the relationship between behavioral indicators of infant regulation‚Äìtemperamental characteristics, sleeping, crying, feeding‚Äìand parental behavior during the first two years of life. After screening 4254 articles obtained from Web of Science and PsycINFO, 107 studies were included in the systematic review. The studies fell short of integrating negative parental behavior, paternal variables and further demographic information into the research and did not reveal consistent findings. However, the studies indicated a positive relationship between parental behavior and infant regulation with differences according to age and measurement method. It appears that the use of semi-structured methods to measure infant regulation is most appropriate during the first year of life, whereas the use of structured measures is more advisable during the second year of life. In contrast, parental reports measuring infant regulation failed to show significant findings with parenting behavior at any given time. The association was more powerful when infant regulation was predicted by parental behavior than vice versa. However, the number of studies regarding the latter direction was limited. This review, thus, underlines the importance of using different measurement methods according to age, and discusses the ways to improve future research. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Samdan, G. and Kiel, N. and Petermann, F. and Rothenfu√üer, S. and Zierul, C. and Reinelt, T.",0,1390
1741,Factors associated with low incidence of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months,"Background: The identification of factors that are associated with early cessation of exclusive breastfeeding is important for defining strategies for the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding. The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of exclusive breastfeeding cessation before 6 months, including variables that generally receive little attention, such as the influence of grandmothers, breastfeeding technique, and sore nipples. Methods: This prospective study follows a cohort of 220 healthy mother-baby pairs from birth to 6 months, living in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Data were collected at the maternity unit, during a home visit at 30 days, and by telephone interview at 60, 120, and 180 days. Breastfeeding technique was assessed and breasts examined at the maternity unit and during home visits. Cox regression was employed to estimate the degree of association between the variables and the outcome. Results: The following factors were associated with cessation of exclusive breastfeeding before 6 months: adolescent mother (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48, 95% CI 1.01-2.17), fewer than six prenatal visits (HR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.10-2.33), use of a pacifier within the first month (HR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.12-2.11), and poor latch-on (HR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.06-1.58 for each unfavorable parameter). Conclusions: Activities to promote exclusive breastfeeding should be intensified for adolescent mothers and for those whose prenatal care was less than ideal. These activities should reinforce the ill effects of pacifiers and should also include appropriate instruction for these mothers in correct breastfeeding technique. ¬© 2007, Blackwell Publishing, Inc.","Santo, L.

Little evidence exists to support these beliefs, despite their implications on clinical management. This study attempted to investigate parental and medical personnel's beliefs about teething. The study was conducted by means of a questionnaire, submitted to 55 pediatricians and 130 nurses. A parent survey was conducted simultaneously. We evaluated 462 questionnaires. An association of teeth eruption with infant morbidity was believed to exist by 76% of the responders, mostly by parents and nurses, and less so by physicians. Irritability, fever, and loose stools/diarrhea were believed to be the most common symptoms associated to teeth eruption. We conclude that almost all parents, the majority of nurses, and many physicians believe that teething is associated with the appearance of symptoms, most of which are minor and relate to discomfort rather than physical illness, but a substantial minority still ascribes potentially serious symptoms to teething.","Sarrell, E.

1745,Little Buddhas: Children and Childhoods in Buddhist Texts and Traditions,"Buddhism has often been pronounced an anti-family religion. Narratives of child abandonment seem to overshadow whatever role family relationships might otherwise play. The Vessantara Jataka is a case in point: here, the future Buddha delivers his own children into the hands of an evil taskmaster in order to pursue his commitment to perfect generosity. In his final life story, the Buddha-to-be abandons his wife and newborn son for a life of homelessness in pursuit of an abstract ideal. With celibacy as a central value, the primary hero repeatedly abandoning his progeny from one lifetime to the next and his fellow monks following suit, not to mention the many stories in the Therigatha in which women seem to require the death of their children for spiritual advancement to become possible, the conclusion that Buddhism idealizes asceticism at the family's expense is not difficult to comprehend. But Buddhism is not limited to these narratives or to these interpretations. As the scholarship in this volume attests, Buddhist literature and lived realities exhibit many examples in which children and childhoods play a significant role. Children may be viewed as a hindrance to practice in some contexts, but there are many other narratives, rituals, and lived realities that tell a different story. ¬© Oxford University Press 2013.

1746,"A critical appraisal of strategies to optimize vitamin d status in germany, a population with a western diet","During the last decade, our scientific knowledge of the pleiotropic biological effects of vitamin D metabolites and their relevance to human health has expanded widely. Beyond the well-known key role of vitamin D in calcium homeostasis and bone health, it has been shown that vitamin D deficiency is associated with a broad variety of independent diseases, including several types of cancer, and with increased overall mortality. Moreover, recent findings have demonstrated biological effects of the vitamin D endocrine system that are not mediated via activation of the classical nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) by binding with high affinity to its corresponding ligand, the biologically active vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). In contrast, many of these new biological effects of vitamin D compounds, including regulation of the circadian clock and many metabolic functions, are mediated by other vitamin D metabolites, including 20-hydroxyvitamin D and 20,23-dihydroxyvitamin D, and involve their binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and retinoid-orphan receptor (ROR). In most populations, including the German population, UVB-induced cutaneous vitamin D production is the main source for fulfilling the human body‚Äôs requirements of vitamin D. However, this causes a dilemma because solar or artificial UVR exposure is associated with skin cancer risk. In addition to UVB-induced vitamin D production in skin, in humans, there are two other possible sources of vitamin D: from diet and supplements. However, only a few natural foods contain substantial amounts of vitamin D, and in most populations, the dietary source of vitamin D cannot fulfill the body¬¥s requirements. Because an increasing body of evidence has convincingly demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency is very common worldwide, it is the aim of this paper to (i) give an update of the vitamin D status in a population with a western diet, namely, the German population, and to (ii) develop strategies to optimize the vitamin D supply that consider both the advantages as well as the disadvantages/risks of different approaches, including increasing vitamin D status by dietary intake, by supplements, or by UVB-induced cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D. ¬© 2019 by the authors.

Primary outcome measures included the Neonatal Facial Scoring System (NFCS) score, duration of the first cry, total duration of cry and duration of procedure. Secondary outcome measured was the number of skin punctures needed to obtain blood. RESULTS: The NFCS score was not significantly different between the two groups and the duration of the procedure was significantly longer for the VP than the HP group (median 27 s vs. 7 s","Saththasivam, P. and Umadevan, D. and Ramli, N. and Voralu, K. and Naing, N.

Growth deficits were frequent in the preterm infants, especially during the first year of life with a tendency to ""catch up"" during the second year. Normal head growth and arm muscle area were documented in this selected group of infants but triceps skinfold thicknesses were deficient, especially during the first year. Food consumption patterns and energy intake differed with higher energy intake in the preterm group. Feeding problems were only slightly more frequent in the preterm infants. The only factor associated with energy intake in the preterm infants was duration of neonatal hospital stay. Weight percentile was associated with birthweight and socioeconomic status in term infants, and birthweight, hospital stay and ""fussy eater"" in preterms at specific ages.","Sauve, R.

1752,Cimetropium bromide in the treatment of crisis in infantile colic,"Background: Treatment of infantile colic remains an open issue. In Italy, cimetropium bromide is used extensively to treat infantile colic. The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was to investigate the effectiveness and side effects of cimetropium bromide in the treatment of infants with colic crisis. Methods: Ninety-seven infants with colic were enrolled. The diagnosis of infantile colic in healthy infants with regular growth, aged 15 to 60 days was made according to the criteria of Wessel. The infants were divided into two groups, one treated with cimetropium bromide (1.2 mg/kg) and the other treated with placebo at onset of each crisis for 3 days. Duration of crying and side effects were recorded daily in a structured diary for the 3 days of therapy. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square and t tests. Results: Eighty-six infants completed the trial. The average duration of crying for each crisis was 17.3 ¬± 12.6 minutes in the cimetropium bromide group and 47.5 ¬± 28.5 minutes in the placebo group (P < 0.005). Response to cimetropium bromide was 74%. Response to placebo was 33% (P < 0.05). Side effects did not differ significantly between the two groups, except sleepiness, which increased in the infants treated with cimetropium bromide. Conclusion: Cimetropium bromide was more effective than placebo in reducing the duration of crying in children with infantile colic. The use of the anticholinergic drugs, aside from the dicyclomine because of its dangerous side effects, should be revaluated for treating infantile colic. ¬© 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Savino, F. and Brondello, C. and Cresi, F. and Oggero, R. and Silvestro, L.",0,1401
1753,A prospective 10-year study on children who had severe infantile colic,"AIM: To evaluate the association between infantile colic and gastrointestinal, allergic and psychological disorders in childhood. METHODS: A prospective study was conducted on 103 infants aged 31-87 d. After 10 y, between 2001 and 2003, the children were recalled and a paediatrician evaluated the selected disorders by anamnesis, medical examination, laboratory tests and parent interviews. RESULTS: Of the 103 infants enrolled, 96 completed the study. There was an association between infantile colic and recurrent abdominal pain (p=0.001) and allergic disorders: allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, asthmatic bronchitis, pollenosis, atopic eczema and food allergy (p<0.05). Sleep disorders, fussiness, aggressiveness and feelings of supremacy are more frequent in children who suffered from colic during early infancy (p<0.05). A family history of gastrointestinal diseases and atopic diseases was significantly higher in infants with colic than in controls (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Susceptibility to recurrent abdominal pain, allergic and psychological disorders in childhood may be increased by infantile colic. Our findings confirm that severe infantile colic might be the early expression of some of the most common disorders in childhood.","Savino, F. and Castagno, E. and Bretto, R. and Brondello, C. and Palumeri, E. and Oggero, R.",0,1402
1754,"Preventive effects of oral probiotic on infantile colic: A prospective, randomised, blinded, controlled trial using Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938","Infants were recruited in four centres in North-West Italy. 138 infants were assessed for eligibility, 113 ones underwent randomisation and 105 completed the study. Newborns aged less than 10 days of life, with gestational age between 37 and 42 weeks, birth weight from 2,500 to 4,300 g and normal physical examination were recruitable. Premature infants and infants affected by outcomes of perinatal hypoxia or necrotising enterocolitis have been excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to receive five drops containing Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 (108 cfu) with 400 UI of vitamin D3 or only 400 UI of vitamin D3 daily. The primary endpoints concern the administration of pain relieving agents (cimetropium bromide at least three times per week or simethicone at least five times per week) from baseline to 12 weeks. Additional analyses were done on the percentage of infants that switched from an exclusive breastfeeding to a partial or exclusive formula feeding from baseline to 12 weeks. Data concerning the number of calls to the paediatricians and the number of visits at paediatricians' ambulatories due to infantile colic have been collected by paediatrician and analysed. Comparing the two groups, the relative risk was 0.04 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.01-0.31) for cimetropium bromide, 0.24 (95% CI=0.14-0.41) for simethicone and 0.37 (95% CI=0.17-0.80) for the administration of infant formula, showing a protective action of L. reuteri. The treatment group showed a lower number of paediatric consultations related to episodes of infant colic than the control group (P < 0.0001). L. reuteri DSM 17938 supplementation at the tested dosage could reduce parental discomfort due to infantile colic. The consumption of this probiotic is associated with a reduction of paediatric consultations for infantile colic, as well as use of pain relieving agents and of infant formula. ¬© 2014 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","Savino, F. and Ceratto, S. and Poggi, E. and Cartosio, M.

1755,Molecular identification of coliform bacteria from colicky breastfed infants,"Objective: To determine the presence of intestinal coliform bacteria in colicky vs healthy infants. Study design: We isolated coliform strains from faeces and performed quantitative bacterial cultures in 41 colicky and 39 healthy breastfed infants, identified using PCR with species-specific primers, strain-specific Automated Ribotyping and the API-50E kit for Enterobacteriaceae to identify the most frequent strains. Results: Coliform strains were more abundant in colicky infants (median 6.04 log10 CFU/g faeces, range 2.00-8.76) vs controls (median 4.47 log10 CFU/g faeces, range 1.00-8.08) (p = 0.026). Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, E. aerogenes and Enterococcus faecalis were the predominant species in colicky and healthy infants. The counts of each bacterial species differed between the two groups, and the difference was significant (p = 0.002) for E. coli: median 6.30 log10 CFU/g faeces (range 3.00-8.74) in colicky infants, and median 4.70 log10 CFU/g faeces (range 2.00-5.85) in controls. Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate the colonization patterns of gas-forming coliforms in colicky infants and healthy controls identified by molecular methods. Coliform bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli, were found to be more abundant in colicky infants. Our data could help to shed light on the cause of infantile colic. ¬© 2009 Foundation Acta P?diatrica/Acta P?diatrica.","Savino, F. and Cordisco, L. and Tarasco, V. and Calabrese, R. and Palumeri, E. and Matteuzzi, D.",0,1404

1759,Crying Time and RORŒ≥/FOXP3 Expression in Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938-Treated Infants with Colic: A Randomized Trial,"Objectives To evaluate crying time, retinoid-related orphan receptor-Œ≥ (RORŒ≥) and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) messenger RNA levels (transcription factors that can modulate T cell responses to gut microbes), and to investigate gut microbiota and fecal calprotectin in infants treated with Lactobacillus reuteri for infantile colic. Study design A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted in primary care in Torino from August 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016. Patients suffering from infantile colic were randomly assigned to receive daily oral L reuteri (1 √ó 108 colony forming unit) or placebo for 1 month. Daily crying times were recorded in a structured diary. FOXP3 and RORŒ≥ messenger RNA in the peripheral blood was assessed with real-time TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Gut microbiota and fecal calprotectin were evaluated. Results After infants with colic were supplemented with L reuteri DSM 17938 for 30 days, crying times were significantly shorter among infants with colic in the probiotic group compared with infants in the placebo group (74.67 ¬± 25.04 [IQR = 79] minutes /day vs 147.85 [IQR = 135] minutes /day [P =.001]). The FOXP3 concentration increased significantly (P =.009), resulting in decreased RORŒ≥/FOXP3 ratios: 0.61 (IQR = 0.60) at day 0 and 0.48 (IQR = 0.28) at day 30 (P =.028). Furthermore, the probiotic increased the percentage of Lactobacillus (P =.049) and decreased fecal calprotectin (P =.0001). Conclusions Infants with colic treated with L reuteri for 30 days had a significantly decreased crying time and an increased FOXP3 concentration, resulting in a decreased RORŒ≥/FOXP3 ratio.

Design: Prospective randomized controlled study. Setting: Italy. Subjects: Two hundred and sixty-seven formula-fed infants, aged less than 4 months, with infantile colic, were randomized to receive either the new infant formula (study treatment (ST)) or a standard formula and simethicone (6 mg/kg twice a day) (control treatment (CT)). A questionnaire was given to parents to evaluate for 14 days the daily number of colic episodes and crying time. Results: Out of the 199 infants who completed the study, 96 were treated with the new formula and 103 were not treated. Infants receiving the new formula had a significant decrease in colic episodes after 1 week (2.47¬±1.94 at day 7 vs 5.99¬±1.84 at the study entry) compared to infants receiving the CT (3.72¬±1.98 at day 7 vs 5.41¬±1.88 at the study entry) (P<0.0001).

1762,Lactobacillus reuteri (American Type Culture Collection Strain 55730) versus simethicone in the treatment of infantile colic: A prospective randomized study,"OBJECTIVE. The goal was to test the hypothesis that oral administration of Lactobacillus reuteri in a prospective randomized study would improve symptoms of infantile colic. METHODS. Ninety breastfed colicky infants were assigned randomly to receive either the probiotic L reuteri (108 live bacteria per day) or simethicone (60 mg/day) each day for 28 days. The mothers avoided cow's milk in their diet. Parents monitored daily crying times and adverse effects by using a questionnaire. RESULTS. Eighty-three infants completed the trial: 41 in the probiotic group and 42 in the simethicone group. The infants were similar regarding gestational age, birth weight, gender, and crying time at baseline. Daily median crying times in the probiotic and simethicone groups were 159 minutes/day and 177 minutes/day, respectively, on the seventh day and 51 minutes/day and 145 minutes/day on the 28th day. On day 28, 39 patients (95%) were responders in the probiotic group and 3 patients (7%) were responders in the simethicone group. No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS. In our cohort, L reuteri improved colicky symptoms in breastfed infants within 1 week of treatment, compared with simethicone, which suggests that probiotics may have a role in the treatment of infantile colic.

1764,Maternal prenatal felt security and infant health at birth interact to predict infant fussing and crying at 12 months postpartum,"Infants born with medical problems are at risk for less optimal developmental outcomes. This may be, in part, because neonatal medical problems are associated with maternal distress, which may adversely impact infants. However, the reserve capacity model suggests that an individual's bank of psychosocial resources buffers the adverse effects of later-encountered stressors. This prospective longitudinal study examined whether preexisting maternal psychosocial resources, conceptualized as felt security in close relationships, moderate the association between neonatal medical problems and infant fussing and crying 12 months postpartum. Maternal felt security was measured by assessing its indicators in 5,092 pregnant women. At birth, infants were classified as healthy or having a medical problem. At 12 months, experience sampling was used to assess daily maternal reports of fussing and crying in 135 mothers of infants who were healthy or had medical problems at birth. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that attachment, relationship quality, self-esteem, and social support can be conceptualized as indicators of a single felt security factor. Multiple regression analyses revealed that prenatal maternal felt security interacts with infant health at birth to predict fussing and crying at 12 months. Among infants born with medical problems, higher felt security predicted decreased fussing and crying. Maternal felt security assessed before birth dampens the association between neonatal medical problems and subsequent infant behavior. This supports the hypothesis that psychosocial resources in reserve can be called upon in the face of a stressor to reduce its adverse effects on the self or others. ¬© 2015 American Psychological Association.","Sawada, N. and Gagn√©, F.

1765,Abnormal physiological responses to touch among children with persistent feeding difficulties,"Pediatric feeding/swallowing specialists commonly observe infants and toddlers who present with gagging or significant behavior state changes as a result of touch to oral and body regions. To date, this behavior has not been fully characterized or documented experimentally. This paper describes an exploratory study aimed at filling in these lacunae and providing a possible explanation. The study compares the responses to firm tactile pressure of 40 children between the ages of 3 and 18 months. The experimental group consisted of 20 children (12 males, 8 females) with heterogeneous medical diagnoses, at least 2 weeks of alternative feedings during the first 3 months of life, and a common history of persistent feeding difficulties. The comparison group consisted of 20 children with an unremarkable medical history matched by age and sex to the experimental group. Firm, tactile pressure was applied in a predetermined sequence following dermatome regions from legs to mouth. Response was recorded in terms of presence/absence of gagging and/or behavior state changes. Fifteen of the 20 children in the experimental group showed gagging (14) or inconsolable crying (1) in response to touch. None of the matched comparison group demonstrated either gagging or behavior state changes. The experimental and comparison groups showed significant differences in response to tactile input. Further, the source of these abnormal responses must be sought in similarity of experience across heterogeneous medical diagnoses and interventions. One possible explanation is a history of oral deprivation due to alternative feedings.","Scarborough, D. R. and Boyce, S. and McCain, G. and Oppenheimer, S. and August, A. and Strinjas, J. N.",0,1414
1766,"In practice, the theory is different: A processual analysis of breastfeeding in northeast Brazil","'Na pr√°tica, a teoria √® outra' (in practice, the theory is different) is an old Brazilian saying. This phrase summarizes well the general practice of breastfeeding in Brazil: 'Breast is best' is central in the pregnant women's future oriented 'theory' of how their infant should be fed. In the subsequent weeks after delivery, however, in the daily practicalities of feeding their infant, this theory is, to a large extent, abandoned. The present study is based on a sample of 300 mothers in the city of Aracaju in the Northeast of Brazil. Through interviews, the differences and similarities between knowledge and practice with respect to infant feeding were established. An explanation of these differences is developed on the basis of a processual analysis of the qualitative and quantitative results of the interview data. Nearly all mothers were knowledgeable of the need to breastfeed, and nearly all mothers had initiated breastfeeding. However, only a minority was exclusively breastfeeding at the time of the interview. A distinction is made between a breastfeeding process and a de-breastfeeding process. The data suggest that mothers, in general, start the de-breastfeeding process with the positive intention of ameliorating the infant's situation without realizing the negative processual consequences that most likely ends in a cessation of breastfeeding. The study supports the view that health policy should underline the processual character of both breastfeeding and de-breastfeeding when promoting the importance of exclusive breastfeeding. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Ninety-three mothers described their child's temperament at 3 and 9 months. The results revealed that increased negative emotionality at 9 months was related not only to high levels of fussiness at 3 months but also to mothers' concerns and worries about their personal relationships. It was found that infants of mothers who tended to be avoidant in their close adult relationships showed increased levels of negative emotionality during the latter part of the first year. Further, infants of mothers who appeared secure (not avoidant) in their adult close relationships showed decreased levels of negative emotionality. The findings of the present study give some support to a directional link between caregivers' characteristics and the regulation of negative emotionality in infancy.","Scher, A. and Mayseless, O.",0,1417

1772,"The Effects of Calibration Target, Screen Location, and Movement Type on Infant Eye-Tracking Data Quality","During infant eye-tracking, fussiness caused by the repetition of calibration stimuli and body movements during testing are frequent constraints on measurement quality. Here, we systematically investigated these constraints with infants and adults using EyeLink 1000 Plus. We compared looking time and dispersion of gaze points elicited by stimuli resembling commonly used calibration animations. The adult group additionally performed body movements during gaze recording that were equivalent to movements infants spontaneously produce during testing. In our results, infants‚Äô preference for a particular calibration target did not predict data quality elicited by that stimulus, but targets exhibiting the strongest contrasts in their center or targets with globally distributed complexity resulted in the highest accuracy. Our gaze measures from the adult movement tasks were differentially affected by the type of movement as well as the location where the target appeared on the screen. These heterogeneous effects of movement on measures should be taken into account when planning infant eye-tracking experiments. Additionally, to improve data quality, infants‚Äô tolerance for repeated calibrations can be facilitated by alternating between precise calibration targets. ¬© International Congress of Infant Studies (ICIS)","Schlegelmilch, K. and Wertz, A.

1773,Factors in the Hospital Experience Associated with Postpartum Breastfeeding Success,"Introduction: Hospitals are in a unique position to promote, protect, and support breastfeeding. However, the association between in-hospital events and breastfeeding success within population-based samples has not been well studied. Materials and Methods: A stratified (by education and birth weight) systematic sample of 5,770 mothers taking part in the Utah Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, 2012-2015, were included. Mothers, 2-4 months postpartum, completed the 82-item questionnaire, including if they had ever breastfed their new baby, and if so, current breastfeeding status. Relationships between in-hospital experiences and breastfeeding termination and duration were evaluated via Poisson and Cox proportional hazard regression models, respectively, adjusting for other in-hospital experiences, maternal age, race/ethnicity, maternal education, marital status, smoking, physical activity, delivery method, pregnancy complications, and length of hospital stay. Results: Of all, 94.4% of mothers self-reported breastfeeding initiation, of whom 18.8% had breastfed <2 months, having breastfed on average 3.2 weeks (standard error: 0.07). In fully adjusted models, mothers who reported receiving a pacifier, receiving formula, or had staff help them learn how to breastfeed had a higher prevalence of terminating breastfeeding before 2 months (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.97-1.32","Schliep, K.

Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted and controlled for psychosocial and neurological factors. Results: More than half of the sample had RP at least at one measurement point. In about 8% of infants, RP persisted across the preschool years. Multiple RP and feeding problems increased the odds of eating problems at 20 and 56 months. Persistent RP and feeding problems were predictive of deficits in preschool adaptive behaviour and social skills. In addition, sex differences were found. Conclusions: Multiple RP and feeding problems had the highest stability. Persistent RP were predictive of adverse social and adaptive behaviour.

1775,"Predictors of crying, feeding and sleeping problems: A prospective study","Background Infant regulatory problems, that is, excessive crying, feeding and/or sleeping difficulties, are precursors of adverse development. However, the aetiology of regulatory problems is still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate pre-, peri- and post-natal neurophysiological and psychosocial predictors of single and multiple regulatory problems at 5 months of age. Methods This prospective longitudinal study included all children born at neonatal risk in a geographically defined area in southern Germany. The data of n= 5093 singleton infants (83.6%) were analysed using crude and multivariate logistic regression analyses. As outcome measures we used single and multiple regulatory problems, that is, crying, feeding and/or sleeping difficulties at 5 months of age, which were assessed via a standardized interview with the parents by study paediatricians as part of a neurodevelopmental examination. Results In total, 30.7% of the sample suffered from single or multiple regulatory problems at 5 months. Breastfeeding increased the odds of single sleeping problems 5.12-fold, but decreased the odds of single feeding problems [odds ratio (OR) 0.51","Schmid, G. and Schreier, A. and Meyer, R. and Wolke, D.",1,1422
1777,The Munich screening programme in neonates,"For development, it is necessary to stimulate the auditory pathway during the first weeks of life. This knowledge and improved techniques for the treatment of young children with hearing loss make early detection even more important, otherwise developmental disabilities inevitably occur. The method of transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions is the most useful test for neonatal screening and has the following advantages: emissions are quickly measured (i.e. within a few minutes), the measurements can be performed in the hospital nursery by trained volunteer examiners, the test produces the same results in awake, anaesthetized, sedated, and sleeping patients, and the existence of TEOAEs excludes with very high probability a peripheral hearing loss which may influence the development of speech.

Identifying family characteristics associated with a more ‚Äòobesogenic‚Äô home can provide insight into the determinants, and has implications for targeting and tailoring strategies to promote healthier lifestyles. The present study examined maternal characteristics associated with a more obesogenic home environment in 1113 families with preschool children. Primary caregivers (99% mothers) from the Gemini cohort completed the Home Environment Interview (HEI) when their children were 4 years old. Maternal demographics and BMI were assessed in the Gemini baseline questionnaire when the children were on average 8 months old. Maternal eating style was assessed when the children were on average 2 years old, using the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ).

1780,Effects of d-3-hydroxybutyrate treatment on hypoglycemic coma in rat pups,"d-3-Hydroxybutyrate (3OHB) is an alternative energy substrate for the brain during hypoglycemia, especially in infancy. Knowledge of the capacity and limits of 3OHB to compensate for cerebral glucose depletion during hypoglycemia in developing brain is important for its potential clinical use, but is scarce. We studied the effect of 3OHB treatment during insulin-induced hypoglycemia in 13-day-old rat pups. 3OHB treatment resulted in increased 3OHB plasma levels in hypoglycemic animals (3-4. mM vs. 0.5-1. mM untreated), and delayed the onset of clinical coma by 70. min and of burst-suppression coma by 90. min. 3OHB treated animals did not survive after resuscitation with glucose, compared to 80% survival of untreated hypoglycemic pups. Cleaved-caspase-3 immunohistochemistry and double labeling studies demonstrated a 20-fold increase of apoptotic mature oligodendrocytes in white matter of 3OHB treated animals. 3OHB treatment delays the onset of clinical and burst-suppression coma during hypoglycemia, but the prolonged duration of hypoglycemia is associated with increased mortality after resuscitation and cellular white matter injury. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Schutz, P.

1782,Causes and correlates of frequent night awakenings in early childhood,"Night awakenings are a normative part of early development. In the first year, night awakenings are associated with birth order, feeding route, sleep aid use, sleep location, infant temperament and development, infant-parent attachment, family socioeconomics, and cultural norms. In the second year, additional factors build on these foundational features, including parenting practices and object attachment. As children grow, contextual factors like preschool entry or changes in family member status may influence the continuation or exacerbation of awakenings. Future research should consider the multitude of factors that influence not only awakenings but also parental perceptions, family dynamics, and cultural norms. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Schwichtenberg, A.

1783,The expression of perinatal depression in rural Ghana,"In low- and middle-income countries, perinatal depression (PND) has been associated with poor infant health outcomes, including frequency of infant diarrheal episodes, preterm delivery and low birth weight, and discontinuation or problems breastfeeding. Yet little is known about the awareness or expression of PND depression in Ghana. A total of 12 in-depth key-informant interviews were conducted with women who had experienced PND within the previous two-and-a-half years. Three focus-group discussions were conducted with new mothers (n = 11), grandmothers (n = 8), and fathers (n = 9) for contextual and supporting information. ‚ÄòThinking too much‚Äô was the term most commonly used to describe PND. The women saw their distress as caused largely by poverty, lack of social support, and domestic problems. Women sought help through family and religious organizations, rather than through medical services. Problems producing breast milk or breastfeeding were nearly universal complaints and suggest significant effects on infant health in the study area. These results present evidence to support the increasing consensus that depression presents in similar and disabling ways across cultures and contexts. This formative qualitative data is required to tailor depression prevention or treatment interventions to this particular socio-cultural context. ¬© 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Scorza, P. and Owusu-Agyei, S. and Asampong, E. and Wainberg, M.

1784,Night waking in 1-year-old children in England,"A national sample of 1500 mothers of 1-year-old children received a postal questionnaire concerned with the sleeping patterns of their children. The response rate was 69%. Seventeen per cent of mothers reported that their 1-year-old presented a moderate or severe sleep problem and 26% said their child woke at night on at least five nights a week. While these two measures correlated, 10% of those who reported their infant woke on at least five nights a week did not consider this to be a problem. Neither sex of infant, social class, method of infant feeding or numbers of house moves were associated with sleep problems. The pattern of results strongly suggest an association between night waking and other sleeping difficulties and stress for mothers. This was indicated by the association we found with complaints about housing, overcrowding, more negative attitudes toward motherhood, lower assessments of maternal well-being, lack of practical support from partners, the use of more negative adjectives to describe their baby and more frequent feelings of being dominated by their baby. While these associations may be explained by the stresses of living with a night-waking baby, it is also likely that a mother who is feeling somewhat depressed and negative toward her baby is more likely to see night waking as significant and as a problem. There were class differences in how parents coped with a shortage of space. Middle-class parents were more likely to put a baby in with a sibling while working class parents more often had the baby in their own room. Middle-class parents were more likely to leave a night-waking baby to cry.","Scott, G. and Richards, M. P.",0,1430

In total, 54 fathers and 71 mothers completed self-report measures of postnatal depressive symptoms, parenting stress, efficacy, responsiveness, attachment, and family and social support. Paired sample t test revealed a significant relationship within couples in their level of parenting stress. Fathers reported lower levels of postnatal depression, responsiveness, and attachment than did mothers. Fathers rated their level of social support to be higher than did mothers.

The duration and intensity of Ss' smiles were observed. Preterm infants spent less time than full-term infants displaying big smiles in Episode 1 and had a less pronounced decrease in big smiles in Episode 2. Although both groups of Ss showed the still-face effect, it was more dramatic in full-term than in preterm infants. Maternal depressive symptoms did not differ significantly between groups. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with small-to-medium smiles in the baseline episode. Findings confirm the robustness of the still-face paradigm and its potential usefulness for research on individual as well as group differences in affective communication in infants.

Twenty-six neonates undergoing KC and 30 control neonates at a university hospital participated in this study. Physiological responses of neonates, including heart rate, oxygen saturation, duration of crying and Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP) scores were measured and compared before, during and 1‚Äâmin and 2‚Äâmin after heel sticks. The heart rate of KC neonates was lower at both 1 and 2‚Äâmin after sampling than those of the control group. Also, PIPP scores of KC neonates were significantly lower both during and after sampling.

We also analyzed the trend of nocturnal awakenings and total sleep duration from 3 to 12 months of age. Methods The parents of 704 infants (49.3% female) were interviewed during their first year of life. The interview included questions on infant sleep (eg, sleep habits, sleep duration, number of nocturnal awakenings) and maternal perception of infant sleep difficulties. Results The study results indicate that most of the infants at risk, with three or more nocturnal awakenings or ‚â§10 h of total sleep duration in the early months of life, tend to display a similar pattern of sleep problems at 12 months. The main early predictors of sleep problems at 12 months were sleep duration, sleep initiation method, and nocturnal awakenings. More specifically, infants with three or more nocturnal awakenings or ‚â§10 h of total sleep duration at 12 months were those with a higher number of awakenings during the night and a shorter sleep duration, at both three and six months. In addition, infants at risk for sleep problems at 12 months had an independent sleep initiation method at three months, whereas these same infants had a nonindependent sleep initiation method at six months. Conclusions Our study identified the early predictors of sleep problems at 12 months.

Prospective parents would like more information during pregnancy to prepare them for parenting, and need access to trusted and quality information. The Royal Women's Hospital (the Women's) in Melbourne, Australia, a large tertiary referral maternity hospital, developed a parenting education kit known as 'Growing Together'. The kit, designed to guide prospective and new parents from conception until 1 year after birth, includes three components: an A4 sized book, a specifically designed 'App' and a children's story book. We aim to evaluate the impact of the kit on a range of outcomes. Methods: A two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial will be used. Antenatal clinic days will be randomised to either the intervention or standard care arms. Women in the intervention arm receive the kit at their antenatal booking visit. Women in the standard care arm receive the standard information resources at the Women's. Analyses will be by intention to treat. Inclusion criteria: primiparous women with adequate English-speaking ability and ‚â§ 30 weeks' gestation at first pregnancy booking appointment.

A cross-sectional survey using semi-structured questionnaires and problem-based scenarios was carried out. Responses were compared to those recommended in the World Health Organization (WHO) Breastfeeding Counselling Course. The setting was a rural area of KwaZulu Natal, with a population of 220 000 people. At the time of the study approximately 36 per cent of pregnant women were HIV-infected and no programme to prevent mother-to-child transmission was in place. A convenient sample of 71 healthcare workers (14 doctors, 25 professional nurses, 16 staff nurses, and 16 community health workers) were included in the study. Over 50% of respondents had given breastfeeding advice to clients over the previous month. However, there were significant discrepancies in breastfeeding knowledge compared to WHO recommendations. Ninety-three per cent (n = 13) of doctors knew that breastfeeding should be initiated within 30 min of delivery, but 71 per cent (n = 10) would recommend water, and 50 per cent (n = 7) solids to breastfed infants under 6 months of age. Fifty-seven per cent (n = 8) considered glucose water necessary for neonatal jaundice, constipation, and for infants immediately after delivery. Only 44 per cent (n = 7) of staff nurses and 56 per cent (n = 14) of professional nurses knew that breastfeeding should be on demand. The majority would recommend water, formula milk, and solids to breastfed infants under 6 months of age, and glucose water for neonatal jaundice and immediately after delivery. Knowledge of community health workers differed most from WHO recommendations: only 37 per cent (n = 6) knew that breastfeeding should be initiated within 30 min of delivery, 68 per cent (n = 11) thought breastfeeding should be on schedule and not on demand, and the majority would recommend supplements to infants under 6 months of age. Few respondents suggested taking a feeding history or observing a breastfeed in response to the problem scenarios. The most commonly given responses to problems of babies who were perceived to be thirsty, unsatisfied, or crying after feeds was to supplement with other fluids or feeds. There is a need for systematic and ongoing training in breastfeeding and infant feeding counselling in the context of HIV, so that breastfeeding is not undermined by the current HIV pandemic, and exclusive breastfeeding continues to be promoted for all HIV-uninfected women, women of unknown status, and HIV-infected women who choose to breastfeed.","Shah, S. and Rollins, N.

Materials and Methods This was a double blinded randomized clinical trial performed during May 2015-June 2017 in pediatric ward of Amir-Al-Momenin Hospital, Zabol city, Iran. Overall, 72 infants were randomly assigned to either glucose or simethicone groups (36 infants per group). Treatments were continued for 28 days with either 25% or 30% glucose solution and 2.5 mg/kg simethicone. Outcomes were assessed at the end of the intervention (28 days). Statistical analysis was done in SPSS version 22.0. Results Males and females constituted 20 (55.5%), and 16 (45.5%) in glucose administrated, and 23 (63.8%) and 13 (36.2%, P=0.4) in simethicone group respectively. The mean age (days) was 19.1¬±3.8 and 20.2¬±4.9 for glucose and simethicone administrated groups, respectively (P=0.2). The crying times per day significantly reduced in both groups (mean reduction in crying times of 3.7¬±2.1, and 6.3¬±2.1 hours in glucose and simethicone groups, respectively). Moreover, 25% and 44.4% of infants in glucose and simethicone groups achieved ‚â• 50% reduction in crying time, respectively (P=0.06). According to the glucose dose, infants who received 30% glucose solution significantly revealed higher ratio of ‚â• 50% reduction in crying time (47.3%) than those received 25% glucose solution in which no cases fulfilled this outcome (P<0.0001).

METHODS: In children 6 to 36 months of age undergoing tympanocentesis for acute otitis media, the authors measured pain and distress throughout all phases of the procedure and recovery using physiological (heart rate) and behavioral measures (cry duration, Global Mood Scale score, and pain visual analog scales). They compared--in a randomized controlled trial--3 pain reduction interventions: acetaminophen, acetaminophen plus codeine, and ibuprofen plus midazolam. RESULTS: Heart rate increased throughout the procedure, peaking during needle aspiration. Children treated with acetaminophen alone had higher peak heart rates and Global Mood Scale scores during parts of the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Acetaminophen alone may not be as effective in reducing pain-related physiological and behavioral changes as acetaminophen plus codeine or ibuprofen plus midazolam during diagnostic tympanocentesis.","Shaikh, N. and Hoberman, A. and Kurs-Lasky, M. and Rockette, H.

1807,Infantile Vocalizations in Rats,"Rat pups are reared in a nest with a pile of littermates. When a preweaning pup is placed in isolation for a brief period of time, it displays an increase in activity that includes vocalization with frequencies in the ultrasonic range (~ 40 kHz). The vocalization response to isolation is used to investigate early life communicatory, social, and affective behaviors. The rate of vocalization is influenced by multiple sensory stimuli including thermal, tactile, and olfactory. Measured at room temperature, the rate of isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations conforms to an inverted-U shaped pattern, peaking between postnatal days 7‚Äì11 when the thermoregulatory and locomotor capabilities of the pup remain poor. Other acoustic variables such as duration, amplitude, frequency range, frequency at maximum amplitude, and waveform are also reported in the literature and described in this chapter. Vocal parameters are often correlated but there is no fixed relationship among them. ¬© 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Shair, H. N.",0,1447
1808,"Social, thermal, and temporal influences on isolation-induced and maternally potentiated ultrasonic vocalizations of rat pups","Sensory and temporal factors have been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) of young rats. Sensory cues include thermal, olfactory, and tactile modalities. Temporal factors include the time spent in isolation. The goal of the present research was to examine the interaction of these factors in both isolation-induced and maternally potentiated USV. Maternal potentiation of USV occurs when a brief interaction with the dam, even a passive (anesthetized) dam, elicits an augmented vocal response to a subsequent isolation, with rates of USV in rat pups well above those emitted in standard isolation tests. We found that passive maternal potentiation of USV did occur under all conditions tested. Neither a 30-min prior isolation nor high ambient temperature prevented an increase in USV rate over the rate of the original isolation. After 30-min isolation at warm temperatures when the rate of USV had fallen to zero, the pups increased vocalization in the presence of the dam as well as in the subsequent isolation. Temporal and thermal factors also interacted significantly in regulating the level of the USV emitted by the pups during the first isolation, in the presence of the anesthetized dam, and during the second isolation. ¬© 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Shair, H.

The effect of these early problems on later parenting is not known. This study explored whether mothers‚Ä≤ recollections surrounding the birth and hospitalization of a preterm infant affected their perceptions and their parenting of these children at 3 years of age. Twenty-seven primary caregivers of 30 prematurely born children completed three questionnaires on their perceptions of their children and were interviewed about parenting experiences. The core concept identified in analysis was compensatory parenting, a parenting style in which mothers provided special experiences and avoided others in an attempt to compensate the children for their neonatal experiences. Compensatory parenting was influenced by the view of these prematurely born children as both special and normal and by salient prenatal, labor, and delivery experiences","Shandor Miles, M. and Holditch-Davis, D.",0,1450
1811,"Association of Food Insecurity with Children's Behavioral, Emotional, and Academic Outcomes: A Systematic Review","Objective: Food Insecurity (FI) occurs in 21% of families with children and adolescents in the United States, but the potential developmental and behavioral implications of this prevalent social determinant of health have not been comprehensively elucidated. This systematic review aims to examine the association between FI and childhood developmental and behavioral outcomes in western industrialized countries. Method: This review provides a critical summary of 23 peer reviewed articles from developed countries on the associations between FI and adverse childhood developmental behavioral outcomes including early cognitive development, academic performance, inattention, externalizing behaviors, and depression in 4 groups-infants and toddlers, preschoolers, school age, and adolescents. Various approaches to measuring food insecurity are delineated. Potential confounding and mediating variables of this association are compared across studies. Alternate explanatory mechanisms of observed effects and need for further research are discussed. Results: This review demonstrates that household FI, even at marginal levels, is associated with children's behavioral, academic, and emotional problems from infancy to adolescence across western industrialized countries - even after controlling for confounders. Conclusions: While the American Academy of Pediatrics already recommends routine screening for food insecurity during health maintenance visits, the evidence summarized here should encourage developmental behavioral health providers to screen for food insecurity in their practices and intervene when possible. Conversely, children whose families are identified as food insecure in primary care settings warrant enhanced developmental behavioral assessment and possible intervention. ¬© Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

1814,A Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Effect of Two Topical Anesthetics on Pain Response During Frenotomy in Young Infants,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the comparative effectiveness of two topical anesthetics in controlling the pain associated with tongue-tie release (frenotomy) in young infants. DESIGN: Randomized trial. SETTING: A Pediatric Craniofacial Clinic. SUBJECTS: Forty-two infants who were referred for frenotomy were randomly allocated to receive the topical anesthetic gel 2% tetracaine or 20% benzocaine applied prior to frenotomy. Frenotomies were videotaped. The primary outcome measure was the Neonatal Facial Coding System (NFCS) score. Secondary outcome measures included cry duration and a visual analog scale (VAS) assessed by the parents. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable with regard to weight, age, gender, previous painful experience, and last feeding time. Median NFCS scores prior to frenotomy in the tetracaine and the benzocaine groups were 4.5 (IQR: 0.75‚Äì10.2) and 3.5 (IQR: 0‚Äì9.5), respectively (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.89, 95% CI ‚àí3 to 4). During frenotomy, median NFCS score increased to 28 (IQR: 24.5‚Äì30.25) in the tetracaine group (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001, median difference ‚àí22, 95% CI ‚àí24.5 to ‚àí19), and to 28 (IQR: 26‚Äì30) in the benzocaine group (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001, median difference ‚àí23, 95% CI ‚àí27 to ‚àí17). Mean cry durations in the tetracaine and the benzocaine groups were 69.4‚Äâseconds and 63.9‚Äâseconds, respectively (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.32, 95% CI ‚àí47 to 15), and mean VAS scores were 57.2 and 58.2, respectively (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.89, 95% CI ‚àí15.2 to 13.4).

1815,The imperative to breastfeed: An australian perspective,"Australia is considered to have a high breastfeeding initiation rate. Research has demonstrated that the main reason that many women choose to breastfeed their baby is based on their understanding that 'breast is best'. This is not surprising given that the benefits of breastfeeding are broadly promoted and a number of strategies have been deliberately employed globally, nationally and locally to actively support and promote breastfeeding. In this chapter, we argue that in Australia there is now a well-constructed cultural imperative to breastfeed. The message of 'breast is best' is powerful and is transmitted through public health and professional discourses and increasingly within the broader social and cultural context influencing the personal decisions and experiences of women. Most women in Australia make the decision to initiate breastfeeding, yet many women abandon the practice within the first 6 weeks following the birth of their baby. It appears that personal commitment, prenatal preparation and support to initiate breastfeeding is not always enough to sustain breastfeeding. In this chapter, we assert that the current investment in promoting and supporting women to initiate breastfeeding in Australia is having little impact on the longevity of breastfeeding and, for many women, appears to be causing a high level of emotional distress. We argue that the current public health policy, professional and social investment in breastfeeding initiation may be better directed at providing appropriate support in the weeks following birth for women who wish to breastfeed (see also Chapter 5 in this volume). ¬© 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Sheehan, A. and Schmied, V.",0,1454
1816,The effectiveness of massage therapy in the treatment of infantile colic symptoms: A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Infantile colic, cry-fuss and sleep problems are transient in the initial months of life, but they contribute to maternal depression, parenting stress and family mental health problems. In this randomized clinical trial, we aimed to explore the efficacy of massage therapy compared to rocking in reducing infantile colic symptoms including duration and number of cries, sleep duration and severity of infant colic. Methods: This was a single blind RCT study with a one-week follow-up. One hundred colicky infants aged younger than 12 weeks old were randomly assigned into massage and rocking groups. Infants in the massage group received a massage for 15-20 minutes once during a day and once at night before sleeping for a week. In the control group, mothers rocked their infants gently for 5-25 minutes when the symptoms of colic appeared. Parents recorded the details of the colic symptoms in a diary every day. A GEE approach was applied to explore the effect of the intervention. Results: Efficiency of massage therapy was significantly higher than rocking. At the end of the study, the mean number of daily cries was 4.26¬±1.40 in the massage and 6.9¬±2.14 the rocking groups (p < 0.01). The mean of the severity score was 1.39¬±0.19 less in the massage group (p < 0.01). Moreover, the mean differences of massage and rocking groups were -0.82¬±0.20 hour (p < 0.01) and 0.72¬±0.35 (p= 0.04) in the duration of cries and duration of sleep, respectively. Conclusion: Massaging significantly improved colic symptoms during a one-week intervention for all outcomes. In addition, significant differences were found between the intervention and control groups in favor of massaging. Therefore, massage therapy is more effective than rocking for treating infant colic symptoms.","Sheidaei, A. and Abadi, A. and Zayeri, F. and Nahidi, F. and Gazerani, N. and Mansouri, A.",0,1455
1818,Reduced crying and favourable stool characteristics in Chinese infants fed milk fat-based formula,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chinese infants consuming four different commercially-available infant formulas were evaluated on gut comfort and stool consistency parameters. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Gut comfort characteristics were evaluated during a 7-day cross-sectional observational study in 409 healthy, term, exclusively formula-fed infants via questionnaires and fecal parameters. RESULTS: The stool consistency and color scores were different between the infants consuming one of the four commercially-available infant formulas including different fat sources, i.e. one milk fat-based (IF1), two structured vegetable fat blend-based (IF2 and IF4) and one palm oil-free vegetable fat blend-based (IF3). The scoring pattern showed more 'soft-formed' stools for IF1- consuming infants compared to infants consuming IF2, IF3 or IF4. In addition, a lower amount of green feces was observed in combination with an increase in golden-colored feces for IF1-consuming infants compared to the other groups. Furthermore, IF1-consuming infants reported less fussy/crying time during the night and less gut discomfort. Infants consuming milk fat-based IF1 showed significantly lower fatty acid soaps compared to palmoil free IF3-fed infants. CONCLUSIONS: Infants consuming milk fat-based IF1 experienced less gut discomfort compared to infants consuming other commercially-available infant formula. Lower fecal fatty acid soap levels, fussy/crying time during the night and gut discomfort were observed. These findings contribute to the current understanding of the association between lipid structure and gut comfort parameters. However, the suggested benefits noted cannot be fully linked to the effect of fat blend differences since formulas differ in ingredient-sourcing and processing. Future research should confirm the added benefit of milk fat-based infant formulas to improve gut comfort parameters.","Sheng, X. Y. and Buthmanaban, V. and Vonk, M. M. and Feitsma, A.

1819,Development of the prosodic features of infant vocalizing,"Studied developmental changes in the prosodic features of infant vocalizing with novel electroacoustic techniques. Complete and continuous recordings of all the vocalizations of 2 infants during the 1st 5 mo. of life were collected, beginning with the birth cries and continuing uninterrupted as the Ss were moved into plexiglass ""air-cribs"" at home. These recordings were systematically sampled for analysis. The prosodic features of vocalizing were analyzed by extracting 3 acoustic parameters: fundamental frequency (Hz.), amplitude (db.), and duration (msec.) during each of the 108 samples. Te outputs of the parameter extractors (analog electronic devices) were measured every 25 msec. by an analog-to-digital converter, then processed by an on-line digital computer. Composite statistics, describing the 3 prosodic features of the vocalizing in each sample, were plotted separately as a function of age at the time of sample. Parameter values and trends in the prosodic features of infant vocalization are reported. (28 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Sheppard, W. C. and Lane, H.

1820,Lactose-Free Milk or Soy-Based Formulas Do Not Improve Caregivers' Distress or Perceptions of Difficult Infant Behavior,"Objectives: The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that caregiver-reported difficulties in infant behavior and caregivers' distress will significantly improve on lactose-free (LF) milk-based or LF soy-based formulas compared with a milk-based, lactose-containing formula. Methods: In this double-blind randomized controlled trial, infants (mean age: 4.97 weeks) with caregiver-reported feeding problems on a milk-based lactose-containing formula were randomized to receive either LF milk-based (n = 96), LF soy-based (n = 97), or milk-based, lactose-containing (n = 103) formula. Study formula was infants' sole item of diet for 14 days. Infants' caregivers completed measures of infant behavior and caregivers' distress for the week preceding baseline and again for the week preceding the 14-day follow-up. Results: Infants who received LF milk or LF soy-based formulas did not significantly differ from those who received milk-based, lactose-containing formula on follow-up caregiver-reported measures of infant difficultness from the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire, F(2, 277) = 0.83, nor on measures of caregivers' distress, assessed with measures of caregivers' mental health and parenting efficacy, F(2, 285) = 0.73-1.07. Across the 3 formula groups, scores on outcome measures significantly improved from baseline to follow-up (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our study does not support LF milk or LF soy-based formulas to alleviate common infant behaviors such as fussiness, crying, or need for attention. Moreover, the data suggest that some difficulties in infant behaviors, as well as caregivers' distress and perceived efficacy in parenting difficult infants, may improve within a couple weeks of reporting difficulties to the pediatrician. ¬© 2015 by ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN.

1822,Predictors of maternal sensitivity during the early postpartum period,"Aim. This paper reports a study examining the relationship of maternal sensitivity to maternal identity, social support, maternal-fetal attachment and demographic variables. Background. Maternal sensitivity is a mother's ability to perceive and interpret accurately her infant's signals and communications, and then respond appropriately. It is one of the major influencing factors of mother-infant attachment, and needs to be promoted for effective mother-infant interaction. However, limited information is available on the factors that influence postpartum maternal sensitivity. The study was guided by Roy's adaptation model. Methods. A cross-sectional, descriptive design was used. A convenience sample of 196 Korean mothers within 6 weeks of delivery were recruited during July-November 2003 and completed a self-report questionnaire. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and stepwise multiple regression analysis. Results. We found that maternal-fetal attachment, self-identity as a mother, mother's employment status, identification with her baby, support from others, and infant's gestational age at birth were statistically significant predictors of maternal sensitivity postpartum. These variables explained 60% of the variance in maternal sensitivity. Conclusion. Providing social support, enhancing maternal identity, and facilitating maternal-fetal attachment in the antepartum period are recommended to improve postpartum maternal sensitivity. Also, in future research, a path-type model or structural equation model including other variables, such as postnatal depression, needs to be developed and tested for optimal adaptation to becoming a mother. ¬© 2006 The Authors.","Shin, H. and Park, Y.

1823,Relationship between circadian salivary melatonin levels and sleep-wake behavior in infants,"Background: There have been calls for more aggressive intervention for infants with failure in development of a sleep-wake rhythm. If development of the 'biological clock' in infants can be assessed by measuring melatonin, this may provide a useful indicator of the sleep-wake rhythm development. Thus, we investigated relationship between circadian salivary melatonin concentrations and sleep-wake behavioral parameters in infants. Methods: Sixty-seven mothers who had infants aged 3-15 months were requested to record sleep-wake behavior of their baby for 2 days, and to collect their baby's saliva four times daily in the morning (06:00-09:00 h), noon (11:00-13:00 h), evening (16:00-18:00 h), and night (19:00-22:00 h) for measurement of melatonin concentrations by ELISA. Results: The mean melatonin concentrations of the saliva were: morning 40 ¬± 4 pg/mL, noon 14 ¬± 3 pg/mL, evening 15 ¬± 3 pg/mL, and night 23 ¬± 4 pg/mL. The melatonin concentrations, at each measurement point, were highest in infants aged 3-5 months, and decreased as age increased. Morning melatonin concentrations showed a negative correlation with nocturnal sleep duration (P < 0.05). Increased morning concentrations were related to early waking time (P < 0.05). In infants with open air baths on most days, evening and night melatonin concentrations were significantly lower (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Salivary melatonin concentrations in infants between 06:00 and 22:00 decreased by age, and elevation of morning values may indicate an immature sleep-wake rhythm. Frequent open air baths may contribute to decreased melatonin levels. ¬© 2011 Japan Pediatric Society.","Shinohara, H. and Kodama, H.",0,1461

1828,"Study protocol: An investigation of mother-infant signalling during breastfeeding using a randomised trial to test the effectiveness of breastfeeding relaxation therapy on maternal psychological state, breast milk production and infant behaviour and growth","Background: The physiological and psychological signalling between mother and infant during lactation is one of the prominent mother-infant factors that may influence breastfeeding outcomes. The infant can 'signal' his needs through vocalisation, and the mother can respond by allowing or restricting nipple access, which might alter the breast milk composition or volume. This may lead to parent-offspring conflict during the lactation period. Challenging infant behaviour has also been associated with maternal psychological distress, which might affect breastfeeding performance. Most attempts to improve breastfeeding rates focus on providing additional support, yet many aspects of the breastfeeding process are poorly understood. Thus, our objective is to investigate mother-infant signalling during breastfeeding by manipulating maternal psychological state using a relaxation therapy intervention. The study will test the hypothesis that mothers who listen to the therapy will be more relaxed/less stressed and this will favourably alter breast milk composition and/or affect milk volume and hence influence infant outcomes. Methods: A randomised controlled trial will be conducted in first-time breastfeeding mothers and their new-born infants. Pregnant mothers will be recruited at antenatal clinics in Selangor, Malaysia, and four home visits will be carried out at 2, 6, 12 and 14 weeks postnatally. Participants will be randomised into a control and an intervention group in the early post-partum period. Mothers from the intervention group will be asked to listen daily to an audio recording with relaxation therapy during breastfeeding. Maternal psychological state, breastfeeding practices and infant behaviour will be assessed using validated questionnaires. Milk volume will be measured using stable isotopes. Breast milk samples will be collected to measure macronutrient content and hormone levels. Anthropometric measurements (weight, length and head circumference) will be performed during all home visits, including body composition at week 14. Discussion: The main outcomes will be the effect of the intervention on maternal psychological state, milk production, cortisol levels, and infant behaviour and growth. Secondary outcomes will be associations between breast milk composition and infant appetite and growth. This study aims to provide a greater understanding of maternal-infant factors which influence breastfeeding outcomes and which may be useful targets for future interventions. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).","Shukri, N.

1832,Parent-child co-sleeping in children with co-morbid conditions and sleep-disordered breathing,"PURPOSE: Co-sleeping is common in children with co-morbid conditions. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence and determinants of parent-child co-sleeping in children with co-morbid conditions and sleep-disordered breathing and the impact on parental sleep. METHODS: Parents of consecutive children undergoing a sleep study filled in a questionnaire on co-sleeping. RESULTS: The parents of 166 children (80 boys, median age 5.7¬†years (0.5-21) participated in this study. The most common co-morbid conditions of the children were Down syndrome (17%), achondroplasia (11%), and Chiari malformation (8%). The prevalence of parent-child co-sleeping was 46%. Reasons for co-sleeping were mainly reactive and included child's demand (39%), crying (19%), nightmares (13%), medical reason (34%), parental reassuring or comforting (27%), and/or over-crowding (21%). Sixty-eight percent of parents reported that co-sleeping improved their sleep quality because of reassurance/comforting (67%), reduced nocturnal awakening (23%), and child supervision (44%). Forty percent of parents reported that co-sleeping decreased their sleep quality because of nocturnal awakenings or early wake up, or difficulties initiating sleep (by 77% and 52% of parents, respectively), whereas both positive and negative associations were reported by 29% of the parents. Co-sleeping was more common with children <‚Äâ2¬†years of age as compared to older children (p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Parent-child co-sleeping is common in children with co-morbid conditions and sleep-disordered breathing. Co-sleeping was mainly reactive and had both positive and negative associations with parental sleep quality. Co-sleeping should be discussed on an individual basis with the parents in order to improve the sleep quality of the family.","Sidhoum, L. and Amaddeo, A. and Arroyo, J.

1833,"The link between infant regulatory problems, temperament traits, maternal depressive symptoms and children's psychopathological symptoms at age three: A longitudinal study in a German at-risk sample","Background: Difficult conditions during childhood can limit an individual's development in many ways. Factors such as being raised in an at-risk family, child temperamental traits or maternal traits can potentially influence a child's later behaviour. The present study investigated the extent of regulatory problems in 6-month-old infants and their link to temperamental traits and impact on externalizing and internalizing problems at 36 months. Moderating effects of maternal distress and maternal depressive symptoms were tested as well. Methods: In a quasi-experimental, longitudinal study, a sample of 185 mother-infant dyads at psychosocial risk was investigated at 6 months with SFS (infants' regulatory problems) and at 3 years with CBCL (children's behavioural problems), EAS (children's temperament), ADS (maternal depressive symptoms) and PSI-SF (maternal stress). Results: A hierarchical regression analysis yielded a significant association between infants' regulatory problems and both externalizing and internalizing behaviour problems at age 3 (accounting for 16% and 14% variance), with both externalizing and internalizing problems being linked to current maternal depressive symptoms (12 and 9% of the variance). Externalizing and internalizing problems were found to be related also to children's temperamental difficulty (18 and 13% of variance) and their negative emotionality. With temperamental traits having been taken into account, only feeding problems at 6 months contributed near-significant to internalizing problems at 3 years. Conclusions: Our results underscore the crucial role of temperament in the path between early regulatory problems and subsequent behavioural difficulties. Children's unfavourable temperamental predispositions such as negative emotionality and generally ""difficult temperament"" contributed substantially to both externalizing and internalizing behavioural problems in the high-risk sample. The decreased predictive power of regulatory problems following the inclusion of temperamental variables indicates a mediation effect of temperamental traits in the path between early regulatory problems and subsequent behavioural problems. Our results support the main effects of a child's temperament, and to some degree maternal depressive symptoms, rather than the diathesis stress model of interaction between risky environment and temperamental traits.

1836,Magnitude knowledge: The common core of numerical development,"The integrated theory of numerical development posits that a central theme of numerical development from infancy to adulthood is progressive broadening of the types and ranges of numbers whose magnitudes are accurately represented. The process includes four overlapping trends: (1) representing increasingly precisely the magnitudes of non-symbolic numbers, (2) connecting small symbolic numbers to their non-symbolic referents, (3) extending understanding from smaller to larger whole numbers, and (4) accurately representing the magnitudes of rational numbers. The present review identifies substantial commonalities, as well as differences, in these four aspects of numerical development. With both whole and rational numbers, numerical magnitude knowledge is concurrently correlated with, longitudinally predictive of, and causally related to multiple aspects of mathematical understanding, including arithmetic and overall math achievement. Moreover, interventions focused on increasing numerical magnitude knowledge often generalize to other aspects of mathematics. The cognitive processes of association and analogy seem to play especially large roles in this development. Thus, acquisition of numerical magnitude knowledge can be seen as the common core of numerical development. Acquisition of increasingly precise representations of the magnitudes of an increasing range of numbers is a unifying theme of numerical development from infancy to adulthood. The acquisitions involve representing increasingly precisely the magnitudes of non-symbolic numbers, connecting small symbolic numbers to their non-symbolic referents, extending understanding from smaller to larger whole numbers, and accurately representing the magnitudes of rational numbers. The precision of children's knowledge of numerical magnitudes is correlated with, predictive of, and causally related to a variety of important outcomes, including arithmetic learning. ¬© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Siegler, R.

1837,Infantile colic associated with childhood migraine: A prospective cohort study,"Purpose To explore the association between infantile colic and adolescent migraine. Method In a randomized general population sample, families expecting their first child were prospectively followed for infantile colic and adolescent migraine. Results Colic was diagnosed in 160 (13%) of 1267 infants until the age of 3 months. Migraine was ascertained in 129 (16%) of 787 adolescents at age 18 years. History of infantile colic was identified in 96 (12%) of 787 adolescents and no such history in 658 (88%) of 787 adolescents. Migraine was present in 22 (23%)/96 adolescents who had a history of infantile colic, but in only 74 (11%)/658 ones who had no such history. Of the 22 adolescents, 14 (64%) had migraine without aura and eight (36%) had migraine with aura. Infants with colic had an almost three-fold risk (risk ratio 2.8, 95% confidence interval 1.2-6.5) for adolescent migraine without aura, but no increased risk for migraine with aura (0.8, 0.3-2.2). Discussion and conclusions Infantile colic seems to be associated with an increased risk for migraine without aura, but not for migraine with aura. Whether infantile colic per se is a type of infantile migraine or an antecedent of future migraine remains to be answered by further research. ¬© 2015 International Headache Society.","Sillanp√§√§, M. and Saarinen, M.",0,1470
1838,Mental health of children exposed to intimate partner violence against their mother: A longitudinal study from Brazil,"Background: Exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) is an important adverse childhood experience, but there are few longitudinal studies in low and middle-income countries. Objective: To investigate the consequences of exposure to IPV for a child's mental health. Participants and setting: 614 mother-child pairs were evaluated in a poor urban district in Recife, northeastern Brazil. Methods: Women were interviewed in pregnancy, postpartum and six to nine years after delivery, and asked about their experience of IPV, and the exposure of their child to violence. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was completed by child's mother and teacher. Ten types of child experience of IPV and the age of onset of exposure were compared with the child's behavioral profile at school age. Results: The mothers reported that 372/614 (60.6%) children had been exposed to IPV. The commonest types of child exposure to IPV were ‚Äúprenatally‚Äù ‚Äúoverheard‚Äù ‚Äúeyewitnessed‚Äù and 10.0% of children were physically or verbally involved in the IPV. Mothers reported high SDQ Total Difficulties scores in 71.7% of all children exposed to IPV and teachers in 59.8%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated the strongest association with behavioral difficulties was with exposure to IPV in the age group 1‚Äì2 years (OR 2.5 [95% CI: 1.3‚Äì4.8]). Conclusion: Young children are sensitive to the age of first exposure to IPV and to the type of IPV. Interventions to reduce IPV should be targeted on vulnerable women from poor urban communities during their pregnancies and in the first two years of their child's life. ¬© 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Silva, E.

1839,Differing structural properties of foods affect the development of mandibular control and muscle coordination in infants and young children,"The development of chewing is an essential motor skill that is continually refined throughout early childhood. From a motor control perspective, the advancement of textures is dependent upon the fit between a child's oral anatomic and motor system and food properties. The purpose of this exploratory study is to identify age-related changes in chewing motor coordination and control and to determine if these changes are associated with the differing structural properties of solid foods, as well as to explore the role of explanatory variables such as the emergence of teeth and bite force. The masticatory muscle coordination (i.e., coupling of synergistic and antagonistic muscle pairs) and control (i.e., speed, displacement, chewing rate, duration, and number of chews) of fifty children were assessed cross-sectionally at five ages: 9-, 12-, 18-, 24-, and 36-months using electromyography (EMG) and 3D optical motion capture while children ate three foods that had differing structural properties. The results of this study found that children made gains in their chewing motor control (decreased duration of chewing sequences and lateral jaw displacement) and coordination (improved jaw muscle coupling) throughout this period. The structural differences in foods also affected chewing performance at all ages. These preliminary findings suggest that some solid textures are better adapted for immature mandibular control than others and that the development of chewing is a protracted process that may be impacted by the emergence of teeth and changes to bite force. ¬© 2018 The Authors","Simione, M. and Loret, C. and Le R√©v√©rend, B. and Richburg, B. and Del Valle, M. and Adler, M. and Moser, M. and Green, J.

1842,Association of infant feeding patterns with taste preferences in european children and adolescents: A retrospective latent profile analysis,"The aim was to investigate associations between the duration of infant feeding practices (FP) and taste preferences (TP) in European children and adolescents. A total of 5526 children (6-16 years old) of the I.Family study completed a Food and Beverage Preference Questionnaire to measure their preferences for sweet, fatty and bitter tastes. Mothers retrospectively reported the FPs duration in months: exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), exclusive formula milk feeding (EFMF), combined breastfeeding (BF&FMF) and the age at the introduction of complementary foods (CF). Using logistic regression analyses and latent class analysis (latent profiles of FP and CF were identified), we explored associations between profiles and TP, adjusting for various covariates, including the Healthy Diet Adherence Score (HDAS). A total of 48% of children had short durations of EBF (‚â§4 months) and BF&FMF (‚â§6 months) and were introduced to CF early (<6 months). No significant relationship was observed between the single FPs and TP, even when considering common profiles of FP. HDAS was inversely associated with sweet and fatty TP, but positively with bitter TP. Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not observe associations between FP and children‚Äôs TP later in life. Further studies with higher FP variation and longitudinal design are needed to investigate the causal associations between infant FP and taste preferences later in life. ¬© 2019 by the authors.

1843,"Functional and behavioral responses as marker of illness, and outcome in infants under 2 months","Value of abnormal findings on 11 functional and behavioral items were studied for identification of serious illness, presence of bacteremia and prediction of the outcome (recovery or death) in infants upto 2 months of age. All the items were graded on a 3 point scale (0, 1 and 2) in the ascending order of severity. A total of 116 infants who were being evaluated for suspected sepsis were enrolled. The assessment was completed before detailed history and physical examination. Significant associations were observed between presence of serious illness and six items by lambda2-test and/or Pearson's correlation and multiple stepwise regression analysis. These were decreased activity, abnormal quality of cry, presence of pallor, fast breathing, decreased consolability, and consciousness level. The sensitivity of six item model was > 90% and negative predictive value >95%. The negative predictive value of several individual items was also above 90%. Consciousness level was the most important predictor of the outcome followed by poor feeding, hydration, color, consolability and abnormal expression (combined multiple R = 0.51). A total score of 7 or more on above six items had a sensitivity of 80%, and negative predictive value of 97% for death. In conclusion, behavior and functional responses (as mentioned above) were fairly useful in predicting the outcome and/or the severity of the illness. These items may be combined to develop a scale to help in therapeutic decision making.","Singhi, S. and Chaudhuri, M.",0,1474
1844,Identification of neonatal hearing impairment: auditory brain stem responses in the perinatal period,"OBJECTIVES: 1) To describe the auditory brain stem response (ABR) measurement system and optimized methods used for study of newborn hearing screening. 2) To determine how recording and infant factors related to the screening, using well-defined, specific ABR outcome measures. DESIGN: Seven thousand one hundred seventy-nine infants, 4478 from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the remaining from the well-baby nursery, were evaluated with an automated ABR protocol in each ear. Two channel recordings were obtained (vertex to mastoid or channel A and vertex to nape of neck or channel B) in response to click stimuli of 30 and 69 dB nHL in all infants as well as 50 dB nHL in infants who did not meet criteria for response at 30 dB. Criteria for response included F(SP) > or =3.1 and a tester-judgment of response. Criteria could be met in the first or repeat test with a maximum of 6144 accepted sweeps per test. RESULTS: More than 99% of infants could complete the ABR protocol. More than 90% of NICU and well-baby nursery infants ""passed"" given the strict criteria for response, whereas 86% of those with high risk factors met criterion for ABR response detection. The number of infants who did not meet ABR response criteria in one or both ears was systematically related to stimulus level with the largest group not meeting criteria at 30 dB followed by 50 and 69 dB nHL. Meeting criteria on the ABR was positively correlated with the amplitude of wave V, with low noise and low electrode impedance. Factors that predicted how many sweeps would be needed to reach criterion F(SP) included noise level of the test site, state of the baby (for example, quiet sleep versus crying), recording noise, electrode impedance and response latency. Channel A (vertex to mastoid) reached criterion more often than channel B (vertex to nape of neck) due to higher noise in channel B. Average total test time for 30 dB nHL screening in both ears was under 8 minutes. Well babies with risk factors took slightly longer to evaluate than other groups with this automated ABR procedure and have higher noise levels. CONCLUSIONS: ABR implemented with an automated detection algorithm using a 30 dB nHL click stimulus is reliable technique for rapid assessment of auditory status in newborns. Factors other than hearing loss that influenced the test result include infant state, electrode location and impedance, testing site, and infant risk status. Even so, ABRs were reliably recorded in the vast majority of babies under circumstances in which most babies are found in the perinatal period.","Sininger, Y. S. and Cone-Wesson, B. and Folsom, R.

STUDY DESIGN: The study period of this randomized control trial was October 2012 through March 2014. Following informed consent, full-term males from uncomplicated singleton pregnancies were randomized to Gomco (n=137) or Mogen (n=137) devices. Resident-wide education for an obstetrics and gynecology residency program at a single institution was performed to ensure standardized training. All infants received a subcutaneous ring block before the procedure and oral sucrose intraoperatively. The primary outcome was neonatal pain assessed physiologically by salivary cortisol levels (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and clinically by a validated neonatal pain score (crying, requires increased oxygen administration, increased vital signs, expression, sleeplessness [CRIES]). Secondary outcomes were immediate complications, duration of procedure, and short-term outcomes as reported by mothers and pediatricians.

1846,Pacifiers and Exclusive Breastfeeding: Does Risk for Postpartum Depression Modify the Association?,"Background: Postpartum depression is associated with lower rates of breastfeeding. Evidence describing the effect of pacifiers on breastfeeding is inconsistent, and previous research suggests that pacifiers may help vulnerable mothers breastfeed. Research aim: This study aimed to determine (a) how receiving a pacifier in the hospital affects exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) at 1 week and 3 months postpartum and (b) whether this association is modified by risk for postpartum depression (PPD). Methods: Data were derived from Listening to Mothers III. We included participants (n = 1,349) who intended to breastfeed and delivered at term. Mothers were considered at high risk for PPD if they reported feeling the need to receive treatment for depression during pregnancy. We used weighted multivariable logistic regression models to adjust for covariates. Results: Receiving a pacifier in the hospital was not significantly associated with EBF at 1 week (odds ratio [OR] = 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.62, 1.12]) but was significantly associated with lower odds of EBF at 3 months postpartum (OR = 0.72, 95% CI [0.54, 0.95]). Risk for PPD modified this association. Among mothers at high risk for PPD, receiving a pacifier was significantly associated with increased odds of EBF (OR = 3.31, 95% CI [1.23, 8.97] at 1 week and OR = 5.27, 95% CI [1.97, 14.12] at 3 months)","Sipsma, H.

1847,Infant difficult behaviors in the context of perinatal biomedical conditions and early child environment,"Background: Problems experienced within the first year of an infant's life can be precursors of later mental health conditions. The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency and continuity of difficult behaviors in infants at 3 and 6 months of age and the associations of these difficulties with biomedical and psychosocial factors.Methods: This study was a part of an ongoing prospective birth-cohort study. Study participants were 189 uniparous mothers and their full-term newborns. The index of infant difficult behavior was constructed. This index was then associated with the following factors: delivery mode, newborn function after birth, maternal emotional well-being, risk behavior, subjective evaluation of the quality of the relationship of the couple, and attitudes toward infant-rearing.Results: Common difficult behaviors, including crying, sleeping and eating problems, were characteristic for 30.2% of 3 month old and for 22.2% of 6 month old full-term infants. The expression of infant difficult behaviors at the age of 3 months increased the likelihood of the expression of these difficulties at 6 months by more than 5 times. Factors including younger maternal age, poor prenatal and postnatal emotional well-being, prenatal alcohol consumption, low satisfaction with the couple's relationship before pregnancy, and deficiency of infant-centered maternal attitudes towards infant-rearing increased the likelihood of difficult behaviors in infants at the age of 3 months. Low maternal satisfaction with the relationship of the couple before pregnancy, negative emotional reactions of both parents toward pregnancy (as reported by the mother) and the deficiency of an infant-centered maternal attitude towards infant-rearing increased the likelihood of infant difficult behaviors continuing between the ages of 3 to 6 months. Perinatal biomedical conditions were not related to the difficult behaviors in infants.Conclusions: Our study suggests that early onset of difficult behavior highly increases the risk for the continuation of difficult behavior during infancy. In general, the impact of prenatal psychosocial environment on infant behavior decreases from the ages of 3 to 6 months","Sirvinskiene, G. and Zemaitiene, N. and Zaborskis, A. and Markuniene, E. and Jusiene, R.",0,1478
1848,Transitions in infants' and toddlers' beverage patterns,"Objective: To describe transitions and patterns in infants' and toddlers' beverage intakes, with focus on nonmilk beverages. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted by telephone to obtain a 24-hour dietary recall of infants' and toddlers' food intakes, as reported by mothers or other primary caregivers. Subjects: A nationwide sample of infants and toddlers (n=3,022) ages 4 to 24 months, who participated in the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS). Analyses: Beverages were categorized as total milks (ie, breast milk, infant formulas, cow's milk, soy milk, goat's milk), 100% juices, fruit drinks, carbonated beverages, water, and ""other."" Analyses included means ¬± standard deviations, percentages, frequencies, nutrient densities, and linear regression. Results: Beverages provided 84% of total daily food energy for infants 4 to 6 months of age, decreasing to 36% at ages 19 to 24 months. Apple juice and apple-flavored fruit drinks were the most frequently consumed beverages in the 100% juice and fruit drink categories, respectively. Juices, fruit drinks, and carbonated beverages appeared to displace milk in toddlers' diets (P<.0001). Applications/Conclusions: This research shows that beverages make important contributions to infants' and toddlers' energy and nutrient needs, but they must be wisely chosen. Registered dietitians should advise parents and caregivers that excessive intakes of any beverage, including milks and 100% juices, may displace other foods and beverages in the diet and/or contribute to excess food energy (kcal). Further research is needed to define excessive amounts in each beverage category, and such guidance could be very useful to parents and caregivers of infants and toddlers.","Skinner, J.

1849,A pilot study of ST36 acupuncture for infantile colic,"Objective To conduct a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a proposed design of an acupuncture trial to relieve symptoms of infantile colic. Method An open randomised single-blinded controlled trial, using standardised bilateral treatment of the acupuncture point ST36. Infants fulfilling Wessel's definition of infantile colic were included. Patients were randomised to active treatment or to no-treatment control. General practitioners (GPs) educated in Western medical acupuncture did the interventions. Parents and GPs' assistants were blinded. Active treatment was the bilateral insertion of 0.20√ó15 mm Seirin needles to 12 mm depth at ST36. The intervention consisted of daily treatments of 30 s duration for three consecutive workdays. Blinding was done with a red point mark on the skin and circular adhesive dressing covering. The parents were asked two blinding validation questions in the course of the study period. The primary end point was the effect of the intervention assessed as change in crying time per 24 h measured with a crying registration form. Results The authors improved the standardisation and changed the blinding procedure as a result of the pilot study. Blinding validation questions were considered necessary. The changes made in the main study protocol are discussed. Conclusion The pilot study led to important changes that were implemented into the final trial protocol. Blinding validation is essential in no-treatment controlled trials of acupuncture on infants, where the parents are blinded assessors of symptom reduction. The authors suggest that blinding validation questions, and the answers to these questions, should be reported.

Infants' sleep patterns were assessed by a 1-week diary and by interviews with parents before hospital admission, 1 week and 2 months after discharge. The intervention was based on correction of day-sleep rhythm, support of self-comforting capabilities of the infant, and education of parents in regard to the infants' characteristics and developmental status. Changes in day naps and infant irritability over daytime also improved significantly. FINDINGS: Night sleep improved significantly 1 week after discharge and even more so 2 months later.

Seventy-nine sleep disturbed outpatients with day and night sleep problems were investigated before and two weeks after a brief sleep intervention. Data were collected by interviewing parents on their infants' day and night sleep patterns. Besides instructing the parents on night sleep regulation, they were advised to regulate day sleep. After the intervention, duration of day and night sleep increased and frequency of night waking decreased. The mean duration of the first waking period in the morning did not change, but the range decreased. The mean duration of the last waking period in the evening increased. The frequency of short and irregular day naps and the need for assistance in falling asleep decreased after the intervention. It is recommended that the last waking before night sleep is lengthened to reduce day and night sleep problems. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

1858,Safety and tolerability of Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis EVC001 supplementation in healthy term breastfed infants: A phase I clinical trial,"Background: Historically, bifidobacteria were the dominant intestinal bacteria in breastfed infants. Still abundant in infants in developing nations, levels of intestinal bifidobacteria are low among infants in developed nations. Recent studies have described an intimate relationship between human milk and a specific subspecies of Bifidobacterium, B. longum subsp. infantis (B. infantis), yet supplementation of breastfed, healthy, term infants with this organism, has not been reported. The IMPRINT Study, a Phase I clinical trial, was initiated to determine the safety and tolerability of supplementing breastfed infants with B. infantis (EVC001). Methods: Eighty mother-infant dyads were enrolled in either lactation support plus B. infantis supplementation (BiLS) or lactation support alone (LS). Starting with Day 7 postnatal, BiLS infants were fed 1.8-2.8 √ó 1010 CFU B. infantis EVC001 daily in breast milk for 21 days. Mothers collected fecal samples, filled out health questionnaires, and kept daily logs about their infants' feeding and gastrointestinal symptoms from birth until Day 61 postnatal. Safety and tolerability were determined from maternal reports. Results: There were no differences in the mean gestational age at birth, weight 1 and 2 months postnatal, and breast milk intake between groups. The mean Log10 change in fecal Bifidobacterium from Day 6 to Day 28 was higher (p = 0.0002) for BiLS (6.6 ¬± 2.8 SD) than for LS infants (3.5 ¬± 3.5 SD).

1860,Associations between lifetime stress exposure and prenatal health behaviors,"Prenatal health behaviors can strongly influence risk of poor pregnancy birth outcomes. Although stress has been implicated in structuring the likelihood that individuals will engage in various prenatal health behavior patterns, no studies to date have examined life stress exposure occurring across the entire lifespan, and few have investigated how different types of stressors are comparatively associated with these outcomes. To address these issues, we interviewed 164 women at one of two large Midwestern, urban hospitals after delivering their first infant. We used the Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN) to assess women's lifetime stress exposure severity and ordinary least squares regression models to examine associations between participants' life stress exposure and prenatal health behaviors. As hypothesized, greater lifetime stress exposure was associated with engaging in more negative prenatal health behaviors and fewer positive prenatal health behaviors while controlling for relevant sociodemographic factors and current perceived stress levels. These effects were stronger for negative versus positive health behaviors, and they differed substantially as a function of stressor type, exposure timing, and primary life domain. Stressors occurring over the life course thus have negative consequences for prenatal health behaviors, but these effects are not uniform across different types of life stress exposure. ¬© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","Smith, T. and Johns-Wolfe, E. and Shields, G.

1863,Combined spinal - Epidural anesthesia in major abdominal surgery in high-risk neonates and infants,"Background: Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia (CSE-A) is reportedly safe and effective for the pediatric population in infraumbilical surgery. Our main purpose was to describe our experience of this technique in neonates and infants undergoing elective major upper abdominal surgery. Methods: Spinal anesthesia was performed in 28 neonates and infants with isobaric bupivacaine 0.5%, 1 mg¬∑kg-1 followed by placement of a caudal epidural catheter to thoracic spinal segments. The catheter tip position was confirmed radiographically. Respiratory and hemodynamic data were collected before and after the CSE-A and throughout the operation, as a measure of anesthetic effectiveness. Complications related to the anesthesia technique were collected as a measure of the anesthetic technique safety. Results: Satisfactory surgical anesthesia was achieved in 24 neonates and infants, four patients were converted to general anesthesia. Respiratory and hemodynamic variables did not change significantly during surgery, compared with baseline values: oxygen saturation (P = 0.07), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (P = 0.143, P = 0.198 respectively), heart rate (P = 0.080) and respiratory rate (P = 0.127).

1864,Mitofusin 1 and optic atrophy 1 shift metabolism to mitochondrial respiration during aging,"Replicative and chronological lifespan are two different modes of cellular aging. Chronological lifespan is defined as the duration during which quiescent normal cells retain their capacity to re-enter the proliferative cycle. This study investigated whether changes in metabolism occur during aging of quiescent normal human fibroblasts (NHFs) and the mechanisms that regulate these changes. Bioenergetics measurements were taken in quiescent NHFs from younger (newborn, 3-day, 5-month, and 1-year) and older (58-, 61-, 63-, 68-, and 70-year) healthy donors as well as NHFs from the same individual at different ages (29, 36, and 46¬†years). Results show significant changes in cellular metabolism during aging of quiescent NHFs: Old NHFs exhibit a significant decrease in glycolytic flux and lactate levels, and increase in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ATP levels compared to young NHFs. Results from the Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test show that old NHFs with a lower Bioenergetic Health Index (BHI) are more prone to oxidative stress compared to young NHFs with a higher BHI. The increase in OCR in old NHFs is associated with a shift in mitochondrial dynamics more toward fusion. Genetic knockdown of mitofusin 1 (MFN1) and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) in old NHFs decreased OCR and shifted metabolism more toward glycolysis. Downregulation of MFN1 and OPA1 also suppressed the radiation-induced increase in doubling time of NHFs. In summary, results show that a metabolic shift from glycolysis in young to mitochondrial respiration in old NHFs occurs during chronological lifespan, and MFN1 and OPA1 regulate this process. ¬© 2017 The Authors.

1865,Smoking during pregnancy and infantile colic,"Objective. To evaluate the association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and infantile colic (IC). Methods. A follow-up study of singleton infants delivered by Danish mothers at the Aarhus University Hospital from May 1991 to February 1992 and still living in the municipality of Aarhus at the age of 8 months was conducted. A total of 1820 mothers and their infants were included. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data on smoking, other lifestyle factors, and sociodemographic variables at 16 and 30 weeks of gestation and 8 months postpartum. IC was defined in the 8-month questionnaire and based on Wessel's criteria, except that we used only the crying criterion. Results. IC was seen in 10.8% of all infants. We observed a twofold increased risk of IC among infants whose mothers smoked 15 or more cigarettes per day during their pregnancy(relative risk: 2.1","S√∏ndergaard, C. and Henriksen, T.

1867,Fetal growth and infantile colic,"Aim - To describe how fetal growth and gestational age affect infantile colic, while considering other potential risk factors. Study design - A population based follow up study of 2035 healthy singleton infants without any disability born to Danish mothers. Information was collected by self administered questionnaires at 16 and 30 weeks of gestation, at delivery, and 8 months post partum. Infantile colic is defined according to Wessel's criteria, but symptoms are restricted to crying for more than three hours a day, for more than three days a week, and for more than three weeks. Results - The cumulated incidence of infantile colic was 10.9%. Low birth weight babies (< 2500 g) had more than twice the risk (odds ratio = 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 6.1) of infantile colic when controlled for gestational age, maternal height, and smoking. Conclusion - Low birth weight may be associated with infantile colic, and further research will be aimed to focus on fetal growth and infantile colic.","S√∏ndergaard, C. and Skajaa, E. and Henriksen, T.

1868,SAFETY OF A CRM197-CONJUGATED HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE B VACCINE IN KOREAN CHILDREN,"Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a major cause of meningitis and pneumonia with high morbidity and mortality rates in young children. The introduction of effective and well-tolerated conjugate Hib vaccines, has nearly eradicated this disease in many countries. We investigated the safety of the Hib PRP-CRM197 vaccine in a multi-center post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study. Korean children (N = 764) aged 1-33 months were enrolled when receiving a routine primary immunization or a booster vaccine with Hib PRP-CRM197 and solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded using a diary card for 7 and 28 days after each vaccination, respectively. In this study, AEs were reported by 66% of subjects but were generally mild, with 42% of subjects reporting solicited AEs and 46% reporting unsolicited AEs. Among the unsolicited AEs, 98% were determined to be unrelated to the study vaccine. The studied Hib PRP-CRM197 vaccine was well tolerated by the study group and found to have a similar safety profile to that reported in other clinical studies. This vaccine is suitable for routine immunization against Hib disease among Korean children. AEs due to this vaccine will continue to be monitored.","Song, H. and Bock, H. and Guadagno, A. and Costantini, M. and Baehner, F. and Kim, Y. H. and Ahn, S. I. and Son, K. H. and Yim, D. S.",0,1493

1870,Duration of exclusive breastfeeding may be related to eating behaviour and dietary intake in obesity prone normal weight young children,"Infants who are breastfed are introduced to a variety of flavours from the maternal milk, and thus the transition from maternal milk to complementary foods may be easier for these children. The aim of this study was to investigate if duration of exclusive breastfeeding was associated with pickiness or dietary intake of vegetables, fruit, starchy foods or sugar sweetened beverages among obesity prone normal weight children aged 2‚Äì6 years. This cohort study was based on data from the Healthy Start primary intervention study, the Danish Medical Birth registry and the Danish Health Visitor‚Äôs Child Health Database. Infant feeding was registered by health nurses while home-visiting the mother and child up to four times within the first year. Information on eating behaviour and diet intake at age 2‚Äì6 years was obtained by parents. Crude and adjusted logistic and general linear regression models were used to investigate associations. A total of 236 children had complete information on all variables. Data showed lower odds of picky eating behaviour when exclusively breastfed until age 4‚Äì5 months compared to exclusively breastfed for 0‚Äì1 months (OR = 0.35, 95CI = 0.16","Specht, I.

1871,A reliable pain assessment tool for clinical assessment in the neonatal intensive care unit,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to validate a clinician-friendly pain assessment tool for all groups of critically ill infants cared for in the specific neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) studied. DESIGN: A prospective study was undertaken to test the Pain Assessment Tool (PAT). Interrater reliability of the PAT score was assessed by two nurses who simultaneously determined an infant's PAT score. The PAT was validated against the CRIES score--crying, requires increased oxygen administration, increased vital signs, expression, sleeplessness--and the mother's assessment of her infant's discomfort using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). SETTING: The NICUs at two children's hospitals. PATIENTS: Participants were 144 preterm and term infants. Infants on a ventilator and those who had undergone surgery were included. RESULTS: The interrater reliability of the PAT was .85 with a mean difference of 0.17 (standard deviation: 1.73). There was a strong correlation between the PAT and CRIES scores (r = 0.76) and a moderate correlation (.38) between the PAT score and the VAS scores of the infant's mother. The correlation coefficient between the PAT score and CRIES score was significant for all groups (p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The PAT score was shown in this study to be a valid, reliable, and clinician-friendly pain assessment measurement tool for all infants nursed in the NICU.","Spence, K. and Gillies, D. and Harrison, D. and Johnston, L. and Nagy, S.",0,1496
1872,Dorsal penile nerve block in neonatal circumcision: chloroprocaine versus lidocaine,"Dorsal penile nerve blocking (DPNB) has been used with success in decreasing neonatal stress during circumcision. This study was designed to confirm the effectiveness of lidocaine in DPNB and to demonstrate that chloroprocaine, a shorter acting anesthetic, is as effective in blocking circumcision stress as lidocaine, but, because of its shorter plasma elimination half-life and time of onset of action, is safer. Five groups of 15 neonates were matched for weight, age, and Apgar scores and randomly assigned to a control group, one lidocaine group and three chloroprocaine groups with 2-, 3- and 5-minute postinjection waiting periods. Each neonate was subjected to six events during circumcision for which heart rate, tissue oxygenation, and cry duration were recorded. We found that, as in previous investigations, DPNB with lidocaine was effective in reducing neonatal stress, as was evident from decreased excursion from baseline heart rate, tissue oxygenation, and cry duration when compared with the control group (nonblocked). Furthermore, chloroprocaine DPNB approximates the effectiveness of lidocaine, as was evident from decreased change from baseline cry duration, tissue oxygenation, and heart rate during the most stressful events, particularly in the 3-minute wait chloroprocaine group. This more rapid onset of regional anesthesia decreases DPNB circumcision time and benefits patients, parents, and physicians.","Spencer, D. M. and Miller, K. A. and O'Quin, M. and Tomsovic, J.

1876,CaV1.2 calcium channel dysfunction causes a multisystem disorder including arrhythmia and autism,"CaV1.2, the cardiac L-type calcium channel, is important for excitation and contraction of the heart. Its role in other tissues is unclear. Here we present Timothy syndrome, a novel disorder characterized by multiorgan dysfunction including lethal arrhythmias, webbing of fingers and toes, congenital heart disease, immune deficiency, intermittent hypoglycemia, cognitive abnormalities, and autism. In every case, Timothy syndrome results from the identical, de novo CaV1.2 missense mutation G406R. Ca V1.2 is expressed in all affected tissues. Functional expression reveals that G406R produces maintained inward Ca2+ currents by causing nearly complete loss of voltage-dependent channel inactivation. This likely induces intracellular Ca2+ overload in multiple cell types. In the heart, prolonged Ca2+ current delays cardiomyocyte repolarization and increases risk of arrhythmia, the ultimate cause of death in this disorder. These discoveries establish the importance of CaV1.2 in human physiology and development and implicate Ca2+ signaling in autism.","Splawski, I. and Timothy, K. W. and Sharpe, L.

1878,Links between maternal care and persistent infant crying in the early months,"A sample was selected of 3 groups of infants and their mothers according to how much the babies cried at 6 wks of age, the peak age for infant crying. The three groups of 55 moderate, 38 evening, and 67 persistent criers and their mothers were assessed by diary, observation and questionnaire measures of mother and infant characteristics and interactions at 6 wks and 5 mo of infant age. At 6 wks, mothers of persistent criers spent more time interacting with and physically stimulating their babies. Below-optimum maternal sensitivity/affection was linked to moderately increased crying in the infants overall. However, most mothers of persistent criers showed optimum sensitivity and affection, while no significant links between maternal sensitivity/affection and infant crying were found in the persistent crying group. By 5 mo, when infant crying declined, the range and size of differences between mothers of persistent criers and other mothers declined. Home observations and a standard play measure failed to show group differences in maternal sensitivity, affection and intrusiveness at this age. Results show that persistent infant crying in the early months often occurs in spite of high quality maternal care.

1880,Helping parents to manage infant crying and sleeping: A review of the evidence and its implications for services,"Infant crying and night waking are common concerns for parents, costly problems for health services and may trigger infant abuse or lead to serious child disturbances. Parents are given contradictory advice on how to manage infant crying and sleeping, indicating the need for evidence-based guidance. This review of recent research draws distinctions between infant crying and sleeping problems, between the problem identified by parents and the infant behaviour underlying the problem, between different types of crying behaviour and their causes, and between the types of cases which present at different ages. It proposes that the two main approaches to parenting advocated by baby-care experts, 'infant-demand' and 'structured' parenting, have different benefits, and costs. Comparative studies have found that infant-demand parenting is associated with low amounts of fussing and crying in the first three months of age, but with night waking which continues beyond three months. Randomised controlled trials have provided evidence that structured parenting leads to more overall fussing and crying during the first three months, but reduced night waking and crying after that. The findings are translated into recommendations for preventing and treating infant crying and sleeping problems, for policy debate, and for further research.

1882,Do pregnancy and childbirth adversities predict infant crying and colic? Findings and recommendations,"Bouts of unexplained crying in 1- to 3-month-old infants are a common problem for parents and health services. One proposed explanation has linked the crying to preceding adversities, such as maternal stress and cigarette smoking during pregnancy and complications during childbirth. In the first part of this review, we argue that studies of these links have methodological shortcomings, and make recommendations about the safeguards needed to overcome these shortcomings. In part two, we present a study that assesses the relations between adversity indices and validated measures of crying in two separate cohorts of infants. Four indices of childbirth adversity predicted infant crying separately and cumulatively in cohort 1, but not in cohort 2. We conclude that there is a need for further research that includes replication and other safeguards. Infant crying is a highly emotional issue for many parents. Before researchers add to their burden by claiming that maternal prenatal anxiety, cigarette smoking, or labour medication, contribute to their baby's crying, we need to be sure of our grounds. ¬© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

1883,Bases for maternal perceptions of infant crying and colic behaviour,"According to the commonest definition, infant colic is distinguished by crying which is 'paroxysmal' - that is, intense and different in type from normal fussing and crying. To test this, maternal reports of the distress type of 67 infants whose fuss/crying usually exceeded three hours a day ('persistent criers') were scrutinised using 24 hour audiorecordings of the infants' distressed vocalisation. 'Moderate criers'(n = 55) and 'evening criers) (n = 38) were also assessed. Most of the distress in all three groups was fussing. In the audiorecordings the persistent criers showed a higher crying: fussing ratio than the moderate criers, but intense crying was rare. A third of the persistent criers were reported by their mothers to have occasional, distinct colic bouts of 'intense, unsoothable crying and other behaviour, perhaps due to stomach or bowel pain.' In the audiorecordings these periods were longer, but not paroxysmal in onset or more intense than the crying of persistent criers not judged to have colic. The audible features of the crying may be less important than its unpredictable, prolonged, hard to soothe, and unexplained nature.","St James-Roberts, I. and Conroy, S. and Wilsher, K.",0,1506

1885,Objective confirmation of crying durations in infants referred for excessive crying,"Parents commonly seek clinicians' help for infant crying that they judge to be excessive. To date there is no independent evidence whether such babies actually cry more than average. To assess this, maternal diary and 24 hour audiotape recordings of the crying periods of 16 infants referred for excessive crying were compared with equivalent measures of a normative sample. The overall amounts of crying measured by the two methods were similar. The referred infants cried substantially more over 24 hours and in the afternoon and evening. The difference approached significance in the morning but was insignificant at night time. Some qualifications to the findings are indicated.","St James-Roberts, I. and Hurry, J. and Bowyer, J.",1,1508
1886,Predicting infant crying from fetal movement data: An exploratory study,"Using a standardised procedure, 20 women who were 37 weeks pregnant logged fetal movements for 1 h in the morning and evening for 3 days. Close agreement between such logs and ultrasound recordings of individual differences in fetal movements have been documented. After birth, the babies' sleeping, waking, feeding and crying behaviour were recorded prospectively in validated behaviour diaries at 1, 6 and 12 weeks of age.The fetal movements showed an evening peak, due to a diurnal variation in strong movements. These strong movements did not predict the babies' crying. Weak fetal movements provided a reliable index of fetal differences and predicted the amounts the babies cried at 1, 6 and 12 weeks of age. The findings suggest that temperament-like dispositions present before babies are born predict how much they are likely to cry.

1889,Use of a behavioural programme in the first 3 months to prevent infant crying and sleeping problems,"Determined which elements of a behavioral program (BP) in preventing infant crying and sleeping problems parents would implement and whether the BP was more effective in reducing infant crying and encouraging night-time sleeping than an educational intervention or the routine services. Mothers and newborns were assigned to the BP (205 Ss), educational intervention (202 Ss), or control (203 Ss) group. Behavior diaries kept before randomization and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 wks of age were used to measure implementation of the interventions and infant behavior. Crying and sleeping problems were followed up at 9 mo of age. The educational intervention did not change parental care behavior. One element of the BP, a focal feed between 10 pm and midnight, was not implemented. A 2nd element, stretching of interfeed intervals after 3 wks of age, was implemented initially, but not maintained at older ages. The 3rd element, which asked parents to emphasize day and night differences in the environment, was carried out by more parents in the behavioral group than in the other groups. This led to an increase of around 10% in the number of babies who slept for 5 or more hrs at night at 12 wks of age. Fewer BP parents sought help for crying and sleeping problems between 3 and 9 mo of age.

1890,"Infant crying and sleeping in London, Copenhagen and when parents adopt a ""proximal"" form of care","OBJECTIVE. Western parents are given conflicting advice about whether to introduce a ""scheduled"" approach to infant care or to follow their infants' demands. Attempts to address this issue using randomized, controlled trials have been unsuccessful. This comparative study collected evidence about methods of parenting and associated infant crying and sleeping in 2 communities with substantially different approaches to infant care (London, United Kingdom, and Copenhagen, Denmark) and in a ""proximal care"" group, where parents planned to hold their infants 80% of the time between 8 AM and 8 PM, breastfeed frequently, and respond rapidly to infant cries. METHODS. Validated behavior diaries were used to measure parental behavior and infant crying and night waking longitudinally at 8 to 14 days, 5 to 6 weeks, and 10 to 14 weeks of age. Feeding and sleeping practices were measured by questionnaire. RESULTS. Proximal care parents held infants for 15 to 16 hours per 24 hours and coslept with them through the night more often than other groups. London parents had 50% less physical contact with their infants than proximal care parents, including less contact when the infants were crying and when awake and settled. London parents also abandoned breastfeeding earlier than other groups. Copenhagen parents fell in between the other groups in measures of contact and care. These differences in caregiving were associated with substantial differences in several aspects of infant crying and settled behavior at night. London infants cried 50% more overall than infants in both other groups at 2 and 5 weeks of age. However, bouts of unsoothable crying occurred in all 3 of the groups, and the groups did not differ in unsoothable bouts or in colicky crying at 5 weeks of age. Proximal care infants woke and cried at night most often at 12 weeks. Compared with proximal care infants, Copenhagen infants cried as little per 24 hours, but woke and cried at night less often at 12 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS. ""Infant-demand"" care and conventional Western care, as practiced by London parents, are associated with different benefits and costs. As used by proximal care and Copenhagen parents, infant demand parenting is associated with less overall crying per 24 hours. However, the proximal form of infant-demand parenting is associated with more frequent night waking and crying at 12 weeks of age. Copenhagen infants cry as little per 24 hours as proximal care infants but are settled at night like London infants at 12 weeks of age. Colicky crying bouts at 5 weeks of age are unaffected by care. The findings have implications for public health care policy. First, they add to evidence that bouts of unsoothable crying, which are common in early infancy, are not much affected by variations in parenting, providing reassurance that this aspect of infant crying is not parents' fault. Second, the findings provide information that professionals can give to parents to help them to make choices about infant care. Third, the findings support some experts' concerns that many English parents are adopting methods of care that lead to increased crying in their infants. There is a need for informed debate among professionals, policy makers, and parents about the social and cultural bases for the marked differences between London and Copenhagen parents' approach to care.

At the 3 different ages, 126, 94, and 69 London mothers, respectively, completed questionnaires, and 100, 100, and 99 Manali mothers, respectively, were interviewed. Compared with London mothers, Manali mothers were less inclined to leave their babies to cry, took them into their own beds more often, were more likely to be breast-feeding, and breast-fed their babies to an older age. Both Manali and London mothers reported their babies to have an evening crying peak, most pronounced at 6 wks, during this age range. Although maternal reports suggested lower incidence of crying in the Manali infants, audiorecordings failed to produce convergent evidence.

Substantial negative correlations between amounts of fuss/crying and sleeping, but few associations between fuss/crying and waking or feeding, were found. The persistent criers slept an average of 77 min per 24 h less than the moderate criers. The dearest group differences were in the daytime and all three groups showed evidence of a diurnal organisation in their behaviour.

1894,Supplementary carrying compared with advice to increase responsive parenting as interventions to prevent persistent infant crying,"Objective. To compare two interventions (supplementary carrying, increased parental responsiveness) introduced from birth for their effectiveness in reducing the amounts of crying in general community infants at 2, 6, and 12 weeks age. Design and participants. Mothers and infants in newborn wards of maternity hospitals were assigned to carrying intervention, responsiveness intervention, or control groups. Follow-up measures were used to confirm that the interventions were implemented and to determine their effects on infant crying. Setting and measurements. Diary measurements completed in the home were employed to measure the aspects of parental behavior targeted by the interventions. Audio recordings, diaries, and questionnaires assessed the amounts the infants cried and the impact of the crying on their mothers and the health services. Sample sizes at 6 weeks of age were 59 (carrying intervention), 57 (responsiveness intervention), and 94 infants (control group). Results. The carrying intervention successfully increased the amounts the infants were carried, particularly while settled, to the target levels. The responsiveness intervention led to more limited increases in carrying and to a modest increase in feeding frequency, but did not affect measures of parental interactiveness and play. No differences in amounts of crying and fussing were found between the three groups of infants on any of the measures. Subsidiary analyses confirmed that the dependent variable (infant fuss/crying) and main independent variable (carrying while settled) were not significantly correlated. Conclusions. It is not, at present, possible to recommend either supplementery carrying or increased parental responsiveness as primary, preventative interventions to reduce infant crying.","St. James-Roberts, I. and Hurry, J. and Bowyer, J. and Barr, R.

The two types of problems have been linked together and attributed to a general disturbance of infant regulation. Yet the infant behaviours involved present differently, at separate ages and times of day. To clarify causation, this study aims to assess whether prolonged crying at 5-6 weeks (the peak age for crying) predicts which infants are unsettled in the night at 12 weeks of age (when most infants become settled at night).

Multilevel analysis was used to enable the proportion of the variance in each behavior due to individual differences to be compared due to age changes and day-to-day fluctuations. Findings show that amounts of waking and feeding were mainly accounted for by development with no enduring individual differences found. For sleeping, development and individual differences each contributed to a quarter of the variance, and the amounts infants slept remained stable from 6 wks to 9 mos. Crying decreased linearly with age, with development accounting for 38% and individual difference 15% of the variance. Fussing was more stable than crying, and high-fussers at 6 wks were likely to retain this characteristic at 9 mos, whereas crying at 3 mos did not predict 9 mo behavior.

Findings: four general themes of women's expectations about motherhood were identified, concerning expectations of motherhood, parenting self-confidence, beliefs about the mother-infant dyad and anticipated social support. Findings suggest that there was a substantial discrepancy between expectations and the reality of motherhood, for primiparae and multipara mothers. Unrealistic expectations about motherhood were related to a more difficult postnatal adjustment, lowered self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy. Key conclusions and implications for practice: the way in which women view themselves as mothers during pregnancy can have a significant impact on their emotional well-being following birth. The implications of these findings are discussed with particular reference to promoting a successful adjustment to motherhood through appropriate antenatal care, focussing on maternal expectations about their new role. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Staneva, A. and Wittkowski, A.",0,1518
1898,"The effect of postnatal depression on mother-infant interaction, infant response to the Still-face perturbation, and performance on an Instrumental Learning task","A representative community sample of primiparous depressed women and a nondepressed control group were assessed while in interaction with their infants at 2 months postpartum. At 3 months, infants were assessed on the Still-face perturbation of face to face interaction, and a subsample completed an Instrumental Learning paradigm. Compared to nondepressed women, depressed mothers' interactions were both less contingent and less affectively attuned to infant behavior. Postnatal depression did not adversely affect the infant's performance in either the Still-face perturbation or the Instrumental Learning assessment. Maternal responsiveness in interactions at 2 months predicted the infant's performance in the Instrumental Learning assessment but not in the Still-face perturbation. The implications of these findings for theories of infant cognitive and emotional development are discussed.

1900,Temporal patterning of cry and non-cry sounds in the first eight months of life,"Examined the cry and non-cry vocalizations produced by 2 normal female infants in the reflexive, pleasure voicing, and/or expansion periods of vocal development (1‚Äì33 wks of age) and compared them with respect to different aspects of temporal patterning. Overall series duration and number of breath groups per series were significantly greater for cry than later emerging non-cry vocalizations. The temporal structure of non-cry resembled that of cry in many respects. The subtle differences in temporal patterning may relate to physiological stress factors present only in cry. Data suggest a partial reorganization of vocalization at the onset of pleasure voicing, possibly reflecting the maturation of higher level central nervous system (CNS) nuclei.

1902,Virtual objects that look real: A study of young infants' expectations of tangibility,"32 infants (aged 3, 5, 7, and 9 mo) were presented with real and virtual objects to determine if they had the expectation of tangibility for seen objects. Highly realistic virtual objects were created by using 2 optical quality parabolic mirrors. Familiar virtual objects produced more emotional upset than unfamiliar ones, but did not differ on other measures. It is concluded that most infants as early as 5 mo are sensitive to the lack of tactual feedback from virtual objects as indicated by their attentional patterns, emotional reactions, and manual exploratory behaviors. The authors contend that this is far earlier than reported in the current literature (e.g., T. G. Bower et al, 1970).

1903,Nurse decision making regarding the use of analgesics and sedatives in the pediatric cardiac ICU,"OBJECTIVE: To describe nurse decision making and patient responses associated with the administration of analgesics and sedatives in the pediatric cardiac ICU. DESIGN: Prospective nonexperimental mixed methods study of pediatric cardiac ICU nursing practice. SETTING: Three tertiary academic pediatric heart centers in the United States. SUBJECTS: Pediatric cardiac ICU nurses caring for 217 patients completed 1,330 surveys. INTERVENTIONS: Four-item open-ended nurse survey completed each time an as needed dose of an analgesic or sedative was administered, an analgesic or sedative infusion/dose was titrated, and/or a new analgesic or sedative was administered. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Responses to survey questions were entered verbatim and then collapsed using a consensus process. Collapsing of the data continued until there was a working set of ""symptoms,"" ""changes,"" and ""clinical situation managed"" categories. Nurses identified 28 symptoms managed with analgesia and sedation. The most frequent symptoms included hypertension, tachycardia, crying, pain, and agitation. Nurses identified 20 patient changes that resulted from their interventions. The most prevalent changes included improved hemodynamics, calm state, sleep, comfort, and relaxed state. Nurses identified 22 clinical situations that they were attempting to manage. The most frequent clinical situations included pain, hemodynamics, procedures, hypertension, and agitation. Nurses responded that 22% of their interventions were influenced by others. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric cardiac ICU nurses use many nonspecific indicators to describe patient level of comfort collectively. Decisions for managing patient comfort were influenced by their patients' overall hemodynamic stability.","Staveski, S. L. and Lincoln, P. A. and Fineman, L. D. and Asaro, L.

1905,Diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux in pediatrics,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) may be normal, functional, or pathogenic. Normal GER is of short duration and seen in all individuals. Functional GER, or effortless regurgitation, is common during infancy, causing no ill effects. Pathogenic GER causes diseases such as failure-to-thrive, coughing, choking, aspiration, apnea and/or bradycardia, esophagitis with irritability and excessive crying. Clinically it becomes imperative to distinguish normal and functional from pathogenic GER. The tests presently employed to detect GER are roentgenogram of the upper gastrointestinal tract (showing barium GER), scintigraphy of the esophagus after ingestion of a 99mTc labeled meal (indicating meal GER) and prolonged pH probe monitoring the lower esophagus (depicting acid GER). There seems to be a controversy regarding the usefulness of these tests for the diagnosis of pathogenic GER. In the present study of 89 infants and children presenting with signs and symptoms of pathogenic GER, 70% had significant acid GER, while 36% and 17% had barium and meal GER respectively. No statistically significant correlations were detected between acid GER, barium GER, and meal GER. We conclude that these three tests probably represent different phenomena, and that prolonged esophageal pH monitoring should be considered the most reliable and gold standard for detection of pathogenic GER.","Stephen, T.

1907,Reflex anoxic seizures ('white breath-holding'): nonepileptic vagal attacks,"From clinical history 58 children were diagnosed as having reflex anoxic seizures secondary to provoked cardioinhibition (also known as white breath-holding attacks). Before referral, these seizures were commonly misdiagnosed as epileptic either because the provocation was ignored, not recognised, or was a febrile illness, or because there was no crying, no obvious breath-holding, little cyanosis, and often no pallor to suggest syncope and cerebral ischaemia. The duration of cardiac asystole after ocular compression was measured in these children and in 60 additional children with other paroxysmal disorders. In 45 (78%) of the 58 with reflex anoxic seizures asystole was 2 seconds or over, and in 32 (55%) it was 4 seconds or greater, an abnormal response. Review of the literature supports the concept that these seizures result from vagal-mediated reflex cardiac arrest which can if necessary be prevented by atropine. The simple name 'vagal attack' is proposed. Ocular compression under EEG and ECG control supports the clinical diagnosis if asystole and/or an anoxic seizure is induced","Stephenson, J. B.",0,1525

Furthermore, reported negative sequelae are disturbed parent-infant interaction, increased susceptibility to abdominal pain, and even child abuse. Its etiology remains unknown, leading to a wide variety in interventions. We hypothesize that definitions and outcome measures in studies on IC will be heterogeneous as well. Our objective is to systematically assess how definitions and outcome measures are reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IC. METHODS: CENTRAL, Embase, and MEDLINE/PubMed were searched from inception to December 2012. English-language systematic reviews (SRs) and RCTs concerning IC in children ages 0 to 9 months were included. Bibliographies of included SRs were searched for additional articles.

1910,Prevalence of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in European Infants and Toddlers,"Objective: To assess the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in young children in a cross-sectional, multicenter study in Belgium, Italy, and The Netherlands. Study design: Children were enrolled if they were age 0-48 months, attending a general pediatrician (Belgium, Italy) or a well-baby clinic (The Netherlands) for routine follow-up. Separate questionnaires were developed for infants age 0-12 months and for toddlers age 13-48 months. Questionnaires evaluated the clinical history, symptoms, sociodemographic information on the family, and exposure to stressful life events. FGIDs were defined according to Rome IV criteria. Results: In total 2751 children were included: 1698 infants age 0-12 months and 1053 children age 13-48 months. The prevalence of any FGID in infants age 0-12 months and 13-48 months was 24.7% and 11.3%, respectively. The most common disorders were infant regurgitation (13.8%) in infants and functional constipation (9.6%) in toddlers. Multivariable regression analyses demonstrated that younger age (P = .030) and formula feeding (P = .045) were associated with the prevalence of any FGID among infants. Country (Italy) (P = .033) and parents subjected to domestic violence (P = .035) were associated with the prevalence of any FGID in toddlers age 13-48 months. Conclusions: FGIDs are common in a community sample of Western European infants and toddlers. Regurgitation is most prevalent in infants and functional constipation is most common in toddlers. Younger age, formula feeding, and domestic violence to parents are associated with the prevalence of FGIDs. ¬© 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Steutel, N.

1911,Determining the structure of acute pain responses in vulnerable neonates,"The primary purpose was to determine the underlying structure of the vulnerable infant's response to an acute painful procedure. The secondary purpose was to explore the influence of context (e.g., risk for neurological impairment [NI] and gestational age [GA]). A descriptive cohort design determined contributions of selected indicators to the structure of infant pain. The magnitude of variance for 19 pain indicators was assessed using 3 exploratory factor analyses in 149 neonates. The basic exploratory factor structure included behavioural (e.g., facial actions) and physiological (e.g., oxygen saturation, heart rate) indicators. Facial actions accounted for the greatest variance across all factor solutions (29-39%). Physiological indicators explained 8 to 26% additional variance. There were no consistent differences in the factor structures when contextual factors were explored.","Stevens, B. and Franck, L. and Gibbins, S. and McGrath, P.

1913,Monitoring adverse drug reactions in children using community pharmacies: a pilot study,"AIMS: To determine the feasibility of a community pharmacy-based parental adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting system for children. DESIGN: Prospective study of parent-reported ADRs using a questionnaire issued to the parent or guardians of children 0-11 years of age collecting prescribed medicine for amoxicillin, and/or salbutamol, and collecting prescribed medicine for, or purchasing, paracetamol or ibuprofen suspension. SETTING: Seven community pharmacies in Grampian, Scotland. RESULTS: During a 4-week period 360 prescriptions or purchases for the study medications occurred. Two hundred and sixty-seven parents (85.5%) agreed to participate in the study. One hundred and six participants (40%) returned a total of 122 questionnaires. The demographics of responders and nonresponders including medication, age of child, and social status as assessed by the Depcat score were similar. There was no evidence of under-representation of any socio-economic group. Possible adverse events were detected using a symptom tick list and perceived ADRs using free text entry. Using the symptom tick list approach the most commonly reported symptoms were diarrhoea (28.9%) and tiredness (31.6%) for amoxicillin. The levels of diarrhoea and tiredness reported for ibuprofen, paracetamol and salbutamol were 15% and 20%, 7.4% and 18.5%, and 20% and 0%, respectively. Using the freehand section of the questionnaire 15 specific ADRs were reported by parents (12.3%). Eight children (21.2%) reported ADRs attributed to amoxicilin [diarrhoea (n = 4), fever (n = 1), anorexia (n = 1), hyperactivity (n = 1) and nonspecific (n = 1)], five to paracetamol [diarrhoea (n = 3), anorexia, irritability, crying and very angry (n = 1) and not stated (n = 1)], two to ibuprofen [diarrhoea (n = 1), not stated (n = )]. Only one off-label prescription was identified and this was for salbutamol syrup prescribed to a child under 2 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The prospective monitoring of paediatric ADRs, using a questionnaire issued to parents or guardians in the community pharmacies, is feasible.","Stewart, D. and Helms, P. and McCaig, D. and Bond, C. and McLay, J.",0,1530
1915,Shaken baby syndrome and a triple-dose strategy for its prevention,"OBJECTIVES: Inflicted traumatic brain injury associated with Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS) is a leading cause of injury mortality and morbidity in infants. A triple-dose SBS prevention program was implemented with the aim to reduce the incidence of SBS. The objectives of this study were to describe the epidemiology of SBS, the triple-dose prevention program, and its evaluation. METHODS: Descriptive and spatial epidemiologic profiles of SBS cases treated at Children's Hospital, London Health Sciences Centre, from 1991 to 2010 were created. Dose 1 (in-hospital education): pre-post impact evaluation of registered nurse training, with a questionnaire developed to assess parents' satisfaction with the program. Dose 2 (public health home visits): process evaluation of additional education given to new parents. Dose 3 (media campaign): a questionnaire developed to rate the importance of factors on a 7-point Likert scale. These factors were used to create weights for statistical modeling and mapping within a geographic information system to target prevention ads. RESULTS: Forty-three percent of severe infant injuries were intentional. A total of 54 SBS cases were identified. The mean age was 6.7 months (standard deviation, 10.9 months), with 61% of infant males. The mean Injury Severity Score was 26.3 (standard deviation, 5.5) with a 19% mortality rate. Registered nurses learned new information on crying patterns and SBS, with a 47% increase in knowledge posttraining (p < 0.001). Over 10,000 parents were educated in-hospital, a 93% education compliance rate. Nearly all parents (93%) rated the program as useful, citing ""what to do when the crying becomes frustrating"" as the most important message. Only 6% of families needed to be educated during home visits. Locations of families with a new baby, high population density, and percentage of lone parents were found to be the most important factors for selecting media sites. The spatial analysis revealed six areas needed to be targeted for ad locations. CONCLUSIONS: SBS is a devastating intentional injury that often results in poor outcomes for the child. Implementing a triple-dose prevention program that provides education on crying patterns, coping strategies, and the dangers of shaking is key to SBS prevention. The program increased knowledge. Parents rated the program as useful. The media campaign allowed us to extend the primary prevention beyond new parents to help create a cultural change in the way crying, the primary trigger for SBS, is viewed. Targeting our intervention increased the likelihood that our message was reaching the population in greatest need.","Stewart, T. C. and Polgar, D. and Gilliland, J. and Tanner, D. A. and Girotti, M.

An exploratory study,"The aim of the present study was to explore the parent feeding practice of using food to soothe infant/toddler distress and its relationship to child weight status. Seventy eight families with infants and toddlers (43 males) ranging in age from 3 to 34 months (M = 14 mos, SD = 9 mos) completed a survey which included questions on their use of food to soothe, questionnaires on parent feeding practices, parenting self-efficacy, child temperament and child's weight and length at the time of their last well-baby visit. Results revealed the use of food to soothe to be a valid construct. In addition, mothers who used food to soothe rated themselves lower in parenting self-efficacy and their children higher in temperamental negativity. Analyses examining weight status as the outcome variable revealed that mothers who reported the use of food to soothe had heavier children, however, this relationship was stronger for children rated as high in temperamental negativity. ¬© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Stifter, C.

Colic was identified prospectively through telephone contacts with mothers. Questionnaires on self-efficacy and separation anxiety were completed when infants were 5 months of age. At 18 months of age mothers and infants (colic and non-colic) participated in a laboratory situation to measure attachment. Results revealed that mothers of colic infants reported feeling less competent as mothers. In addition, while mothers of colicky infants tended to have more separation anxiety than mothers of non-colic infants, they felt that these separations did not have a negative effect on their child. Finally, no differences were revealed for attachment classifications between colic and non-colic infants at 18 months.

Colicky infants were drawn from a longitudinal study of 100 infants. While in the hospital, Ss were administered 2 procedures that elicited negative reactivity. To verify the colic and to document behaviors observed during a colic cry bout and a noncolic cry bout, mothers of the colicky Ss and mothers of a matched comparison group kept a diary between 6 and 8 wks. At 5 and 10 mo all infants and mothers, including the colicky and control Ss, participated in laboratory procedures. Mothers also completed an infant temperament questionnaire. Results indicate that colic bouts were longer, intense, and difficult to soothe. By 5 and 10 mo, the colicky Ss and controls demonstrated similar behavior. Results suggest that infant colic is a transient condition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)","Stifter, Cynthia A. and Braungart, Julia",0,1534

Methods Mothers of children aged between 4 months and 4 years were recruited from the emergency department of a children's hospital between March 2012 and June 2015 and interviewed about ACEs, mothers‚Äô depressive symptoms and health status, and children's developmental risk (screened via Parents‚Äô Evaluations of Developmental Status [PEDS]). Between August and November 2016 a Cochran‚ÄìArmitage test assessed trend of PEDS by ACEs. Multinomial regression models examined differences in PEDS by ACEs severity. Mediation by mothers‚Äô depressive symptoms and self-rated health was also assessed. Results Of 1,293 mothers, 56.7% reported one or more ACEs. Mothers also reported developmental risk (20.4% overall): 120 (9.2%) reported one concern and 144 (11.2%) reported two or more concerns on the PEDS. Mothers who reported household substance use, mental illness, or an incarcerated household member during childhood were more likely to report at least one child developmental concern on the PEDS. After controlling for covariates, odds of one PEDS concern were 1.86 (95% CI=1.16, 3.00) for ACEs, one to three versus none, and 2.21 (95% CI=1.26, 3.87) for ACEs four or more versus none. Adjusted odds of two or more concerns were 1.70 (95% CI=1.07, 2.72) for ACEs, one to three versus none, and 1.76 (95% CI=1.02, 3.05) for ACEs, four or more versus none. Mothers‚Äô depressive symptoms and self-rated health were potential mediators. Conclusions Mothers‚Äô ACEs are significantly associated with their children's developmental risk. If replicated, findings suggest that addressing intergenerational trauma through focus on childhood adversity among young children's caregivers may promote child development. ¬© 2017 American Journal of Preventive Medicine","Sun, J. and Patel, F. and Rose-Jacobs, R. and Frank, D.

1936,Acute toxicity of proton beam radiation for pediatric central nervous system malignancies,"Background: Proton beam therapy (PBT) for pediatric CNS malignancies may reduce late toxicity, but acute toxicity is not well defined. We examined acute toxicity for children with CNS malignancies treated with PBT. Procedure: We conducted a retrospective review of 48 children with malignant brain tumors treated with PBT at our facility from 2010 to 2012. For each patient, we recorded age at diagnosis, tumor location, histologic subtype, radiation dose, extent of radiation, and use of concurrent chemotherapy. Acute toxicity scores were recorded per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 at weekly on treatment visits. Maximum grade of fatigue, headache, insomnia, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, alopecia, and dermatitis over the radiation therapy treatment course were recorded, and rates of acute toxicity were calculated. Results: The cohort consisted of 16 glial tumors, 9 medulloblastomas, 6 germinomas, 5 ependymomas, 4 craniopharyngiomas, 3 atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors, and 5 other CNS tumors. The mean age was 10.8 years, and median dose was 5,400cGy (RBE). Acute toxicities were generally low-grade and manageable. The most commonly observed acute toxicities were fatigue, alopecia, and dermatitis. The least common were insomnia and vomiting. Higher maximum grades for headache, nausea, and vomiting over the treatment course were associated with infratentorial location, while higher maximum grades for anorexia, nausea, and alopecia were associated with craniospinal radiation. Conclusions: PBT appears to be well tolerated in pediatric patients with CNS malignancies. Acute toxicity can be managed with supportive care. ¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Suneja, G. and Poorvu, P. D. and Hill-Kayser, C. and Lustig, R. A.",0,1543
1937,Infantile colic,"Infantile colic is a common, self-resolving condition. It has important adverse associations including maternal depression, child abuse and early cessation of breastfeeding. There are many proposed causes of colic, however none is definitive. Colic is likely to be an exacerbation of normal infant crying brought about by physiological and psychosocial factors. There is no known single effective treatment for colic. The mainstay of management is exclusion of organic causes, explanation of the natural history of colic, parental support, offering strategies to deal with the infant‚Äôs feeding and sleep, and exploration of settling techniques. The probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 may be trialled for exclusively breastfed infants with colic. Its efficacy in formula-fed babies is unknown.

1938,Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 for managing infant colic: Protocol for an individual participant data meta-analysis,"Introduction: Infant colic, or excessive crying of unknown cause in infants less than 3 months old, is common and burdensome. Its aetiology is undetermined, and consensus on its management is still lacking. Recent studies suggest a possible link between infant colic and gut microbiota, indicating probiotics to be a promising treatment. However, only a few strains have been tested, and results from randomised controlled trials are conflicting. It is important to clarify whether probiotics are effective for treating infant colic in general, and to identify whether certain subgroups of infants with colic would benefit from particular strains of probiotics. Methods and analysis: Through an individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA), we aim to identify whether the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 is effective in the management of infant colic, and to clarify whether its effects differ according to feeding method (breast vs formula vs combined), proton pump inhibitor exposure, and antibiotic exposure. The primary outcomes are infant crying duration and treatment success (at least 50% reduction in crying time from baseline) at 21 days postintervention. Individual participant data from all studies will be modelled simultaneously in multilevel generalised linear mixed-effects regression models to account for the nesting of participants within studies. Subgroup analyses of participant-level and intervention-level characteristics will be undertaken on the primary outcomes to assess if the intervention effect differs between certain groups of infants.

1941,"Early exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, breastfeeding and asthma at age six","Our aims were to assess association of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) with childhood asthma measured up to age 6 and the effect of DDE on the protective effect of breastfeeding on asthma. In addition, we attempted to assess the relevant time-window of DDE exposure (i.e. at birth or at 4 years). All women presenting for antenatal care in Menorca, Spain over a 12-month period beginning in mid-1997 were invited to take part in a longitudinal study that included a yearly visit. Four hundred eighty-two children were enrolled and 462 provided complete outcome data after 6.5 years of follow-up. Organochlorine compounds were measured in cord serum of 402 (83%) infants and in blood samples of 285 children aged 4. We defined asthma as the presence of wheezing at age 6 and during any preceding year or doctor-diagnosed asthma, and used skin prick test at age 6 to determine atopic status. Results: At birth and 4 years of age, all children had detectable levels of DDE (median 1 ng/ mL and 0.8 ng/ mL, respectively). From birth to age 4, the mean DDE level among children with artificial feeding decreased by 72%, while among breastfed children it increased by 53%. Diagnosed asthma and persistent wheezing were associated with DDE at birth [odds ratio (OR) for an increase in 1 ng/ mL, OR=1.18, 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.01-1.39 and OR=1.13, 95% CI=0.98-1.30, respectively], but not with DDE at 4 years. Neither breastfeeding nor atopy modified these associations (P>0.3). Breastfeeding protected against diagnosed asthma (OR=0.33, 95% CI=0.08-0.87) and wheezing (OR=0.53, 95% CI=0.34-0.82) in children with low and high DDE levels at birth. Conclusion: In a community without known dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane environmental releases, this study strengthens the evidence for an effect of DDE on asthma by measuring the disease at age 6 and does not support the hypothesis that DDE modifies the protective effect of breastfeeding on asthma. ¬© 2006 The Authors.","Sunyer, J. and Torrent, M. and Garcia-Esteban, R. and Ribas-Fit√≥, N. and Carrizo, D. and Romieu, I. and Ant√≥, J.

1948,The role of infant appetite in extended formula feeding,"Objective Parental decision-making around extended formula feeding (12 months+) has not been explored previously. This study tested the hypotheses that extended formula milk use (i) is associated with poorer appetite and (ii) supplements lower food intake. Methods Appetite was assessed with the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ) in 3854 twin children aged 16 months. Diet was assessed from 3-day diaries in 2714 children at 21 months. Parents reported their children's weight at 24 months. Associations between formula feeding and (1) appetite, (2) energy intake and (3) weight were examined. 35 mothers were interviewed when the children were 7 years old to explore retrospectively their reasons for extended formula feeding. Results Formula consumers (13% of the sample) scored significantly differently than non-formula consumers on five of the six CEBQ subscales, indicating lower appetite avidity: 'food responsiveness' (2.02 vs 2.22, respectively),'enjoyment of food' (3.99 vs 4.20), 'satiety responsiveness' (2.89 vs 2.65), 'slowness in eating' (2.63 vs 2.46) and 'food fussiness' (2.34 vs 2.14).

1950,Age at First Birth and Psychiatric Disorders in Low-Income Pregnant Women,"Background: Young maternal age at first birth has been associated with poor mental health. However, few studies directly compared the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among adolescent versus adult mothers at first birth using a comprehensive diagnostic tool. This study examined the association between age at first birth and 22 current and lifetime psychiatric disorders in a cohort of low-income pregnant women. Methods: The sample consisted of 744 low-income currently pregnant women who were Medicaid-eligible and enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in Saint Louis City and 5 rural counties in Southeastern Missouri. Current (previous 12 months) and lifetime psychiatric disorders were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule IV (DIS-IV). Logistic regression analyses tested the association between women's age at first birth and psychiatric disorders, controlling for potential confounders, including relative poverty. Results: When adjusting for confounders, mothers giving birth in their teens had 2.5 times the odds of having a lifetime behavior disorder (odds ratio [OR] 2.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-5.24) and current posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.38-4.70) and almost twice the odds of having at least one anxiety disorder compared to older women at first birth (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.10-2.85). Conclusion: Low-income women who have their first birth in adolescence have higher odds of psychiatric disorders and should be the target of psychiatric screening during their pregnancy. Mothers beginning childbearing before age 19 should be screened during pregnancy for anxiety disorders, including PTSD, and behavior disorders. ¬© Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Tabet, M. and Flick, L.

1952,Effect of neonatal circumcision on pain response during subsequent routine vaccination,"BACKGROUND: Preliminary studies suggested that pain experienced by infants in the neonatal period may have long-lasting effects on future infant behaviour. The objectives of this study were to find out whether neonatal circumcision altered pain response at 4-month or 6-month vaccination compared with the response in uncircumcised infants, and whether pretreatment of circumcision pain with lidocaine-prilocaine cream (Emla) affects the subsequent vaccination response. METHODS: We used a prospective cohort design to study 87 infants. The infants formed three groups--uncircumcised infants, and infants who had been randomly assigned Emla or placebo in a previous clinical trial to assess the efficacy of Emla cream as pretreatment for pain in neonatal circumcision. Infants were videotaped during vaccination done at the primary care physician's clinic. Videotapes were scored without knowledge of circumcision or treatment status by a research assistant who had been trained to measure infant facial action, cry duration, and visual analogue scale pain scores. FINDINGS: Birth characteristics and infant characteristics at the time of vaccination, including age and temperament scores, did not differ significantly among groups. Multivariate ANOVA revealed a significant group effect (p < 0.001) in difference (vaccination minus baseline) values for percentage facial action, percentage cry time, and visual analogue scale pain scores. Univariate ANOVAs were significant for all outcome measures (p < 0.05): infants circumcised with placebo had higher difference scores than uncircumcised infants for percentage facial action (136.9 vs 77.5%), percentage cry duration (53.8 vs 24.7%), and visual analogue scale pain scores (5.1 vs 3.1 cm). There was a significant linear trend on all outcome measures, showing increasing pain scores from uncircumcised infants, to those circumcised with Emla, to those circumcised with placebo. INTERPRETATION: Circumcised infants showed a stronger pain response to subsequent routine vaccination than uncircumcised infants. Among the circumcised group, preoperative treatment with Emla attenuated the pain response to vaccination. We recommend treatment to prevent neonatal circumcision pain.","Taddio, A. and Katz, J. and Ilersich, A. L. and Koren, G.",0,1555

1954,Combined analgesia and local anesthesia to minimize pain during circumcision,"BACKGROUND: Pain of circumcision is only partially relieved by single modalities, such as penile nerve block, lidocaine-prilocaine cream, and sucrose pacifiers. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of a combination of interventions on the pain response of infants undergoing circumcision. METHODS: Cohort study. Group 1 included infants circumcised using the Mogen clamp and combined analgesics (lidocaine dorsal penile nerve block, lidocaine-prilocaine, acetaminophen, and sugar-coated gauze dipped in grape juice). Group 2 included infants circumcised using the Gomco clamp and lidocaine-prilocaine. Infants were videotaped during circumcision, and pain was assessed using facial activity scores and percentage of time spent crying. RESULTS: There were 57 infants in group 1 and 29 infants in group 2. Birth characteristics did not differ between groups. Infants in group 1 were older than infants in group 2 (17 days vs 2 days) (P < .001). The mean duration of the procedure was 55 seconds and 577 seconds for infants in group 1 and 2, respectively (P < .001). Facial action scores and percentage of time spent crying were significantly lower during circumcision for infants in group 1 (P < .001). The percentage of time spent crying was 18% and 40% for infants in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

1958,Clinical presentation of primary congenital hypothyroidism: experience before mass screening,"Primary congenital hypothyroidism is a common preventable cause of mental retardation. Neonatal thyroid screening is highly successful in early diagnosis and the improvement of developmental prognosis in the hypothyroid neonate. However, rarely cases could be missed, so doctors must be aware of the earl symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to emphasize the presenting clinical features of primary congenital hypothyroidism at the age of diagnosis. The study population included 17 children with primary congenital hypothyroidism who attended the Department of Pediatrics, University Clinical Center Tuzla between 1986 and 1999. The diagnosis of all patients was confirmed by serum thyroid function tests (T4 and TSH). Of the 17 patients 10 (58.8%) were diagnosed in the first three months of life and 3 of them (17.6%) between fourth and sixth month of life. Four children (23.5%) were diagnosed after the age of six months. In the first three months of life hypothermia, constipation, jaundice, poor feeding, hoarse cry, macroglossia and hypoactivity were the moste common symptoms. Among the 17 patients with primary congenital hypothyroidism 5 of them (29.4 %) were diagnosed to have disgenetic thyroid tissue and 12 (70.6%) as having dyshormonogenesis. TSH and T4 levels were higher in patients in whom thyroid tissue was dysgenetic as comapared with those with dyshormonogenesis but the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Now it is expected that neonatal screening program in Bosnia and Herzegovina Federation will contribute to the detection of primary congenital hypothyroidism in early days of life. However, until an effective screening test is not yet routine in whole country, paediatricians should consider the diagnosis of hypothyroidism whenever it is clinically suggested.","Tahiroviƒá, H. and Toromanoviƒá, A.",0,1560
1959,Forgotten survivors of intimate-partner violence: The role of gender and mothering in infant development,"Although gender and mothering are critical factors in the development of infants exposed to intimate-partner violence (IPV), the majority of research has focused on school-age and adolescent populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the moderating effect of gender in the relationship between mother-infant interaction and infant development in families of IPV. Maternal report was used to measure infants' cognitive and social functioning while mother-infant interaction quality was assessed through an observational measure. Participants consisted of 44 mothers and their infants (4-43 months of age). While male infants showed poorer fine motor, problem-solving, and personal-social skills than did their female counterparts, comparable gross motor and communication skills were demonstrated. Moderator analysis for gender indicated that the association among maternal cognitive growth fostering and gross motor skills was significantly stronger for boys than it was for girls. No other moderator effects were detected. Analysis examining age, gender by age, and infant competencies did not reveal significant effects.

1961,Incidence and risk factors for infantile colic in Iranian infants,"Aim: To assess the incidence of infantile colic and its association with variable predictors in infants born in a community maternity hospital, Tehran, Iran. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, mothers who gave birth to live newborns between February 21 and March 20, 2003 at the hospital were invited to join to the study. For every infant-mother dyad data were collected on infant gender, type of delivery, gestational age at birth, birth weight, birth order, and mother's reproductive history. Then mothers were given a diary to document the duration of crying/ fussiness behaviors of their infants for the next 12 wk. We scheduled home visits at the time the infants were 3 mo of age to collect the completed diaries and obtain additional information on infants' nutritional sources and identify if medications were used for colic relief. Cases of colic were identified by applying Wessel criteria to recorded data. Chi-square and Mann-whitney U tests were used to compare proportions for non-parametric and parametric variables, respectively. Results: From 413 infants, follow-up was completed for 321 infants. In total, 65 infants (20.24%) satisfied the Wessel criteria for infantile colic. No statistical significance was found between colicky and non-colicky infants according to gender, gestational age at birth, birth weight, type of delivery, and, infant's feeding pattern. However, firstborn infants had higher rate for developing colic (P = 0.03). Conclusion: Colic incidence was 20% in this population of Iranian infants. Except for birth order status, no other variable was significantly associated with infantile colic. ¬© 2008 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.","Talachian, E. and Bidari, A. and Rezaie, M.

A case study,"The current study evaluated the impact of food behavior on the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders, food allergies, and overweight, on children. For this purpose, a series of questionnaires regarding diet, eating habits, and the incidence of childhood affections, were completed by the parents of 212 children aged between 0 and 14 years, patients in the St. John Children's Hospital of Galati, Romania. Eating patterns were investigated, including the frequency of eating breakfast, fruits and vegetable intake, fast food, and carbonated drinks consumption. The results showed an increase in the incidence of digestive disorders, by 6.13% for boys and by 4.72% for girls, especially for those who eat daily fast food compared to children who consumed fast food only two to three times a week and respectfully, an increase in the incidence of food allergies by 8.96% for boys and 6.60% for girls in case of daily consumption of carbonated drinks compared to children who consumed this type of beverages only once a week or less. In the case of overweight children, the results also displayed a low-frequency consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, by 5.19% for boys and 4.71% for girls, less than two times a week, compared with the daily consumption of these products. ¬© Mattioli 1885.","Talaghir, L.

1963,Early brain abnormalities in infants born very preterm predict under-reactive temperament,"Background: Early temperament may mediate the association between brain abnormalities following preterm birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Aims: This exploratory study investigated whether brain abnormalities in infants born very preterm predicted temperament. Study design: Infants born prematurely underwent structural MRI at term. Mother self-reported depression symptoms at the scanning visit, and the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised-Short (IBQ-R-S) about their infant at 3-months corrected age. Subjects: Infants (n = 214) born at ‚â§32 weeks gestation (M = 29.29, SD = 2.60). Average post-menstrual age at the MRI scan was 42.72 weeks (SD = 1.30). The majority of the infants were male (n = 115), and Caucasian (n = 145) or African American (n = 58). The average birthweight in grams was 1289.75 (SD = 448.5). Outcome measures: Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised-Short (IBQ-R-S) subscales. Results: Multivariate regression showed white matter abnormalities predicted lower ratings on High Intensity Pleasure and Vocal Reactivity, grey matter abnormalities predicted lower ratings on High Intensity Pleasure and Cuddliness, and cerebellar abnormalities predicted lower ratings on Fear and Sadness IBQ-R-S subscales adjusting for gestational age and sex. The pattern of results was essentially unchanged when maternal depression and socioeconomic status were included in the model. Conclusions: Early MRI-diagnosed brain abnormalities in infants born very preterm were associated less vocalization and engagement during cuddling, decreased ability to take pleasure in stimulating activities, and lower emotionality in fear and sadness domains. Although replication is warranted, an under-reactive temperament in infants born preterm may have a neurobiological basis. ¬© 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Tamm, L. and Patel, M. and Peugh, J. and Kline-Fath, B.

Materials and methods: The respondents consisted of 1001 dentists, pediatric dentistry administrators randomly selected by each prefectural or municipal dental association, and 1031 guardians of preschoolers who attended kindergartens or children's day-care centers. Answers were received from 712 dentists and 844 guardians. We compared answers to question No. 16 for dentists and questions No. 23 & 26 for guardians. Furthermore, we compared free comments to question No. 16 for dentists and answers to No. 27 for guardians. Question No. 27 for dentists and question No. 21 for guardians similarly asked about children's eating problems, and we thus next compared the tendencies noted in answers to these questions. In addition, a componential analysis was conducted for free text answers to question No. 31 for dentists and question No. 34 for guardians to qualitatively examine ‚Äúfree comments to children's eating problems‚Äù. Free comments were statistically analyzed using a text-mining approach in IBM SPSS Text Analytics for Surveys.

1965,Maternal influence on the fetal microbiome in a population-based study of the first-pass meconium,"Background: Meconium is formed before birth and may reflect the microbiome of the fetus. To test our hypothesis, we investigated whether maternal factors during pregnancy, such as biodiversity of the living environment, influence the microbiome of the first stool more than immediate perinatal factors. Methods: We recruited 218 consecutive newborn infants from one hospital. Regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were sequenced to characterize the microbiomes of the first-pass meconium samples (N=212). We used a multivariate model to determine both the prenatal and perinatal factors affecting the microbiome. Results: The number of operational taxonomic units ranged from 0 to 448 per newborn. The most abundant phyla were Firmicutes, with a relative abundance of 44%, Proteobacteria, 28%, and Bacteroidetes, 15%. By a multivariate analysis, the biodiversity of the home environment increased the diversity of microbiomes, whereas perinatal factors, such as the delivery mode or exposure to antimicrobials during labor did not have an effect. Conclusion: The microbiome of the first-pass meconium was not altered by immediate perinatal factors, but was affected by maternal factors during pregnancy, implying the in utero transfer of microbes and the development of the gut microbiota niche in fetal life. ¬© 2018, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.","Tapiainen, T. and Paalanne, N. and Tejesvi, M.

Various results have been reported regarding the management of colic with probiotics in terms of effectiveness, with no side effects or health risks in the infants. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of probiotics on the infants with colic using the quadratic inference functions (QIF). Methods: This single-blind, randomized, clinical trial was conducted on 98 infants admitted to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic of Bu Ali Sina Hospital in Sari, Iran. The neonates were diagnosed with infantile colic by a pediatric gastroenterologist. Patients were randomly divided into two groups (49 subjects per each). In the control group, the infants received placebo, and in the case group, the neonates were administrated with BioGaia probiotic oral drops for 21 days. The QIF method was fitted to analyze the influential factors in the improvement of infantile colic. Results: According to the QIF results in data analysis, mean duration of crying had a significant difference between the infants in the case and control groups (P<0.001). Moreover, time (first, second, and third week) was determined as a leading variable in the improvement of infantile colic (P=0.001). Conclusion: According to the results of longitudinal data analysis, use of probiotics in the evolving gut could reduce infantile colic and improve the quality of life in the studied neonates.","Tatari, M. and Charati, J.

The two groups were similar with regard to sociodemographic and other variables with the exception that mothers of colicky infants were older (P less than .005). Quantitative measurements of crying were obtained using prospective diaries of infant behavior. Colicky infants were found to cry 2.6 +/- 1.1 h/d as compared with 1.0 +/- 0.5 h/d for control infants (P less than .001). The treatment of these infants was based on the assumption that colic results from inappropriate parental responses to the baby's crying and consisted of counseling the parent on more effective responses. This resulted in the infants' crying decreasing from 2.6 +/- 1.1 h/d to 0.8 +/- 0.3 h/d (P less than .001), no different from the average of the control group. It is concluded that a major cause of colic is the misinterpretation of infant cries leading to ineffective responses, and that this can be managed by counseling parents on how to respond to infant crying.","Taubman, B.",1,1570
1970,"Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI.nz) study: A randomised controlled trial of sleep, food and activity interventions for preventing overweight from birth","Background: Rapid weight gain during the first three years of life predicts child and adult obesity, and also later cardiovascular and other morbidities. Cross-sectional studies suggest that infant diet, activity and sleep are linked to excessive weight gain. As intervention for overweight children is difficult, the aim of the Prevention of Overweight in Infancy (POI.nz) study is to evaluate two primary prevention strategies during late pregnancy and early childhood that could be delivered separately or together as part of normal health care. Methods/Design. This four-arm randomised controlled trial is being conducted with 800 families recruited at booking in the only maternity unit in the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. Mothers are randomised during pregnancy to either a usual care group (7 core contacts with a provider of government funded ""Well Child"" care over 2 years) or to one of three intervention groups given education and support in addition to ""Well Child"" care: the Food, Activity and Breastfeeding group which receives 8 extra parent contacts over the first 2 years of life","Taylor, B.

1978,Neonatal withdrawal from maternal volatile substance abuse,"AIM: To determine whether neonates born to mothers who are volatile substance abusers are at risk for an abstinence syndrome. METHODS: A consecutive sample of infants born to volatile substance abusing mothers was studied over four years, in a university affiliated medical centre with a variable mix of primary, secondary, and tertiary care patients. Infants were clinically scored with the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System. Those who fulfilled a priori scoring criteria were treated with phenobarbital and scoring was continued. RESULTS: There were 48 babies of whom 32 fulfilled the criteria for pharmacotherapy. All eight babies with the characteristic odour, and 15 of the 21 born to mothers with that odour, fulfilled these criteria. The typical symptoms were excessive and high pitched cry, sleeplessness, hyperactive Moro reflex, tremor, hypotonia, and poor feeding. Mean age of onset of treatment was 27.1 hours and mean duration was 5.8 days. Treatment was judged effective in 17 of 27, while benefit was borderline in three and absent in seven. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that there is an identifiable neonatal volatile substance abuse abstinence syndrome. The characteristic chemical odour in the neonate or mother is a marker for its occurrence, and phenobarbital treatment seems to be effective. The Finnegan Scoring System seems to be useful for grading its severity.","Tenenbein, M. and Casiro, O. G. and Seshia, M. M. and Debooy, V. D.",0,1579
1979,Infant and toddler sleep in Australia and New Zealand,"Aims: To characterize sleep patterns and sleep problems in a large sample of young children (birth to 36 months) in Australia (AU) and New Zealand (NZ). Methods: Parents and caregivers of 2154 infants and toddlers in AU and NZ completed an expanded version of the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Results: Overall, young children in AU and NZ go to bed relatively early (19:35), awaken on average 1.08 times per night for an average of 23 min, have a low likelihood of bed-sharing with parents (7.2%) and obtain an average of 13.24 h total sleep. However, a significant percentage of parents perceive that their child has a sleep problem (30.69%). Sleep patterns in these children demonstrate clear developmental changes, including a decrease in daytime sleep and total sleep time, as well as consolidation of sleep during the night (decrease in night wakings and nocturnal wakefulness). Parents in AU and NZ are also highly likely to encourage independence and self-soothing, especially after the age of 3 months. Conclusions: These findings provide parents and professionals reference data for assessing sleep in young children, as well as common parenting practices related to sleep behaviours. ¬© 2011 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (Royal Australasian College of Physicians).","Teng, A. and Bartle, A. and Sadeh, A. and Mindell, J.",0,1580
1980,"The impact of maternal characteristics, infant temperament and contextual factors on maternal responsiveness to infant","Postnatal maternal depressive symptoms are consistently associated with impairments in maternal attunement (i.e., maternal responsiveness and bonding). There is a growing body of literature examining the impact of maternal cognitive factors (e.g., rumination) on maternal attunement and mood. However, little research has examined the role of infant temperament and maternal social support in this relationship. This study investigated the hypothesis that rumination would mediate (1) the relationship between depressive symptoms and attunement and (2) the relationship between social support and attunement. We further predicted that infant temperament would moderate these relationships, such that rumination would demonstrate mediating effects on attunement when infant difficult temperament was high, but not low. Two hundred and three mothers completed measures on rumination, depressive symptoms, attunement, perceived social support and infant temperament. Rumination mediated the effect of postnatal maternal depressive mood on maternal self-reported responsiveness to the infant when infants were low, but not high, in negative temperament. When infants had higher negative temperament, there were direct relationships between maternal depressive symptoms, social support and maternal self-reported responsiveness to the infant. This study is limited by its cross-sectional and correlational nature and the use of self-report measures to assess a mother's awareness of her infant needs and behaviours, rather than observational measures of maternal sensitivity. These findings suggest potentially different pathways to poor maternal responsiveness than those expected and provide new evidence about the contexts in which maternal cognitive factors, such as rumination, may impact on the mother-infant relationship. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Tester-Jones, M. and O'Mahen, H. and Watkins, E. and Karl, A.",0,1581
1981,Associations between early maternal sensitivity and children's sleep throughout early childhood,"Despite strong theoretical reasons to believe that the quality of parent‚Äìinfant interactions should influence child sleep, the empirical evidence for links between maternal behavior and children's sleep is equivocal. Notably, it is unclear at which ages such influences might be particularly salient. The current study aimed to examine prospective longitudinal associations between early maternal sensitivity and children's sleep during early childhood. Maternal sensitivity was assessed at 12¬†months during a home visit. Children's sleep was measured at 12 and 18¬†months as well as at 2, 3, and 4¬†years, using a sleep diary completed by mothers. Results revealed significant or marginal positive associations between maternal sensitivity and children's sleep consolidation (percentage of nighttime sleep) at 2, 3, and 4¬†years, but not at the most proximal assessments of 12 and 18¬†months. These findings suggest that child age could potentially be a key factor in the associations between maternal behavior and children's sleep. Highlights: Associations between three dimensions of early maternal sensitivity and children's sleep from 1 to 4¬†years of age were investigated. Maternal sensitivity was positively associated with children's sleep between 2 and 4¬†years, but not at 12 and 18¬†months. The results suggest that child age could be a key factor in the associations between maternal behavior and children's sleep.

1982,Images of black modernism : Verbal and visual strategies of the Harlem Renaissance,"Focusing on the years from 1922 to 1938, this book revisits an important moment in black cultural history to explore how visual elements were used in poems, novels, and photography to undermine existing stereotypes. Miriam Thaggert identifies and analyzes an early form of black American modernism characterized by a heightened level of experimentation with visual and verbal techniques for narrating and representing blackness. The work of the writers and artists under discussion reflects the creative tension between the intangibility of some forms of black expression, such as spirituals, and the materiality of the body evoked by other representations of blackness, such as 'Negro' dialect. By paying special attention to the contributions of photographers and other visual artists who have not been discussed in previous accounts of black modernism, Thaggert expands the scope of our understanding of the Harlem Renaissance and contributes to a growing recognition of the importance of visual culture as a distinct element within, and not separate from, black literary studies. Thaggert trains her critical eye on the work of James Weldon Johnson, Nella Larsen, George Schuyler, Carl Van Vechten, James Van Der Zee, and Aaron Siskind artists who experimented with narrative and photographic techniques in order to alter the perception of black images and to question and reshape how one reads and sees the black body. Examining some of the more problematic authors and artists of black modernism, she challenges entrenched assumptions about black literary and visual representations of the early to mid twentieth century. Thaggert concludes her study with a close look at the ways in which Harlem and the Harlem Renaissance were reimagined and memorialized in two notable texts Wallace Thurman's 1932 satire Infants of the Spring and the Metropolitan Museum of Art's controversial 1969 exhibition 'Harlem on My Mind: The Cultural Capital of Black America, 1900' 1968.

1984,Urinary excretion of catecholamines during the first months after delivery,"Assessed the urinary excretion of free catecholamines in 17 women, postdelivery, after 3 wks, 6 wks, and 6 mo, respectively. Relatively high levels were found both for adrenaline and noradrenaline excretion, on the 1st and 3rd occasions, with significantly lowered levels on the 2nd. There was no reason to believe these changes were caused by changes in life-style or medication. Rather, sympathoadrenal activation is suspected as the cause. Mothers who had had a negative experience of their delivery (according to interview) as well as mothers who felt tired during the mid-phase of the follow-up (according to diaries) had very small variations in catecholamine excretion and did not show increased levels 6 mo after delivery. Whether the mother experienced her infant as crying or not had no significant association with catecholamine output. Partial support was found for low catecholamine excretion for mothers who felt tired during the mid-phase.

1985,Specific relations of dimensional anxiety and manifest anxiety disorders during pregnancy with difficult early infant temperament: a longitudinal cohort study,"Anxiety in the antenatal period is a common experience, associated with adverse consequences for mother and child. Specific types of prenatal anxiety may have unique associations with infant temperament. This study examines the prospective relationships between general prenatal anxiety, fear of childbirth, and specific prenatal anxiety disorders and early infant temperament 8¬†weeks postpartum. Data were derived from the Akershus Birth Cohort (ABC), a longitudinal cohort study which targeted all women scheduled to give birth at Akershus University Hospital, Norway. Psychometric measures pertained to general prenatal anxiety (Hopkins Symptom Checklist), fear of childbirth (Wijma delivery expectancy questionnaire), screening for manifest prenatal anxiety disorders based on questions from the mini-international neuropsychiatric interview, and difficult infant temperament (Infant Characteristics Questionnaire). The sample for the present study included 2206 women. General prenatal anxiety, fear of childbirth, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and specific phobia presented unique significant prospective contributions to difficult infant temperament 8¬†weeks postpartum. Separate hierarchical regression models indicated that general prenatal anxiety and fear of childbirth provided the strongest unique contributions. Considering the burden on mothers and the potential long-term effects on child development, the findings of this study highlight the importance of screening women for different types of prenatal anxiety in routine obstetric care. Clinical awareness of the condition and its consequences is warranted. Due to the complexity of infant temperament as a construct with various influences, future research should consider mechanisms and influential factors pertaining to the relationship between prenatal anxiety and infant temperament. ¬© 2020, The Author(s).","Thiel, F. and Iffland, L. and Drozd, F. and Haga, S.

In this preliminary study within a larger investigation, we used infants with sleep/feeding difficulties as a proxy for later development of SOR. We tested evidence for construct validity and internal reliability of pre-and perinatal factors that, together, could predict infant sleep/feeding difficulties. We obtained retrospective data on 360 mother-infant dyads on 38 pre-and perinatal variables and linked the data with infant referral for sleep/feeding difficulties. We analyzed the data with Rasch analysis to examine evidence for a unidimensional construct. Our results show good evidence for a construct comprising 18 of the 38 pre-and perinatal variables examined. This construct may represent a step toward early identification of SOR and provide therapists with evidence to support the use of pre-and perinatal information as predictors of infant sleep/feeding difficulties. ¬© The Author(s) 2015.","Thomas, S. and Bundy, A.

1992,Iodine Status and Growth in 0-2-Year-Old Infants with Cow's Milk Protein Allergy,"Objectives: The aim of the present article was to investigate iodine status and growth in cow's milk protein allergic infants and to identify potential predictors of iodine status and growth. Methods: Fifty-seven infants under 2 years of age were included in an observational cross-sectional study. Two spot urine samples were collected and analyzed for iodine, together with a 3-day food record and a food frequency questionnaire. Urine iodine concentrations were compared with the WHO cut-off values for iodine deficiency. Measurements of weight, length, and head circumference at birth and study inclusion were converted to standard deviation scores. Subgroup analyses were performed on different feeding patterns, according to weaning status. Results: Median age was 9 months. Median urinary iodine concentration was 159ug/L. One third of the children had urine iodine concentrations indicating iodine deficiency. Infants who were mainly breastfed were at highest risk and 58% were classified as deficient. Dietary factors positively associated with iodine excretion were intake of enriched baby cereals and meeting the dietary requirement for iodine. Stunting was present in 5%. Underweight and wasting was frequent at 11% and this was associated with food refusal and poor appetite, but not with iodine status. Growth failure was detected among boys. Conclusions: The present study suggests that cow's milk protein allergy children have high prevalence of iodine deficiency and poor growth, however the 2 conditions were not associated. The subgroup of mainly breastfed infants was at higher risk of iodine deficiency compared to weaned infants. Subjects with feeding problems had increased risk of malnutrition.

1994,"Developmental origins of obesity: Early feeding environments, infant growth, and the intestinal microbiome","Objectives: Pediatric overweight and obesity are growing problems worldwide, with increasing prevalence among even infants and young children. The refractory nature of early overweight necessitates identifying the factors contributing to early excess weight gain for successful intervention. Early feeding practices may be particularly important in shaping long-term vulnerability to obesity. How and what infants are fed can influence weight gain, adiposity, and energy metabolism during infancy and across the life course through a number of interacting physiological and behavioral pathways. This article argues that these biological mechanisms interact with the social and behavioral context of infant feeding to create differential vulnerability to later obesity. Methods: This article reviews recent research on the potential mechanisms linking infant feeding and risk of later obesity, focusing on the emerging role of microflora colonization. Results: The nutritive and non-nutritive components of breastmilk, formula and solid foods and the practices surrounding feeding shape the infant metabolome, programming growth rates and body composition, altering metabolism and physiology, promoting differential microfloral colonization, and shaping behavioral responses to foods and eating. Conclusion: The occurrence of chronic disease precursors at increasingly younger ages and the tendency of overweight young children to become overweight adolescents and adults underscore the importance of understanding this complex early exposure and intervening early to prevent the development of obesity in increasingly weight-promoting environments. ¬© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Thompson, A.

Young parents and their children may be at risk for negative health outcomes, not directly as a consequence of maternal age but because of poverty and other inequities in the social determinants of health. The health needs of child and mother are best assessed using a nonjudgmental approach, appropriate screening tools and open questions that address both preventative and acute health issues. The dyad's co-existing needs may be anticipated as they relate to growth and development, infant and adolescent mental health, nutrition and food security, safety, relationships, parenting, education, sexual health and the facilitation of supports and resources.

1998,Prevalence and persistence of health problems after childbirth: associations with parity and method of birth,"BACKGROUND: Awareness about the extent of maternal physical and emotional health problems after childbirth is increasing, but few longitudinal studies examining their duration have been published. The aim of this study was to describe changes in the prevalence of maternal health problems in the 6 months after birth and their association with parity and method of birth. METHODS: A population-based, cohort study was conducted in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Australia. The study population, comprising women who gave birth to a live baby from March to October 1997, completed 4 questionnaires on the fourth postpartum day, and at 8, 16, and 24 weeks postpartum. Outcome measures were self-reported health problems during each of the three 8-week postpartum periods up to 24 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 1295 women participated, and 1193 (92) completed the study. Health problems showing resolution between 8 and 24 weeks postpartum were exhaustion/extreme tiredness (60-49), backache (53-45), bowel problems (37-17), lack of sleep/baby crying (30-15), hemorrhoids (30-13), perineal pain (22-4), excessive/prolonged bleeding (20-2), urinary incontinence (19-11), mastitis (15-3), and other urinary problems (5-3). No significant changes occurred in the prevalence of frequent headaches or migraines, sexual problems, or depression over the 6 months.

2001,Disorders of the oesophagus and stomach in infants,"Pathological processes and disease entities in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, specifically those of the oesophagus and the stomach in infancy, have received a disproportionately small amount of attention until recently when appreciation of their pathophysiology and concordant importance in terms of symptomatology has been highlighted. This is probably a phenomenon secondary to improved diagnostic yield from the recent technical advances in areas such as infant endoscopy and a shift in opinion regarding the pathophysiological origin of ubiquitous symptoms of infancy such as feeding disorders, colic and irritability. In addition, the apparently complex interactions of various aetiological factors such as pH-independent gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), cow's milk protein intolerance (CMPI), Helicobacter pylori gastritis and upper GI motor disorders have in the past 1-2 years become underlined in terms of aetiopathogenesis and have radically changed thinking regarding diagnosis and therapy of infants with apparent upper-GI-associated symptoms. The contribution to comprehension of infant upper GI disorders of inflammatory paradigms and ontogeny of the upper GI tract is also a recent area worthy of mention. The recent advances in all of these areas and their contribution to the understanding, and subsequent diagnosis and therapy, of upper GI symptoms and their explanation by way of aetiopathogenesis will be explored in this chapter.","Thomson, M.",0,1597

2003,Skeletal deficits in type 1 diabetes mellitus,"While type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) accounts for <10 % of all diabetes, studies suggest that the global incidence of T1D appears to be increasing by 2-3 % per year [ 1, 2 ], attributed to a variety of possible immune-modulatory factors which include societal changes in hygiene, infectious exposures, vitamin D defi ciency, and/or infant diets [ 1 ]. Diagnosis of the disease most commonly occurs in the pediatric population [ 3 ], with peaks in presentation occurring at school entry (5-7 years) and puberty (10-14 years) [ 2 ]. In the USA, prevalence of T1D has recently been estimated at 1 in every 433 youth <20 years of age [ 4 ]. T1D is, foremost, a state of insulin defi ciency due to the progressive, predominantly autoimmune-mediated, destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. As such, unlike type 2 diabetes (T2D), insulinopenia, rather than insulin secretory dysregulation, becomes the overriding phenotype of this disease and insulin replacement therapy is a necessity. In the last two decades, however, therapeutic options (insulin analogues, insulin pumps, continuous glucose sensors) [ 5 - 7 ] have advanced tremendously. And, in recent years, the use of insulin-pump therapy, in particular, continues to increase in an effort to more-tightly regulate glycemic control [ 8, 9 ]. Hence, understanding the protracted pathophysiology of adult diabetic bone disease in T1D requires an appreciation of the individual context in which this comorbidity has developed over an individual lifetime. The following pages will review skeletal defi - cits in T1D as they are currently understood, recognizing that the disease phenotype may change in the future, as treatment options continue to improve. ¬© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Thrailkill, K.

2007,Examination of the effect of bornfree activeflow baby bottles on infant colic,"Despite its benign, natural course, colic is a significant problem in babies and imparts a psychological and physical burden to parents. This study has examined the relief of colic symptoms when using BornFree ActiveFlow baby bottles by comparing observed symptoms of 30 otherwise healthy newborns (ages 2-21 weeks) who had all been diagnosed as having colic symptoms. Twenty of the babies were switched to feeding with BornFree bottles (the experimental group), while the other 10 babies continued feeding with bottles by other manufacturers (the control group). A significant improvement was exhibited in the experimental group after 1 week of feeding with BornFree bottles, with a further significant improvement in the second week. Although they had different venting systems, the control group maintained the same level of colic symptoms as in the beginning of the study. We conclude that using BornFree baby bottles can effectively reduce colic symptoms in diagnosed babies.Copyright ¬© 2013 Society of Gastroenterology Nurses and Associates.","Tikochinski, Y. and Kukliansky, I.",0,1602
2008,Maternal sleep and depressive symptoms: Links with infant Negative Affectivity,"This study assessed whether elevated severities of maternal depression and disturbed maternal sleep would be associated with maternal perceptions of higher Negative Affectivity of her infant. Sixty-nine mothers participated in this study. The study was part of a larger randomized controlled study testing the efficacy of acupuncture as a treatment for depression during pregnancy. The present study focused on data collected at 6 months postpartum in a naturalistic follow-up design, using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), maternal sleep diaries (completed daily for 1 week), and the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R).Regression analyses revealed that (a) maternal depression severity was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Distress and Falling Reactivity scales and (b) poor maternal sleep was a significant predictor of the IBQ-R Sadness scale.Our findings support previous findings of significant links between maternal emotional distress and perceived Negative Affectivity of her infant's temperament and provide a novel insight linking maternal poor sleep with perceived sadness of the infant. ¬© 2010.","Tikotzky, L. and Chambers, A.

2009,Postpartum maternal sleep and mothers' perceptions of their attachment relationship with the infant among women with a history of depression during pregnancy,"This study assessed the links between maternal sleep and mothers' perceptions of their attachment relationship with their infant among women at risk for postpartum depression by virtue of having been depressed during pregnancy. Sixty-two mothers completed sleep diaries and questionnaires at 3 and 6 months postpartum. Regression analyses, controlling for depression severity and infant temperament, revealed significant prospective correlation between maternal shorter total sleep time at 3 months and lower scores on a mother-infant attachment questionnaire at 6 months. At 6 months, the longer time mothers were awake tending to their infants the lower were their attachment scores. The findings suggest that improving sleep of mothers who suffered from prenatal depression may have a positive effect on mothers' self-reported relationship with their infants. ¬© 2012 The Author(s).","Tikotzky, L. and Chambers, A.

The scale was administered to 47 full-term healthy neonates. Of these, 40 were followed and the infant characteristics questionnaire was given at four months of age. Significant correlations were revealed between the neonatal assessment items from the clusters of orientation and motor maturity and the temperament factors ""fussy-difficult"" and ""unpredictable"". Items from the cluster of autonomic stability correlated with the temperament factor ""unadaptable."" These correlations possibly indicate that perceived temperament does reflect intrinsic infant qualities.","Tirosh, E. and Harel, J. and Abadi, J. and Berger, A. and Cohen, A.",0,1605
2011,A characterization of motion affecting pulse oximetry in 350 patients,"As part of an oximetry research effort in which plethysmographic data were collected from moving patients, a wide variety of patient motion affecting pulse oximetry was observed and characterized by the clinical incidence, type, severity and duration of patient motion. 350 patients were observed for movement in clinical settings, including ICU, SICU, MICU, PICU, NICU, OR and PACU, at 4 hospitals and on an ambulance. 20% (70) of the patients exhibited motion. Half (35) of the moving patients were instrumented to record oximetric, plethysmographic and/or acceleration information. 31% of NICU infants moved compared to only 7% of adults in ICUs. The most common noisy oximetry signals were caused by motion characterized by extending/flexing (/kicking in infants) and by clenching/pressing/rubbing. In infants, these motion types accounted for 53% and 11% of motion, respectively. Less common infant motion types were patient cares, shifting body position and cough/cry. The most common adult motions were equally divided among extend/flex, clench/press/rub, twitch/shake and transport motion types. Extend/flex motions typically demonstrated high plethysmographic waveform modulation (71.5% maximum) and high acceleration. Clench/press/rub motions typically also had high modulations, but low G-force. With one high-G exception, twitch/shake motions had little or no effect on oximetry readings. Less common adult motion types affecting pulse oximetry included cough/cry, strain/posture, tremors and tap/bump. Most recorded motions were aperiodic and short-lived, 62% lasting less than 10 seconds, only 5% lasting over 1 minute. NICU patients made the longest lasting continuous series of motions, while adults made 86% of the motions lasting a second or less.","Tobin, R. M. and Pologe, J. A. and Batchelder, P. B.",0,1606
2012,Improved lung function at age 6 in children born very preterm and fed extra protein post-discharge,"Background: In very preterm-born children, alveolar maturation is challenged and lung function is often compromised during childhood. So far, very few studies have focused on type of early nutrition and lung function in children born preterm. Methods: This study is a 6¬†years follow-up of 281 very preterm-born infants (VPI) with a gestational age (GA) <32¬†+¬†0¬†weeks. Infants breastfed at discharge from hospital were randomized to unfortified (UHM) or fortified (FHM) mother's (human) milk, whereas those not breastfed received a preterm formula (PF). The intervention lasted until 4¬†months corrected age. At 6¬†years of age fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), airway resistance and occlusion measurements with reversibility were performed. Data on predisposition to asthma and allergy as well as possible allergic symptoms of the child were obtained with questionnaires. Results: Outcome data was fully or partially available on 160 (66.9%) of 239 children. This included 49 (30.6%) children fed UHM, 58 (36.3%) fed FHM and 53 (33.1%) fed PF. Successful FeNO measurements were obtained in 119 (74.4%) children and airway resistance measurements in 160. FeNO results were not significantly different between feeding groups.

2013,Gastrointestinal tolerance of a pediatric fiber formula in developmentally disabled children,"We performed a masked, randomized, 2-month crossover study with developmentally disabled children to study the tolerance of a pediatric adapted enteral formula with added soy fiber. Twenty children and adolescents aged 1 to 17 years, requiring liquid nutrition, were fed Pediasure (PS) and Pediasure with approximately 10 g total dietary fiber/l, (PSF10) as their major source of energy and nutrient intake for 1 month each. During the two 4-week periods of the crossover study, intake, tolerance of the formula, and stool characteristics were monitored daily with diaries. Criteria for gastrointestinal tolerance were symptoms of emesis, gas, irritability or fussiness. Stool characteristics included frequency, consistency, and the need to use elimination aids to induce defecation. Following completion of the crossover study, the patients were fed PSF10 for an additional 2 months. Anthropometrics were obtained at study initiation and at each biweekly visit during the crossover phase and monthly during the follow-up phase. Bowel scintigraphy studies were conducted in patients with oral or nasogastric intake during the crossover periods. Biochemical assessments were conducted at entry, at the end of each crossover period, and at exit. There were no differences in any of the tolerance, stooling, growth, or biochemical measurements between the feeding regimens, in 11 children completing this phase of the study. However, there was a trend towards using less elimination aids to induce a bowel movement during the fiber supplemented formula phase. Pediasure with fiber is well tolerated in children with developmental disabilities. ¬© 1997 American College of Nutrition.","Tolia, V. and Ventimiglia, J. and Kuhns, L.",0,1608
2015,Characterizing Emergent Anxiety Through the Lens of Fragile X,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a single-gene disorder highly associated with anxiety, with over 75% of males meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for at least one anxiety disorder. Due to the known genetic mechanisms of FXS, examining emergent anxiety through the lens of FXS offers unique insight into the complex intersection of genetics, development, and environment. This work may inform both syndrome-specific patterns of risk, as well as general models of anxiety relevant to non-FXS populations. In this review, we synthesize the emergent literature on prodromal anxiety in young children with FXS with goals to (1) establish a working model for anxiety emergence in infants and toddlers with FXS and (2) identify current limitations and next steps needed to develop translational, phenotypically calibrated treatments. We present evidence that further investigating specific prodromal features of anxiety emergence in infants and toddlers with FXS may pave the way to identifying malleable markers of risk and resilience, which may be targeted to optimize child and family outcomes. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Tonnsen, B.

2016,The effectiveness of video interaction guidance in parents of premature infants: A multicenter randomised controlled trial,"Background: Studies have consistently found a high incidence of neonatal medical problems, premature births and low birth weights in abused and neglected children. One of the explanations proposed for the relation between neonatal problems and adverse parenting is a possible delay or disturbance in the bonding process between the parent and infant. This hypothesis suggests that due to neonatal problems, the development of an affectionate bond between the parent and the infant is impeded. The disruption of an optimal parent-infant bond -on its turn- may predispose to distorted parent-infant interactions and thus facilitate abusive or neglectful behaviours. Video Interaction Guidance (VIG) is expected to promote the bond between parents and newborns and is expected to diminish non-optimal parenting behaviour.Methods/design: This study is a multi-center randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of Video Interaction Guidance in parents of premature infants. In this study 210 newborn infants with their parents will be included: n = 70 healthy term infants (>37 weeks GA), n = 70 moderate term infants (32-37 weeks GA) which are recruited from maternity wards of 6 general hospitals and n = 70 extremely preterm infants or very low birth weight infants (<32 weeks GA) recruited by the NICU of 2 specialized hospitals. The participating families will be divided into 3 groups: a reference group (i.e. full term infants and their parents, receiving care as usual), a control group (i.e. premature infants and their parents, receiving care as usual) and an intervention group (i.e. premature infants and their parents, receiving VIG). The data will be collected during the first six months after birth using observations of parent-infant interactions, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Primary outcomes are the quality of parental bonding and parent-infant interactive behaviour. Parental secondary outcomes are (posttraumatic) stress symptoms, depression, anxiety and feelings of anger and hostility. Infant secondary outcomes are behavioral aspects such as crying, eating, and sleeping.Discussion: This is the first prospective study to empirically evaluate the effect of VIG in parents of premature infants. Family recruitment is expected to be completed in January 2012. First results should be available by 2012.Trail registration number: NTR3423. ¬© 2012 Tooten et al.","Tooten, A. and Hoffenkamp, H.

2017,Anaphylaxis in infancy compared with older children,"Although there has been increasing data on pediatric anaphylaxis, information about anaphylaxis in the 1st year of life is scarce. This study provides detailed information on clinical signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis in the 1st year of life. A retrospective review was performed of our pediatric allergy database between 2007 and 2011. Children who met the diagnostic criteria of anaphylaxis were included. They were categorized as ""infant"" if they were ‚â§12 months of age at the time of anaphylactic reaction and ""children"" if >12 months. There were 104 patients (60 male and 44 female subjects) who met the diagnosis criteria of anaphylaxis. From the 104 cases of anaphylaxis, 23 (22.1%) were infants. Boys (p = 0.043), atopic eczema (p = 0.049), and history of food allergy (p < 0.001) were significantly higher in infants than in children with anaphylaxis. Severe anaphylaxis was less frequent in infants than in children (p = 0.04). There was no significant difference between infants and children considering cutaneous and respiratory symptoms (p > 0.05 for both) but persistent vomiting was (p = 0.023). Irritability, persistent crying, and somnolence are the signs which are difficult to interpret in infants with anaphylaxis. Within these signs, irritability, persistent crying, and somnolence were present in 69.6, 43.5, and 26.1% of infants, respectively.

They were subdivided in five groups: asymptomatic (33%), symptomatic (28%), dubious tuberculous infections (35%), high-risk contacts (3%) and unestablished diagnosis (1%). They were aged from 10 days to 19 years, and 82% of them were migrants of low socio-economic level. Fifty percent of the symptomatic infections, mainly pulmonary, appeared in children under 3 years of age. An adult source of contamination was identified in 33% of the case (48% of the symptomatic children). Diagnosis was based on tuberculin screening with a 2IU intradermal test. Gastric aspirates yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 15% of our patients, 11% of them showing resistance to one or more tuberculostatic drugs. Treatment was given to 1359 patients with excellent results. Therapy was shortened during the last 2 years of the study from 12 to 6 months for the asymptomatic patients and from 12 to 9 months for the symptomatic infections. Few complications were observed. Tuberculosis remains a serious cause of morbidity particularly in migrant children.

This qualitative study examines provider and child (18 months ‚àí4 years) feeding interactions. Trained data collectors observed 200 eating occasions in 48 family child care homes and recorded providers‚Äô responses to children's meal and snack time behaviors. Child behaviors initiating provider feeding practices were identified and practices were coded according to higher order constructs identified in a recent feeding practices content map. Analysis examined the most common feeding practices providers used to respond to each child behavior. Providers were predominately female (100%), African-American (75%), and obese (77%) and a third of children were overweight/obese (33%). Commonly observed child behaviors were: verbal and non-verbal refusals, verbal and non-verbal acceptance, being ‚Äúall done‚Äù, attempts for praise/attention, and asking for seconds. Children's acceptance of food elicited more autonomy supportive practices vs. coercive controlling. Requests for seconds was the most common behavior, resulting in coercive controlling practices (e.g., insisting child eat certain food or clean plate). Future interventions should train providers on responding to children's behaviors and helping children become more aware of internal satiety and hunger cues. ¬© 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Tovar, A. and Vaughn, A.

2025,Breastfeeding structure as a test of parental investment theory in Papua New Guinea,"Evolutionary parental investment theory predicts that parents invest preferentially in offspring best able to translate investments into fitness payoffs. It has also been proposed that where the reproductive prospects of offspring are directly correlated with parental investment and variance in fertility is higher for males than females, parents in better condition should bias investment toward males while those in poorer condition should bias investment toward females. Lactation is arguably among the costliest forms of investment expended by mothers and is thus expected to be allocated in ways consistent with fitness payoffs. Quantitative data collected among 110 Papua New Guinean mother-infant pairs during 470 h of focal follows on nursing frequency and duration and responses to infant demands by maternal and offspring characteristics are presented to provide empirically-based descriptions of infant care and tests of evolutionary parental investment theory. Results indicate that mothers show very high levels of investment in offspring. However, although breastfeeding in developing countries is often characterized as on-demand, fussing and crying by infants were only attended to with breastfeeding about 30% of the time. Contrary to expectations of parental investment theory that parents should invest less in poorer quality offspring, mothers increased investment in offspring in poorer condition. The expectation that mothers in better condition would bias investment toward male offspring was also not supported","Tracer, D. P.",0,1616

2029,LMA Supreme for neonatal resuscitation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The most important action in the resuscitation of a newborn in the delivery room is to establish effective assisted ventilation. The face mask and endotracheal tube are the devices used to achieve this goal. Laryngeal mask airways that fit over the laryngeal inlet have been shown to be effective for ventilating newborns at birth and should be considered as an alternative to facemask ventilation or endotracheal intubation among newborns weighing >2,000¬†g or delivered ‚â•34¬†weeks' gestation. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of supraglottic airways in neonatal resuscitation reported the results of four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) stating that fewer infants in the group using laryngeal mask airways required endotracheal intubation (1.5%) compared to the group using face masks (12.0%). However, there were methodological concerns over all the RCTs including the fact that the majority of the operators in the trials were anesthesiologists.Our hypothesis is based on the assumption that ventilating newborns needing positive pressure ventilation with a laryngeal mask airway will be more effective than ventilating with a face mask in a setting where neonatal resuscitation is performed by midwives, nurses, and pediatricians. The primary aim of this study will be to assess the effectiveness of the laryngeal mask airway over the face mask in preventing the need for endotracheal intubation. METHODS/DESIGN: This will be an open, prospective, randomized, single center, clinical trial. In this study, 142 newborns weighing >1,500¬†g or delivered ‚â•34¬†weeks gestation needing positive pressure ventilation at birth will be randomized to be ventilated with a laryngeal mask airway (LMA SupremeTM, LMA Company, UK - intervention group) or with a face mask (control group).

2032,Infant sleep problems: A qualitative analysis of first-time mothers' coping experience,"Objective: to describe the aspects of infant sleep perceived as problematic by first-time Taiwanese mothers and to discover how mothers cope in response to infant sleep concerns. Design: a qualitative approach was used for data collection. Setting: in-depth interviews were conducted and audio-taped at mothers' homes. Participants: 12 first-time mothers within three months post partum. Measurement and findings: content analysis was performed to identify patterns, similarities, and differences in the individual and collective interview data. The major themes describing maternal coping experiences were 'self-help' and 'seek-help.' Self-help coping efforts included reception and acceptance of suggestions as well as changing behaviour to allow mothers to feel capable of adapting to infant sleep patterns or problems. Seek-help was a later stage of coping for mothers when they actively utilised formal and informal sources of help to identify and manage infant sleep problems. The majority of mothers sought informal help sources from family members, friends, or online information. Mothers who suspected their infant of suffering from sleep problems either delayed seeking medical advice or did not actively consult a health care provider. Conclusions and implications for practice: nurses and health care providers who work in antenatal, postnatal, and paediatric clinics should actively educate and provide information about infant sleep patterns and sleep management options to first-time mothers and discuss maternal coping strategies. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Tsai, S.

2033,Infant sleep problems: The sleep characteristics of the ‚ÄúDon't Know‚Äù response,"Aims: To examine the sleep characteristics of infants with parentally reported sleep problems, with parentally reported no sleep problems and with parentally reported uncertain sleep conditions. Background: Infant sleep problems are recognized as a major health issue worldwide. However, in our daily clinical practices, it is not uncommon for parents not to know whether their infant sleep is problematic. Design and Methods: A prospective study conducted between 2012 - 2015 where 219 parents completed questionnaires and infants wore an actigraph monitor for 7¬†days. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to evaluate the actigraphic and parentally reported infant sleep behaviours between the groups. Results: Thirty-two (14.61%) parents did not know whether their infant sleep was problematic and 118 (53.88%) parents considered their infant sleep a problem. Compared with infants without sleep problems, infants with uncertain sleep conditions had significantly increased odds of having shortened longest sleep duration according to parental report. A significant association was found for infants without sleep problems compared with those with sleep problems who had significantly more wake after sleep onset as measured by actigraphy, as well as reduced longest sleep duration according to parental report. Conclusion: Infants with uncertain sleep conditions have the same problematic sleep behaviours resembling those of children with reported sleep problems. Healthcare professionals should actively disseminate sleep knowledge to help parents interpret infant sleep behaviours and consider possible intervention strategies for improving parental sleep-related knowledge and infant sleep. ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Tsai, S.

2035,The Relationship Between Planned and Reported Home Infant Sleep Locations Among Mothers of Late Preterm and Term Infants,"To compare maternal report of planned and practiced home sleep locations of infants born late preterm (34 0/7 to 36 6/7 gestational weeks) with those infants born term (‚â•37 0/7 gestational weeks) over the first postpartum month. Open-ended semi-structured maternal interviews were conducted in a US hospital following birth and by phone at 1¬†month postpartum during 2010‚Äì2012. Participants were 56 mother‚Äìinfant dyads: 26 late preterm and 30 term. Most women planned to room share at home with their infants and reported doing so for some or all of the first postpartum month. More women reported bed sharing during the first postpartum month than had planned to do so in both the late preterm and term groups. The primary reason for unplanned bed sharing was to soothe nighttime infant fussiness. Those participants who avoided bed sharing at home commonly discussed their fear for infant safety. A few parents reported their infants were sleeping propped on pillows and co-sleeping on a recliner. Some women in both the late preterm and term groups reported lack of opportunity to obtain a bassinet prior to childbirth. The discrepancy between plans for infant sleep location at home and maternally reported practices were similar in late preterm and term groups. Close maternal proximity to their infants at night was derived from the need to assess infant well-being, caring for infants, and women‚Äôs preferences. Bed sharing concerns related to infant safety and the establishment of an undesirable habit, and alternative arrangements included shared recliner sleep. ¬© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Tully, K.

2037,Dialysate CA125 levels in children on continuous peritoneal dialysis,"This prospective study was conducted to assess dialysate cancer antigen 125 (dCA125) levels in pediatric peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and to investigate whether it exhibits any alterations during or after recovery from peritonitis, and also to analyze the relationships between dCA125 and age, duration of PD treatment, peritonitis incidence, time passed since the last episode of peritonitis, PD prescription parameters, and peritoneal transport parameters. Forty-seven standardized 4-h peritoneal equilibration tests (PET) were performed in 38 children (mean age 11.6¬±4.7 years) on PD (duration 20.9¬±14.3 months). Thirty-two of the patients were in stable condition at the time of PET (stable group). Six patients were included in the study only during a peritonitis episode, and two of the stable patients were reevaluated during a peritonitis episode afterwards (peritonitis group). Seven out of a total of eight patients with acute peritonitis were reexamined after recovery (recovery group). CA125 levels were measured in 188 samples at 0-, 1-, 2-, and 4-h dwells. Peritoneal appearance rates (AR) were calculated. Mean dCA125 (4 h) and AR CA125 values were 5.6¬±5.3 U/ml [median 4.15 U/ml/4 h (range 0.5-25.9)] and 50.1¬±45.6 U/min/1.73 m2[median 37.91 U/ml/1.73 m2 (range 3.61-223.39)]. AR CA125 levels did not correlate with age, PD duration, peritonitis incidence, time passed since the last peritonitis episode, exchange volume used per m2 per day, or peritoneal transport properties in the stable patients group. Although stable patients using hypertonic PD solutions (n=16) had slightly lower AR CA125 levels (p=0.04), multivariate analysis showed no influence of hypertonic dextrose solutions on mesothelial CA125 secretion (p=0.4). During acute peritonitis, CA125 concentrations showed a reversible threefold increase [AR CA125: stable 37.9 vs. peritonitis 101.2 U/ml/1.73 m2 (p =0.001)]. No difference could be found between the stable group and the recovery group. We conclude that changes in the peritoneal mesothelial cell mass cannot be assessed by determining CA125 in a cross-sectional way and that longitudinal determinations could be more valuable in the follow-up of patients. ¬© IPNA 2005.","Turhan, P. and Sever, L. and Caliskan, S. and Kasapcopur, O. and Sever, A. and Hacibekiroglu, M. and Arisoy, N.",0,1627
2038,Anesthesia management with single injection paravertebral block for aorta coarctation in infant,"BACKGROUND: Thoracotomy causes severe pain in the postoperative period. Perioperative thoracic paravertebral block reduces pain score and may improve outcome after pediatric cardiac surgery. This prospective study was designed for the efficacy and duration of a single level, single injection ultrasound-guided thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) for fifteen infants undergoing aortic coarctation repair. METHODS: After approval of the ethical committee and the relatives of the patients, 15 infants who had undergone thoracotomy were enrolled in the study. The patients received 0.5 ml¬∑kg(-1) a bolus 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine 1 : 200 000 at T5-6 level after standard general anesthesia induction. Anesthesia depth with Index of Consciousness (IOC) and tissue oxygen saturation with cerebral (rSO2-C) and somatic thoracodorsal (rSO2-S) were monitored. Intraoperative hemodynamic and postoperative hemodynamic and pain scores were evaluated for 24 h after surgery. Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) score was utilized to measure postoperative pain in the intensive care unit. Rescue 0.05 mg¬∑kg(-1) IV morphine was applied to patients in whom FLACC was >3. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 4.5 (1-11) months, and the median intraoperative endtidal isoflurane concentration was 0.6% (0.3-0.8). The amount of remifentanil used intraoperatively was 4.5 (2.5-14) Œºg¬∑kg(-) (1) ¬∑h(-1). Intraoperative heart rate and blood pressure values significantly decreased compared with values detected at 5th, 10th, and 15th min after TPVB application, after incision prior and after cross-clamp (P < 0.01). The median time of first dose of morphine application after block was 320 (185-430) min. The median morphine consumption in 24 h was 0.16 (0.09-0.4) mg¬∑kg(-1). The median length of postoperative intensive care unit and in-hospital stay times was 23 (1-67) h and 4 (1-10) days, respectively.

2039,Strengthening the predictive power of screening for adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in younger and older children,"Background: There is increasing interest in routine screening for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) to help identify high-risk children who would benefit from interventions. However, there has not yet been sufficient research concerning which particular set of ACEs would be most predictive as a potential screening tool. Objective: This study compared 40 Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), covering 11 different conceptual domains, in their ability to predict trauma symptoms in childhood. Participants and setting: The current study uses pooled data from three National Surveys of Children's Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV) conducted in 2008, 2011, and 2014. Each survey collected information on children aged one month to 17 years. Methods: Samples were obtained from a mix of random digit dialing and address based sampling methods. Telephone interviews were conducted with children 10 years and older and with caregivers, if the randomly selected child was under age 10. Results and conclusion: A different set of 15 items best predicted trauma symptoms for younger (2‚àí9-year-old) compared to older (10‚àí17-year-old) youth. Some conventional ACEs, like physical and emotional abuse, proved important for both age groups. However, family-related factors were more predictive for younger children, while community and peer violence exposures were more predictive for older children. Our new proposed measures explained substantially more variance in subsequent trauma symptoms than did the original ACE measure (R2 =.31 vs.18 for 2-9 year olds","Turner, H.

2042,A Consideration of Maternal Developmental Needs in the Treatment of Infant Sleep Problems,"Parents often seek help because of difficulties their infants have transitioning to and maintaining sleep. Sleep problems almost inevitably adversely impact parental sleep which can affect the parent‚Äôs psychological state and the parent‚Äìinfant relationship. This paper examines interventions for infant sleep problems within a context that includes recognition of maternal developmental needs. Clinical case material of mothers in different stages of adult development illustrates ways in which maternal developmental needs both influenced their children‚Äôs sleep patterns that became problematic and the resolution of those sleep difficulties. An approach to infant sleep problems that encompasses the mother‚Äôs developmental stage can broaden our understanding of mothers‚Äô reactions to their infants‚Äô sleep and be used to inform treatment. Developing sleep recommendations for infants and toddlers within a context that focuses on the developmental needs of both mother and child has the potential for improving sleep and promoting more positive parent‚Äìchild relationships. ¬© 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Twomey, J.

2043,The rights of children for optimal development and nurturing care,"Millions of children are subjected to abuse, neglect, and displacement, and millions more are at risk for not achieving their developmental potential. Although there is a global movement to change this, driven by children's rights, progress is slow and impeded by political considerations. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a global comprehensive commitment to children's rights ratified by all countries in the world except the United States (because of concerns about impingement on sovereignty and parental authority), has a special General Comment on ""Implementing Child Rights in Early Childhood."" More recently, the World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund have launched the Nurturing Care Framework for Early Childhood Development (ECD), which calls for public policies that promote nurturing care interventions and addresses 5 interrelated components that are necessary for optimal ECD. This move is also complemented by the Human Capital Project of the World Bank, providing a focus on the need for investments in child health and nutrition and their long-term benefits. In this article, we outline children's rights under international law, the underlying scientific evidence supporting attention to ECD, and the philosophy of nurturing care that ensures that children's rights are respected, protected, and fulfilled. We also provide pediatricians anywhere with the policy and rights-based frameworks that are essential for them to care for and advocate for children and families to ensure optimal developmental, health, and socioemotional outcomes.

2044,Adaptation of pain scales for parent observation: are pain scales and symptoms useful in detecting pain of young children with the suspicion of acute otitis media?,"BACKGROUND: The assessment of ear pain is challenging in young, mostly preverbal children. Our aim was to investigate whether pain scales are useful tools for parents to detect pain in their young children with the suspicion of acute otitis media (AOM), and to assess associations between 16 symptoms and the severity of pain. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 426 children (6-35‚Äâmonths) with symptoms suggestive of AOM. We surveyed symptoms and pain via parental interview. As part of the interview, parents assessed their child's pain by using two pain scales: The Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R) and the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) Scale. The outcome of interest was moderate/severe pain. We used the œá(2) test or Fisher's test as applicable to compare the severity of pain between three parental pain assessment methods (the parental interview, the FPS-R and the FLACC Scale). We also used multivariable logistic regression models to study the association between the severity of pain and AOM and to study the association between symptoms and the severity of pain. RESULTS: In children with AOM (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ201), pain was assessed by parents as moderate/severe in 65% via interview","Uitti, J. M. and Salanter√§, S. and Laine, M. K. and T√§htinen, P.

2045,Prebiotic oligosaccharides in premature infants,"OBJECTIVE:: The aim of the study was to determine the impact of increasing doses of 2 prebiotic oligosaccharides and of an ""all-human diet"" on the intestinal microbiota of premature infants. METHODS:: Twelve premature infants receiving formula feedings were randomly assigned to receive either galacto-oligosaccharide (F+GOS) or a pooled concentrated donor human milk product containing human milk oligosaccharides (F+HMO) in increasing doses during a 5-week period. A second group of 15 premature infants received their mother√äs own milk fortified with either a concentrated donor human milk product (H+H) or a bovine powdered fortifier (H+B). Serial stool specimens from each infant were analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for bacterial composition. RESULTS:: All of the infants studied had relatively low levels of bifidobacteria and no measurable Lactobacilli. Infants from the F+GOS and F+HMO groups demonstrated an increase in relative numbers of Clostridia with increasing doses. Compared with the H+B group, the infants in the F+HMO and the H+H groups showed an unexpected trend toward an increase in Œ≥-Proteobacteria over time/dose. Principal coordinate analyses and Shannon diversity scores were not significantly different among the 4 groups. Infants in the H+H group received more antibiotics during the study period than those in the other groups. Two of the infants receiving GOS developed feeding intolerance.

METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial involved 81 full-term neonates, up to 4 wk of postnatal age, who needed venepuncture for blood investigations. Two minutes before the venepuncture, in the intervention arm, 40 babies received 5 ml of EBM, while 41 babies in control group received 5 ml of distilled water (DW) as placebo. Two observers who were blinded to the intervention recorded the physiological (heart rate and oxygen saturation) and behavioural parameters [duration of crying and modified Neonatal Facial Coding Scores (NFCS)] after the venepuncture. RESULTS: There was no difference in the baseline characteristics of the neonates in the two groups. The duration of crying was significantly shorter in babies fed EBM [median 38.5 s, interquartile range (IQR) 9.5-57.5 s] than in those fed DW (median 90 s, IQR 28-210 s). The mean duration of crying in EBM group was shorter by 70.7 (95% confidence interval 36.6-104.9) s. The modified NFCS at 0, 1 and 3 min was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in the EBM than in the DW group. The change in heart rate and oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the EBM group and returned to baseline values sooner than in the DW group. CONCLUSION: Feeding 5 ml of EBM before venepuncture is effective in reducing symptoms due to pain in term neonates.","Upadhyay, A. and Aggarwal, R. and Narayan, S. and Joshi, M. and Paul, V.

Study Design: A case control study. Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted at the Institute of Child Health, Multan, Pakistan and Pediatrics Department, Services Hospital, Lahore Pakistan from October 2018 to March 2019. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 100 cases and 100 controls from outpatient facilities for this study. Cases were considered as babies of both genders who had IC as per Wessel‚Äôs criteria and having age less than 3 months. Controls were babies attending clinic without colic and who were more than 3 weeks to 3 months of age. Demographic, maternal and obstetrical data was recorded and compared between cases and controls. Results: Most of the cases with IC, 53 (53.0%) were females, aged 4 to 6 weeks 53 (53.0%) and were having mixed feeding 38 (38.0%). Mean age of the cases was recorded as 5.2 weeks in comparison to a mean of 6.2 weeks in control group (p < 0.0001). Mean daily sleep duration was recorded to be 9.52 hours vs 13.12 hours in control group (p < 0.0001). Crying at night (p = 0.003) was turned out to be a factor significantly associated with IC (p > 0.05). Conclusion: IC is a frequent problem in younger infants. Night crying and comparatively less sleep time per day was noted babies with IC.

2050,Language emergence in infants,"Discusses a model for the early stages of child lanuage development and psychogenesis. In the initial stage, occurring from birth to 1 mo, newborns begin to perceive some traits of human speech, while crying is a quite rudimentary form of future speech skill. At the 2nd stage (aged 1‚Äì4 mo), communication with adults is clear and distinct, and spontaneous babbling occurs. In the 3rd stage (aged 4‚Äì8 mo), the duration of communication increases, special forms of communication appear, and a preference develops for sound patterns typical of their native language. In the 4th stage (aged 8‚Äì12 mo), communication becomes conventionalized and different kinds of crying and long-lasting vocalizations occur. As the whole communication frame has matured, words then begin to appear. There seems to exist a special mechanism, inborn in the human brain, that functions to exteriorize internal subjective states by means of movement, among which vocalization has an important place.

2054,Copenhagen infant mental health project: Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial comparing circle of security -parenting and care as usual as interventions targeting infant mental health risks,"Background: Infant mental health is a significant public health issue as early adversity and exposure to early childhood stress are significant risk factors that may have detrimental long-term developmental consequences for the affected children. Negative outcomes are seen on a range of areas such as physical and mental health, educational and labor market success, social network and establishing of family. Secure attachment is associated with optimal outcomes in all developmental domains in childhood, and both insecure and disorganized attachment are associated with a range of later problems and psychopathologies. In disadvantaged populations insecure and disorganized attachment are common, which points to the need of identifying early risk and effective methods of addressing such problems. This protocol describes an experimental evaluation of an indicated group-based parental educational program, Circle of Security-Parenting (COS-P), currently being conducted in Denmark. Methods/design: In a parallel randomized controlled trial of two intervention groups this study tests the efficacy of COS-P compared to Care as Usual (CAU) in enhancing maternal sensitivity and child attachment in a community sample in the City of Copenhagen, Denmark. During the project a general population of an estimated 17.600 families with an infant aged 2-12 months are screened for two known infant mental health risks, maternal postnatal depression and infant social withdrawal. Eligible families (N = 314), who agree to participate, will be randomly allocated with a ratio of 2:1 into the COS-P intervention arm and into CAU. Data will be obtained at inclusion (baseline) and at follow-up when the child is 12-16 months. The primary outcome is maternal sensitivity. Secondary outcomes include quality of infant attachment, language, cognitive and socioemotional development, family functioning, parental stress, parental mentalizing and maternal mental wellbeing. Discussion: The potential implications of the experimental evaluation of an indicated brief group-based parenting educational program to enhance parental sensitivity and attachment are discussed.

2059,Probiotics for Preterm Infants: A Strain-Specific Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis,"Objectives: Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the use of probiotics to reduce morbidity and mortality in preterm infants have provided inconsistent results. Although meta-analyses that group all of the used strains together are suggesting efficacy, it is not possible to determine the most effective strain that is more relevant to the clinician. We therefore used a network meta-analysis (NMA) approach to identify strains with greatest efficacy. Methods: A PubMed search identified placebo-controlled or head-to-head RCTs investigating probiotics in preterm infants. From trials that recorded mortality, necrotizing enterocolitis, late-onset sepsis, or time until full enteral feeding as outcomes, data were extracted and Bayesian hierarchical random-effects models were run to construct a NMA. Results: Fifty-one RCTs involving 11,231 preterm infants were included. Most strains or combinations of strains were only studied in one or a few RCTs. Only 3 of 25 studied probiotic treatment combinations showed significant reduction in mortality rates. Seven treatments reduced necrotizing enterocolitis incidence, 2 reduced late-onset sepsis, and 3 reduced time until full enteral feeding. There was no clear overlap of strains, which were effective on multiple outcome domains. Conclusions: This NMA showed efficacy in reducing mortality and morbidity only in a minority of the studied strains or combinations. This may be due to an inadequate number, or size, of RCTs, or due to a true lack of effect for certain species. Further large and adequately powered RCTs using strains with the greatest apparent efficacy will be needed to more precisely define optimal treatment strategies. ¬© 2018 by European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.","Van Den Akker, C.

2060,Signs and symptoms in children with a serious infection: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of serious infections in children is difficult in general practice, as incidence is low, patients present themselves at an early stage of the disease and diagnostic tools are limited to signs and symptoms from observation, clinical history and physical examination. Little is known which signs and symptoms are important in general practice. With this qualitative study, we aimed to identify possible new important diagnostic variables. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with parents and physicians of children with a serious infection. We investigated all signs and symptoms that were related to or preceded the diagnosis. The analysis was done according to the grounded theory approach. Participants were recruited in general practice and at the hospital. RESULTS: 18 children who were hospitalised because of a serious infection were included. On average, parents and paediatricians were interviewed 3 days after admittance of the child to hospital, general practitioners between 5 and 8 days after the initial contact. The most prominent diagnostic signs in seriously ill children were changed behaviour, crying characteristics and the parents' opinion. Children either behaved drowsy or irritable and cried differently, either moaning or an inconsolable, loud crying. The parents found this illness different from previous illnesses, because of the seriousness or duration of the symptoms, or the occurrence of a critical incident. Classical signs, like high fever, petechiae or abnormalities at auscultation were helpful for the diagnosis when they were present, but not helpful when they were absent. CONCLUSION: behavioural signs and symptoms were very prominent in children with a serious infection. They will be further assessed for diagnostic accuracy in a subsequent, quantitative diagnostic study.","Van den Bruel, A. and Bruyninckx, R. and Vermeire, E. and Aerssens, P. and Aertgeerts, B. and Buntinx, F.",0,1645

2062,Picky eating: Associations with child eating characteristics and food intake,"Food rejection behaviors such as picky eating are of concern for many parents and attempts to increase healthy food intake can cause distress at mealtimes. An important limitation in most of the picky eating studies is that they cover few characteristics of picky eating behaviors and use limited measures of food intake. The objective of this study was to explore the associations between picky eating, child eating characteristics, and food intake among toddlers 12-47.9 months old (n = 2371) using data from the 2008 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS). Logistic regression was used to examine associations between demographic and feeding characteristics and picky eater status. Differences in food group intake between picky and non-picky eaters were analyzed. Picky eaters were more likely to be neophobic, texture resistant, and to eat only favorite foods, In addition, the parents of picky eaters tend to offer new food a greater number of times than those of non-picky eaters before deciding that the child does not like it. Picky eaters showed significant lower intakes of eggs, burritos/tacos/enchiladas/nachos and sandwiches than non-picky eaters. Picky eaters consumed fewer vegetables from the ""other vegetables"" category and less raw vegetables than non-picky eaters. Neophobia, eating only favorite foods and difficulties with texture are all important characteristics of picky eaters which need to be integrated in studies measuring picky eating behaviors. Food intake of picky eaters differs only slightly from non-picky eaters. Because picky eating is a major parental concern, feeding strategies and advice related to the relevant characteristics of picky eating behavior need to be developed and assessed for their effectiveness. ¬© 2016 The Authors.","van der Horst, K. and Deming, D.

These parenting clusters were further explored to see how they differed in the use of feeding strategies (i.e. feeding styles and food parenting practices) and by reported child eating styles. Methods An online survey with 1005 mothers/caregivers (legal guardians) with at least one child between 12 and 36 months old was conducted in the United States in 2012, assessing general parenting behavior, feeding style, food parenting practices and the child eating styles. Results A three cluster solution of parenting style was found and clusters were labelled as overprotective/supervising, authoritarian, and authoritative. The clusters differed in terms of general parenting behaviors. Both overprotective and authoritative clusters showed high scores on structure, behavioral control, and nurturance. The overprotective cluster scored high on overprotection. The 'authoritarian' cluster showed lowest levels of nurturance, structure and behavioral control. Overprotective and authoritative parents showed very similar patterns in the use of food parenting practices, e.g. monitoring food intake, modeling, and promoting healthy food intake and availability at home. Overprotective parents also reported higher use of pressure to eat and involvement. Authoritarian parents reported high use of giving the child control over their food behaviors, emotion regulation, using food as a reward, and controlling food intake for weight control. Children's eating styles did not largely vary by parenting cluster. Conclusion This study showed that a relatively new parenting style of overprotection is relevant for children's eating behaviors. Overprotective parents reported food parenting practices that are known to be beneficial for children's food intake, such as modelling healthy food intake, as well as more unfavorable practices such as pressure. Longitudinal data on parenting practices and their relation to healthy eating in children is needed to inform communication and interventions for parents, reinforcing key feeding strategies which have positive effects on child eating behaviors and addressing parenting styles that have unintended negative effects. ¬© 2017 van der Horst, Sleddens.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.","Van Der Horst, K. and Sleddens, E.

2064,"Baby's first bites: A randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of vegetable-exposure and sensitive feeding on vegetable acceptance, eating behavior and weight gain in infants and toddlers","Background: The start of complementary feeding in infancy plays an essential role in promoting healthy eating habits. Evidence shows that it is important what infants are offered during this first introduction of solid foods: e.g. starting exclusively with vegetables is more successful for vegetable acceptance than starting with fruits. How infants are introduced to solid foods also matters: if parents are sensitive and responsive to infant cues during feeding, this may promote self-regulation of energy intake and a healthy weight. However, the effectiveness of the what and the how of complementary feeding has never been experimentally tested in the same study. In the current project the what and how (and their combination) are tested in one study to determine their relative importance for fostering vegetable acceptance and self-regulation of energy intake in infants. Methods: A four-arm randomized controlled trial (Baby's First Bites (BFB)) was designed for 240 first-time Dutch mothers and their infants, 60 per arm. In this trial, we compare the effectiveness of (a) a vegetable-exposure intervention focusing on the what in complementary feeding","Van Der Veek, S. M. C. and De Graaf, C. and De Vries, J. H.

2065,Mothers' reports of infant crying and soothing in a multicultural population,"Objectives-To investigate the prevalence of infant crying and maternal soothing techniques in relation to ethnic origin and other sociodemographic variables. Design-A questionnaire survey among mothers of 2-3 month old infants registered at six child health clinics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Subjects-A questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics and crying behaviour was completed for 1826 of 2180 (84%) infants invited with their parents to visit the child health clinics. A questionnaire on soothing techniques was also rifled out at home for 1142 (63%) of these infants. Results-Overall prevalences of 'crying for three or more hours/24 hour day', 'crying a lot', and 'difficult to comfort' were 7.6%, 14.0%, and 10.3%, respectively. Problematic infant crying was reported by 20.3% of the mothers. Of these infants, only 14% met all three inclusion criteria. Problematic crying occurred less frequently among girls, second and later born children, Surinamese infants, and breast fed infants. Many mothers used soothing techniques that could affect their infant's health negatively. Shaking, slapping, and putting the baby to sleep in a prone position were more common among non-Dutch (especially Turkish) mothers than among Dutch mothers. Poorly educated mothers slapped their baby more often than highly educated mothers. Conclusions-Mothers' reports of infant crying and soothing varied sociodemographically. Much harm may be prevented by counselling parents (especially immigrants) on how and how not to respond to infant crying. Health education should start before the child's birth, because certain soothing techniques could be fatal, even when practised for the first time.","Van Der Wal, M. F. and Van Den Boom, D.

2067,Gastroesophageal reflux symptoms in infants in a rural population: Longitudinal data over the first six months,"Background: Increasing numbers of infants are receiving prescription medications for symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux. Our aim was to prospectively measure reported gastroesophageal reflux symptoms in healthy term infants for the first six months of life.Methods: In a prospective cohort study in the rural Upper Peninsula of Michigan, 128 consecutive maternal-infant pairs were followed for six months and administered the Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire Revised (I-GERQ-R) at the one-month, two-month, four-month, and six-month well-child visits.Results: The I-GERQ-R scores decreased with age. Average scores were 11.74 (SE = 5.97) at one-month, 9.97(4.92) at two-months, 8.44(4.39) at four-months, and 6.97(4.05) at six months.

2068,Are infant crying and maternal responsiveness during the first year related to infant‚Äìmother attachment at 15 months?,"Replicated and extended S. M. Bell and M. D. Ainsworth's (1972) Baltimore study on maternal responsiveness, infant crying and infant attachment security in a longitudinal investigation. Each of the 50 families were observed at home 12 times at 3 wk intervals during the 1st 9 mo, and infant crying behavior as well as maternal responses were recorded. Mothers and their infants were observed in the Strange Situation procedure at 15 mo of age. Descriptive results show that infants produced about the same number of crying bouts across the 1st 40 wks after birth, but the duration of the bouts decreased by half during this period. The duration of crying peaked in the 1st 9 wks. The descriptive data are remarkably similar to the findings of Bell and Ainsworth. Maternal responsiveness influenced crying behavior. Contrary to the authors expectations, the more frequently mothers ignored their infants' crying bouts in the 1st 9-wk period, the less frequently their infants cried in the following 9-wk period, even if intervening variables like earlier crying and synchronous responsiveness were controlled for. Mothers of avoidant infants responded most promptly to their infants' crying. The failure to replicate the Baltimore findings was interpreted in terms of 'differential responsiveness'.

2069,Comparison of behavior modification with and without swaddling as interventions for excessive crying,"Objective: To test the hypothesis that swaddling is an effective method to reduce crying, we compared a standardized approach of regularity and stimulus reduction with the same approach supplemented with swaddling. Study design: Healthcare nurses coached 398 excessively crying infants up to 12 weeks of age for 3 months. Outcome measurements were crying as measured by Barr's 24-hour diary and parental perception of crying. Results: Crying decreased by 42% in both groups after the first intervention week. Swaddling had no added benefit in the total group. Young infants (1-7 weeks of age at randomization) benefited significantly more from swaddling as shown by a larger decrease of crying over the total intervention period. Older infants (8-13 weeks of age at randomization) showed a significantly greater decrease in crying when offered the standardized approach without swaddling. The actual difference in crying time was 10 minutes. Conclusion: For older babies, swaddling did not bring any benefit when added to regularity and stimuli reduction in baby care, although swaddling was a beneficial supplementation in excessively crying infants <8 weeks of age. ¬© 2006 Mosby, Inc.

2070,Towards better triage of infants suspected of cow's milk allergy: development of a preliminary multivariable diagnostic index,"The double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) is currently the gold standard to diagnose cow's milk allergy (CMA). However, DBPCFCs are burdensome, expensive and require specialised facilities. For primary care physicians, selective and consistent referral to DBPCFC of infants suspected of CMA may be difficult. The objective of this study was to assess the predictive value of clinical parameters for a positive DBPCFC in infants suspected of CMA. Clinical data from 124 infants suspected of CMA that had undergone a DBPCFC were collected. Out of a total of 23 parameters, nine candidate predictors were selected on clinical grounds. We used bootstrapped logistic regression analysis to find a more parsimonious and practical model. The prevalence of a positive DBPCFC was 34.7 % (95 % CI from 27 to 43). A well-calibrated diagnostic model containing as predictors abdominal cramps, inconsolable crying and the objective SCORAD index discriminated moderately well between infants with and without a positive DBPCFC. The area under the ROC curve was 0.68 (95 % CI from 0.58 to 0.78). The fifth and 95th percentiles of the positive DBPCFC predictive probability distribution were 17 and 73 % (17 and 59 % after correction for over-optimism). We conclude that a diagnostic model with three clinical parameters may be used for better referral of children suspected of CMA and the decision to either initially perform an open food challenge or directly perform a DBPCFC. Large prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and provide additional precision.","van Thuijl, A. and Schoemaker, A.

2072,Follow-up of selective eaters from childhood to adulthood,"Objective The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and course of selective eating, the stability of its behavioral profile over time, and the presence of eating disorder psychopathology among selective eaters in a non-treatment seeking cohort of young adults followed longitudinally from birth to age 23. Method A prospective design tracking a subset of the original participants from the Stanford Infant Growth Study (n¬†=¬†216) who had been followed since birth. At age 11, 120 participants had completed all assessments. The current study included a subset of the original participants who, at age 11, had completed all assessments (n¬†=¬†120) and, at age 23, had current contact information available (n¬†=¬†62) and agreed to participate (n¬†=¬†61). Results Of the 61 young adults, 17 (28%) were identified as selective eaters at age 23. The selective eating-related behaviors reported during adulthood were similar to those endorsed during childhood. New onset selective eating cases were reported during adolescence or young adulthood by 35% of the selective eating sample. Participants who were selective eaters for >¬†6¬†years prior to age 11 remained selective at age 23. There was no evidence of increased eating disorder psychopathology, excessive thinness, or obesity in selective eaters compared with non-selective eaters.

2074,Practical algorithms for managing common gastrointestinal symptoms in infants,"Objective: In early infancy, various gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., constipation, regurgitation, crying/fussiness, infantile colic, and excessive gas) are common problems and may result in numerous visits to pediatricians. Worldwide, this often results in switching infant formulas because parents (and sometimes doctors) believe these symptoms reflect a formula intolerance. However, in many cases, these infants are growing and developing normally. This study was performed to offer family pediatricians consensus-based algorithms on the management of the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in infants. Methods: A group of pediatric gastroenterologists and pediatric allergists from Europe, USA, Latin America, and Asia developed guidelines and practical algorithms to assist general pediatricians in addressing this challenge. Results: Five such practice recommendations were developed after a thorough literature review. These algorithms should not be considered as an ""evidence-based guideline""","Vandenplas, Y. and Gutierrez-Castrellon, P. and Velasco-Benitez, C. and Palacios, J. and Jaen, D. and Ribeiro, H. and Lynette Shek, P.

2075,Randomised controlled trial demonstrates that fermented infant formula with short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides reduces the incidence of infantile colic,"AIM: We examined the effects on gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance of a novel infant formula that combined specific fermented formula (FERM) with short-chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scGOS/lcFOS), with a 9:1 ratio and concentration of 0.8 g/100 mL. METHODS: This prospective, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial comprised 432 healthy, term infants aged 0-28 days whose parents decided to not start, or discontinued, breastfeeding. Infant formula with scGOS/lcFOS+50%FERM, scGOS/lcFOS+15%FERM, 50%FERM and scGOS/lcFOS were tested. Parents completed standardised seven-day diaries on GI symptoms, crying, sleeping and stool characteristics each month until the infants were 17 weeks. RESULTS: All the formulas were well tolerated. At four weeks, the overall incidence of infantile colic was significantly lower (8%) with scGOS/lcFOS+50%FERM than scGOS/lcFOS (20%, p = 0.034) or 50%FERM (20%, p = 0.036). Longitudinal modelling showed that scGOS/lcFOS+50%FERM-fed infants also displayed a persistently lower daily crying duration and showed a consistent stool-softening effect than infants who received formula without scGOS/lcFOS. CONCLUSION: The combination of fermented formula with scGOS/lcFOS was well tolerated and showed a lower overall crying time, a lower incidence of infantile colic and a stool-softening effect in healthy term infants. These findings suggest for the first time that a specific infant formula has a preventive effect on infantile colic in formula-fed infants.","Vandenplas, Y. and Ludwig, T. and Bouritius, H. and Alliet, P. and Forde, D. and Peeters, S. and Huet, F. and Hourihane, J.",1,1658

2077,The melody of crying,"As the speech of a normal hearing and a deaf person are different, author expects differences between the crying sound of normal hearing and hard-of-hearing infants as well. In this study the author determined by computerized algorithms the melody of 2762 crying sounds from 316 infants, and compared the results between infants with hearing disorders and normal hearing. The analysis of the crying sounds is aimed to work out a new, cheaper hearing screening method, which would give a new potential to the early detection of hearing disorders. All the applied steps were developed by automatic, computer-executed methods providing reproducible, objective results in contradistinction to some previous studies, which had applied manual methods and reached subjective results. Several possible ways for digital signal processing of the infant cry are discussed. A novel melody shape classification system was created to obtain a more precise distribution of the melodies by their shapes. The system determined 77 different categories, where the first 20 categories covered the 95% of the melodies. The applied methods were created and tested in a huge number of melodies.","V√°rallyay, G., Jr.",0,1660
2078,Melody shape: a suggested novel attribute for the biomedical analysis of the infant cry,"The biomedical analysis of the infant cry is aimed to find connections between several diseases during infancy and their influence on the human sound production system. A new, non-invasive diagnostic tool could be created, if these connections were fully discovered. Various reports have already dealt with the analysis of the crying sound for physiological, psychic, physical, developmental, etc. reasons. In these studies characteristic attributes of the infant cry were obtained and analyzed. In the time domain mostly absolute and normalized durations, in the frequency domain frequency components, intervals were determined. The melody of crying was analyzed occasionally as there were no exact methods for categorizing the shapes of the melodies. In this paper the authors introduce a new system for categorizing the melodies. By this system the analysis of the melodies can be evaluated in an easy and objective way that it could be included in further biomedical researches dealing with the infant cry.","Varallyay, G., Jr. and Beny√≥, Z.",0,1661

2083,Resuscitation with room air instead of 100% oxygen prevents oxidative stress in moderately asphyxiated term neonates,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, asphyxiated newborn infants have been ventilated using 100% oxygen. However, a recent multinational trial has shown that the use of room air was just as efficient as pure oxygen in securing the survival of severely asphyxiated newborn infants. Oxidative stress markers in moderately asphyxiated term newborn infants resuscitated with either 100% oxygen or room air have been studied for the first time in this work. METHODS: Eligible term neonates with perinatal asphyxia were randomly resuscitated with either room air or 100% oxygen. The clinical parameters recorded were those of the Apgar score at 1, 5, and 10 minutes, the time of onset of the first cry, and the time of onset of the sustained pattern of respiration. In addition, reduced and oxidized glutathione concentrations and antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) were determined in blood from the umbilical artery during delivery and in peripheral blood at 72 hours and at 4 weeks' postnatal age. RESULTS: Our results show that the room-air resuscitated (RAR) group needed significantly less time to first cry than the group resuscitated with 100% oxygen (1.2 +/- 0.6 minutes vs 1.7 +/- 0.5). Moreover, the RAR group needed less time undergoing ventilation to achieve a sustained respiratory pattern than the group resuscitated with pure oxygen (4.6 +/- 0.7 vs 7.5 +/- 1.8 minutes). The reduced-to-oxidized-glutathione ratio, which is an accurate index of oxidative stress, of the RAR group (53 +/- 9) at 28 days of postnatal life showed no differences with the control nonasphyxiated group (50 +/- 12). However, the reduced-to-oxidized-glutathione ratio of the 100% oxygen-resuscitated group (OxR) (15 +/- 5) was significantly lower and revealed protracted oxidative stress. Furthermore, the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase in erythrocytes were 69% and 78% higher, respectively, in the OxR group than in the control group at 28 days of postnatal life. Thus, this shows that these antioxidant enzymes, although higher than in controls, could not cope with the ongoing generation of free radicals in the OxR group. However, there were no differences in antioxidant enzyme activities between the RAR group and the control group at this stage. CONCLUSIONS: There are no apparent clinical disadvantages in using room air for ventilation of asphyxiated neonates rather than 100% oxygen. Furthermore, RAR infants recover more quickly as assessed by Apgar scores, time to the first cry, and the sustained pattern of respiration. In addition, neonates resuscitated with 100% oxygen exhibit biochemical findings reflecting prolonged oxidative stress present even after 4 weeks of postnatal life, which do not appear in the RAR group. Thus, the current accepted recommendations for using 100% oxygen in the resuscitation of asphyxiated newborn infants should be further discussed and investigated.","Vento, M. and Asensi, M. and Sastre, J. and Garc√≠a-Sala, F. and Pallard√≥, F.

2088,CHARGE syndrome: Relations between behavioral characteristics and medical conditions,"The behaviors and medical problems in 27 persons with CHARGE syndrome were studied, because it was hypothesized that their behavior might be partly dependent on the heterogeneous medical status. With the exception of more tics, cardiac surgery was associated with positive behaviors: less withdrawn behavior, better mood, and a more easy temperament. Tube feeding was also related to positive behavior, since participants with a history of tube feeding showed less intense behavior. Cerebral deficits were associated with three problem behaviors: more intense and withdrawn behavior and a worse mood. Deafblindness was associated with developmental delays in expressive and overall communication level, and recurrent middle ear infections correlated with delays in written language. Of all medical conditions, only the presence or absence of heart defects and cardiac surgery could differentiate between the participants with regard to the number of behavioral problems. Participants with heart surgery especially, had less behavior problems. The number of operations and hospitalizations was not associated with behavior, but the total length of the hospitalizations was. Long hospital stays were associated with less problem behavior, especially internalizing behaviors. Cerebral and heart problems did not result in longer hospital stays, whereas esophageal reflux did. Age effects were reflected in older participants, who showed more internalizing problems. Heart surgery and hospitalization may be protective factors, but the protection might not be the actual surgery or hospital stay, as there may be other variables that are the actual cause, such as reduced vitality or altered parent child interactions after heart surgery.

2089,"Pacifier use and short breastfeeding duration: cause, consequence, or coincidence?","OBJECTIVES: Pacifiers are related to a shorter duration of breastfeeding. However, it is unclear whether this association is causal, because confounding, reverse causality, and self-selection of mothers may play a role. These issues were investigated through a combination of epidemiologic and ethnographic research in southern Brazil. METHODOLOGY: A population-based cohort of 650 mothers and infants were visited shortly after delivery and at 1, 3, and 6 months. The rate of complete follow-up was 96.8%. A subsample of 80 mothers and infants was selected for the ethnographic study, which included in-depth interviews and participant observations in the age range of 2 to 6 months with a mean of 4.5 visits. RESULTS: The epidemiologic study showed that pacifier use was common with 85% of users at 1 month. However, this was a dynamic process, with many infants starting or abandoning the pacifiers in any age range. Children who stopped breastfeeding in a given period were likely to take up the pacifier during that period. Further analyses excluded all infants not breastfed at 1 month of age and those who reportedly had breastfeeding problems, leaving 450 infants with full data. Intense pacifier users at 1 month (children who used the pacifiers during most of the day and at least until falling asleep) were four times more likely to stop breastfeeding by 6 months of age than nonusers. Users also had fewer daily breastfeedings than nonusers. After adjustment for several confounding variables, logistic regression showed that pacifier use was still associated with an odds ratio of 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.40 to 4.01) for stopping breastfeeding. The ethnographic analysis showed that pacifier use was widely regarded as a positive behavior and that mothers often strongly stimulated the infants to accept it. Although few mothers openly admitted that pacifiers might shorten breastfeeding, a considerable group effectively used pacifiers to get their infants off the breast or to increase the interval between feedings. The latter also had rigid breastfeeding styles that increased maternal-infant distance, had important concerns about objective aspects of infant growth and development, and were highly sensitive to infant crying. These behaviors were linked to intense comparison between themselves and other mothers and to a lack of self-confidence. Nonwhite mothers, those who delivered vaginally, and mothers of infant girls seemed to be more confident and less affected by these difficulties. The epidemiologic analysis confirmed that pacifier use was more closely associated with breastfeeding duration among nonwhite mothers and for normally delivered infants. CONCLUSIONS: Pacifiers may be an effective weaning mechanism used by mothers who have explicit or implicit difficulties in breastfeeding, but they are much less likely to affect infants whose mothers are confident about nursing. Breastfeeding promotion campaigns aimed specifically at reducing pacifier use will fail unless they also help women face the challenges of nursing and address their anxieties. The combination of epidemiologic and ethnographic methods was essential for understanding the complex relations between pacifier use and breastfeeding.","Victora, C. G. and Behague, D.

2091,Survey on the Adherence to the 2009 NASPGHAN-ESPGHAN Gastroesophageal Reflux Guidelines by Brazilian Paediatricians,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the management of gastroesophageal reflux in children among Brazilian pediatricians and adherence to the 2009 North American Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN), and European Society of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) Guideline in Brazil. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted, applying a standard questionnaire with 12 questions about gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) management in infants, children, and adolescents to the pediatricians during the 37th Brazilian Pediatrics Congress in October, 2015. Adherence to the 2009 NASPGHAN-ESPGHAN Guideline was verified through analyses of interviewees' answers. Pediatricians' demographic and professional characteristics were screened. RESULTS: A total of 390 Brazilian pediatricians answered the questionnaire. None showed complete adherence to Guideline recommendations. GERD diagnosis by history alone was reported by 67%, irrespective of the child's age. The mean score for diagnostic adherence to the guidelines was 0.94‚Ää¬±‚Ää0.86 (range 0-4). Working in public health services (P‚Ää=‚Ää0.026) was the only variable retained as a significant predictor of poor adherence for GER/GERD diagnosis after multivariate logistic regression analysis. No significant statistical differences were found between Brazilian regions on total score (P‚Ää=‚Ää0.774). Proton pump inhibitors were prescribed by 28.4% of the pediatricians independent of child's age, and 59% use proton pump inhibitors to treat babies with unexplained crying and/or distressed behavior. CONCLUSIONS: 2009 NASPGHAN-ESPGHAN Guideline recommendations had poor adherence by Brazilian pediatricians.

Children were allocated randomly to receive thiopental 5 mg kg-1 (group TH), alfentanil 10 micrograms kg-1 and propofol 3 mg kg-1 (group PAH) or 5% halothane (group HH) for induction of anaesthesia. In group TH, tracheal intubation was facilitated with succinylcholine (suxamethonium) 1.5 mg kg-1. In groups PAH and HH, tracheal intubation was performed without neuromuscular block, and succinylcholine was used only if required. Anaesthesia was maintained with 1-3% halothane during spontaneous respiration. Times to achieving predetermined recovery end-points were recorded. Quality of recovery was assessed using a score of 1-9 (best to worst) for sedation, crying, restlessness and agitation. A postoperative questionnaire was used to determine the well-being of the child at home, 24 h after operation. Emergence from anaesthesia (response to non-painful stimuli) occurred earlier in group HH (mean 9 (SD 6) min) than in groups PAH (13 (6) min, P < 0.01) and TH (18 (14) min, P < 0.01). Sitting up, walking and home readiness were achieved earlier in groups PAH and HH than in group TH (P < 0.05 for each variable). Children in group TH were more sedated during the first 30 min after anaesthesia than those in the two other groups (P < 0.05) while emergence-related delirium was more common in group HH than in group TH (P < 0.01). Well-being at home was similar in all groups. We conclude that induction of halothane anaesthesia with propofol-alfentanil or halothane provided more rapid recovery and earlier discharge than that with thiopental.","Viitanen, H. and Annila, P. and Rorarius, M. and Paloheimo, M. and Baer, G.",0,1669
2093,Implications for probiotic use in healthy children,"The gut microbiota is an isolated organ system [1], which impacts the host through various mechanisms. Given the potential magnitude by which the gut microbiota is capable of impacting host health, alteration of its composition in favour of a healthcompatible gut microbiota composition (eubiotic state [2]) and more specifically its metabolome, may provide a means to maintain host health. Diet is one modifiable factor through which gut microbes can be altered. Providing beneficial microbes through diet as a probiotic, defined as live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host‚Äù [3, 4], may impart gut microbial eubiosis and desired host health. Many probiotic bacteria have been isolated from food, intestinal contents/feces of humans and animals, and the human urogenital tract, oral cavity, and milk [5, 6]. However, it is critical that probiotics provided for consumption in children are screened for long-term tolerance and safety. Commercially available probiotics typically include bacteria, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria genera, and yeasts (Saccharomyces genus), which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS). For example, Bifidobacterium lactis in combination with Streptococcus thermophilus, provided to healthy infants aged 3-24 months given 2.4 √ó 109 colony forming units/day over a period of 18 months did not display any potential side effects [7]. Subsequent to being granted GRAS status, probiotics may be recommended for the prevention of several diseases and disorders in healthy children associated with an altered microbial ecology including allergies, respiratory tract infections, colic and common cold. Stimulation of non-specific immunity or humoral and cellular immunity may be one mechanism by which probiotics elicit their protective effects [8], although several other mechanisms have been proposed. However, the associated benefit of utilizing probiotics cannot be extrapolated to all disease types. While general benefits can be ascribed to all probiotics, the ability for the probiotic to elicit a given beneficial effect depends specifically on the bacterial strain and specific disease it was meant to mitigate. Furthermore, determining the specific dosage, matrix, mode of delivery, length of treatment, and timing of exposure for different probiotic preparations is essential in ensuring expected effect and health maintenance [9]. Furthermore, it has become clear that breast-milk is a source for beneficial bacteria and necessary for the initial establishment of the gut microbiota composition and maturation of the newborn immune system [10]. Therefore, providing probiotics to the mother or directly to the infant during early life may provide invaluable advantages for the child in terms of sustaining health in adulthood. Thus, for the purposes of this chapter, the focus will be on the implications of probiotic use in healthy children. ¬© 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Villa, C. R. and Comelli, E. M.",0,1670
2095,Infant assessment,"Infancy is one of the most fascinating periods in the human life cycle. In two short years, infants become thinking, speaking, social beings. As this book explains, over the past three decades, researchers and clinicians have developed an array of assessment methods for measuring infant development and diagnosing infants with developmental delays.The field of infant assessment has broadened from a major focus on cognitive development to an emphasis on parent-infant interaction, play assessment, and newer strategies that involve naturalistic observations. Because of the need to look at the whole infant, assessment often involves multiple disciplines. The interdisciplinary approach measures the infant domains of motor skills, cognitive abilities, and language acquisition and evaluates the infant‚Äôs psychosocial environment.The chapters in this volume provide a solid overview of the current trends in infant assessment measures and procedures. The book can be used in undergraduate and graduate infant development courses and for advanced courses in infant assessment. ¬© 1997 Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.","Virginia Wyly, M.",0,1671
2097,Tolerance and safety of Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei in combination with Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis in a prebiotic-containing infant formula: a randomised controlled trial,"The addition of probiotics to infant formula has been shown to be an efficient way to increase the number of beneficial bacteria in the intestine in order to promote a gut flora resembling that of breast-fed infants. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the safety and tolerance of a combination of two probiotic strains in early infancy. A group of 126 newborns were randomised to receive a prebiotic-containing starter formula supplemented with Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis or the same formula without probiotics for the first 3 months of life. A total of eighty infants continued the study until they were aged 6 months. Growth measurements were taken monthly at healthy baby clinics. Diaries were used to monitor behaviour, infections, use of antibiotics, as well as stool characteristics. Normal growth occurred in all infants and no statistically significant differences were detected between the probiotics group and the control group for gain in weight, length and head circumference. Infants in the probiotics group produced softer and more frequent stools during the first 3 months of life. No differences were found in crying and sleeping hours, number of parent-diagnosed infections, antibiotic use, visits to the general practitioner and number of adverse events. The use of a prebiotic-containing starter formula supplemented with L. paracasei ssp. paracasei and B. animalis ssp. lactis in early infancy is safe, well tolerated and has no adverse effects on growth and infant behaviour.","Vlieger, A.

2098,New approaches to assessing the risks of hyperbilirubinemia,"The issue of what is a critical threshold of bilirubin for the neonate in terms of long-term morbidity, however, remains unanswered. The recent large prospective study carried out in the Netherlands by Van de Bor et al. to evaluate the effect of bilirubin on 2-year neurodevelopmental outcome of premature infants with a birthweight less than 1500 gm identified a consistent increase in handicap rate for each 2.9 mg/dl (50 microns mol/L) increase in maximum bilirubin concentration. The percentage of children with both minor and major handicaps increased consistently with increased bilirubin concentration. Logistic regression analysis with the maximum serum bilirubin concentration as the continuous variable and controlling for seven other risk factors identified an odds ratio for handicap of 1.3 with a 95% confidence interval between 1.03 and 1.62, (P less than 0.02). These data suggest that a relationship exists between mild and moderate levels of bilirubin and neurodevelopmental handicap at 2 years of age in premature infants. Van de Bor's study is important because it suggests that we must continue to investigate the risk of low to moderate levels of bilirubin in both premature and full-term infants. The study of neonatal alterations of behavior, BAER conduction time, and cry characteristics in infants with hyperbilirubinemia lends support to the hypothesis that low levels of bilirubin result in neonatal neurobehavioral changes that can be easily measured and recorded by these techniques. BAER changes are mediated by the eighth cranial nerve pathway, and cry characteristics are mediated by the vagal complex cranial nerves. The nuclei of these cranial nerves are located in close proximity to one another in the brainstem, and therefore the insult imposed by bilirubin is reflected not only in changes of these two parameters but by behavioral manifestations (i.e., specifically orientation). Finally, however, evidence exists that reversals of these measured changes do occur after treatment modalities such as exchange transfusion or phototherapy are used. The question of a safe level of bilirubin concentration, and safe duration of exposure relative to long-term minor or soft neurodevelopmental handicaps remains unanswered. Large, controlled, prospective, epidemiologic studies are needed to provide these answers.","Vohr, B. R.",0,1673

This pilot study evaluated the utility of administering parent-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to explore these factors in Filipino infants and examined the relationships between these factors and infant sex, formula intake and weight, over time. Methods: Forty healthy, 4-week-old, formula-fed infants (n=20 males) were enrolled in this 6-week, prospective, uncontrolled study during which infants were exclusively fed a standard term infant formula enriched with alpha-lactalbumin. On Day-1 and 42, anthropometrics were measured and mothers completed a 97-item measure of HRQoL [Infant Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire (ITQOL)] covering 6 infant-focused and 3 parent-focused concepts and a 24-item measure of infant temperament [Infant Characteristics Questionnaire (ICQ)]. At Day-42, mothers also completed an 18-item measure of infant appetite [Baby Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (BEBQ)]. A 3-day formula intake diary was completed before Day-42.

A 9-year prospective sibling control study,"The goal of this study is to examine the extent to which child temperament predicts the adiposity rebound, a steep increase in the body mass index (BMI) between ages 5 and 7 years. If this increase occurs at an earlier age, the risk for later obesity is elevated. To improve the accuracy of the examination, we use a genetically informed design, a sibling-control study, to control for genetic and familial confounding. We hypothesize that temperament traits tapping negative emotionality, approach and avoidance are associated with the adiposity rebound. ¬© 2018 Vollrath et al.","Vollrath, M. E. and Hampson, S.

2103,Bisphenol A: How the most relevant exposure sources contribute to total consumer exposure,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupting chemical that is found in human urine throughout industrial societies around the globe. Consumer exposure pathways to BPA include packaged food, household dust, air, and dental fillings. To date, information on the relative contribution of the different pathways to total consumer exposure is lacking, but is key for managing substance-associated risks. We investigated the relative contributions of the pathways known to be most relevant for nine different consumer groups. Our results suggest that the most important pathways for infants and children are the use of polycarbonate (PC) baby bottles and for adults and teenagers the consumption of canned food. Dental surgery can also considerably contribute over a short time directly after the surgery. For infants fed with PC baby bottles with mean dose rates of 0.8 Œºg/kgbw/d the highest exposure dose rate was calculated. This dose rate is far below the tolerable daily intake of 50 Œºg/kgbw/d. However, it is of the same order of magnitude as recently reported concentrations that caused low-dose health effects in rodents. We find a pattern of falling exposure levels with rising age that is supported by urinary concentrations of BPA available for selected consumer groups. Similarly, the exposure levels we predict are confirmed by the levels reported in these studies. ¬© 2010 Society for Risk Analysis.","Von Goetz, N. and Wormuth, M. and Scheringer, M. and Hungerb√ºhler, K.",0,1677

2105,Postoperative pain during the first week after adenoidectomy and guillotine adenotonsillectomy in children,"BACKGROUND: Adenoidectomy (AD) and adenotonsillectomy (ATE) are frequently occurring and often painful interventions in children. In literature, it is very prevalent that postoperative pain in children following ATE is hard to control. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and severity of postoperative pain in children undergoing AD and ATE in the ambulatory setting. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed including 167 children aged 0-12 years, undergoing AD using an adenotome and ATE using the guillotine technique in day care. Children undergoing AD received acetaminophen pre- and postoperatively. Children undergoing ATE received acetaminophen and diclofenac preoperatively, sufentanyl postoperative and a prescription of around-the-clock treatment with acetaminophen and diclofenac at home. Pain intensity and analgesic consumption were recorded in hospital using the Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability-scale (FLACC), as well as during a 1-week follow-up period at home using the Parents' Postoperative Pain Measure (PPPM) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores. RESULTS: All children left the recovery room with adequate pain scores and were discharged with a median VAS of two after ATE and one after AD. The PPPM and VAS scores were highest at the first measurement at home for AD patients (VAS = 2.0 and PPPM = 1.5) and ATE patients (VAS = 4.5 and PPPM = 9). On the second postoperative day, AD patients scored 0.0 points on both VAS and PPPM. ATE patients scored at that time 3.0 point on the VAS and 6.0 points using the PPPM. Despite high adherence to pain treatment, daytime activities normalized after an average of 2 and 7 days after AD and ATE, respectively. CONCLUSION: Examination of the PPPM and VAS scores illustrated that children undergoing AD were comfortable with acetaminophen as a single analgesic, whereas children undergoing ATE experience significant pain for up to two postoperative days when treated with acetaminophen and diclofenac.","Vons, K.

2110,Infant temperament and subject loss in a habituation procedure,"Tested the hypothesis that infants who complete an experimental procedure might be those who are more likely to be described as adaptable or soothable, while unsuccessful infants are more likely to be described as difficult or fussy. 57 female and 57 male infants at 3 age levels (11, 18, and 28 wks) were rated by their mothers on a temperament questionnaire and then subjected to a habituation procedure. Analyses showed that females who were unable to complete the habituation task were reported as being more fussy and unadaptable. They were also less likely to complete at least part of the procedure than were males. Findings suggest that S loss in habituation studies may be the result of nonrandom individual difference factors and not just the result of temporary fluctuations in state.

Method: This phenomenologic qualitative study used a focus group design and semi-structured interview format. Participants were seven low-income women with a child enrolled in an urban day care facility, which provided the setting for data collection. Results: Analyses of the data revealed three themes: (a) activities done to pacify the infant, (b) coping mechanism, and (c) social support available. Discussion: The results of this study indicate that activities (a) may include the infant, such as holding and singing, or (b) may be directed toward the mother, such as using headphones or leaving the room. These activities follow the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics and are not unique. Social support primarily was provided at the day care facility, supplemented with personal relationships that are tentative.

2112,Teaching children to like and eat vegetables,"Higher vegetable intake has been related to lower risks of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, several cancers and obesity. Yet children consume fewer than the recommended servings of fruits and vegetables set forth by the USDA. Exposure to vegetables has successfully improved children's liking for and consumption of vegetables particularly for children younger than two years. In contrast, associative conditioning seems necessary for older children, especially with bitter vegetables. We review studies using both exposure and associative conditioning to teach children to like vegetables, including flavor-flavor learning and flavor-calorie learning. Recognizing these different processes helps reconcile discrepant literature and may provide techniques for increasing preferences for vegetables in children. Associative conditioning and exposure can be used by parents and others to enhance children's liking for and consumption of vegetables. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Wadhera, D. and Capaldi Phillips, E.

2113,Analysis of breathing patterns in a prospective population of term infants does not predict susceptibility to sudden infant death syndrome,"Oscillatory patterns in ventilation have been seen in term and premature infants and are indicative of the stability of the respiratory blood gas feedback control system. Apneas are related to these patterns and apnea duration is correlated with pattern characteristics. In our study breathing patterns were analyzed in recordings from 10 term infants who subsequently died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and 10 control infants matched for birth wt, gestational age, and postnatal age. Subjects were drawn from a prospectively studied population of 9856 infants. Breath-by-breath minute ventilation was estimated in each of these 24-h recordings and oscillatory patterns were detected using a comb of digital bandpass filters. Confidence limits on the filter output and a bad data flag for rejection of data during gross body movements or crying insured that only significant patterns in ventilation were evaluated. Pattern prevalence and amplitude were compared in three frequency regimes: 6- to 87-s cycle times, 6- to 28-s cycle times, and 28- to 87-s cycle times. There was no significant difference between the SIDS and the control infants in any of these pattern comparisons (paired t and Wilcoxon paired rank sum tests, p less than 0.05). In light of the normal breathing patterns found in the SIDS infants, it is unlikely that susceptibility to SIDS is distinguished, at the time of these recordings, by instability of the respiratory blood gas feedback control system.","Waggener, T.

As expected most time was spent asleep, with a mean of 16.2 h at 1 week and 15.5 h at 8 weeks. Most sleeping occurred between midnight and 4 a.m. even by week 1 and there was a progressive fall in the average duration of feeding during that time interval over the 8 week period. Fussing and crying were mostly noted between 4 and 8 p.m. with an additional peak between 8 a.m. and noon, the latter disappearing by week 4.

The hip was the most commonly affected joint with the knee taking second place. Ten cases (55%) demonstrated concomitant osteomyelitis. A bacterial etiology was established in 16 cases (88%). The predominant pathogens were S. aureus (5 cases) followed by group B streptococcus (4 cases). Total parenteral nutrition was the predisposing factor of infection in 4 of the 5 S. aureus arthritis cases. The duration of treatment ranged from 21 to 44 days. Two patients developed sequelae: namely discrepancies in leg length, and a limping gait.

The present study aimed to investigate the factors associated with early introduction of complementary feeding (i.e., before age 4 months), and factors associated with infants consumption of non-recommended foods, including sweet beverages and snack foods. Methods: This study used cross-sectional data from the BeeBOFT study (n = 2157). Data on complementary feeding practices and potential determinants were obtained by questionnaire at infant's age of 6 months. Logistic regression models were used to investigate factors associated with early introduction of complementary feeding and infants' consumption of non-recommended foods. Results: 21.4% of infants had received complementary feeding before 4 months of age. At the age of 6 months, 20.2% of all infants were consuming sweet beverages daily and 16.5% were consuming snack foods daily. Younger maternal age, lower maternal educational level, absence or shorter duration of breastfeeding, parental conviction that ""my child always wants to eat when he/she sees someone eating"" and not attending day-care were independently associated with both early introduction of complementary feeding and the consumption of non-recommended foods. Higher maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and infant postnatal weight gain were associated only with early introduction of complementary feeding. Conclusions: We identified several demographical, biological, behavioral, psychosocial, and social factors associated with inappropriate complementary feeding practices.

Dependent variables were measured by means of five structured questionnaires. Results: Postnatally depressed mothers reported significantly higher perceived stress, but lower social support and self-esteem than nondepressed mothers at 1 year after childbirth. The participants' postpartum depression had no significant effect on their infants' eight developmental areas, nor did depression influence their plans about the number of children to have in the future. Conclusions: Postpartum depression may have a negative influence on the psychosocial health of women, but it does not appear to influence the overall development of their infants and their family planning.","Wang, S.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in 48 patients with convulsions between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2009. RESULTS: The age of onset of gastroenteritis was between 13 months and 24 months in 34 patients (70.83%). The episodes occurred at a distinct autumn/winter peak (75%). The seizures mostly occurred within the first 5 days of gastroenteritis, especially within the first 3 days, peaking on day 2 (39.58%). Thirty-five patients (72.92%) had clustered seizures in their episodes. Most episodes were symmetric, generalized tonic-clonic (83.33%) and brief (93.75%). The seizures were induced by pain and/or crying in 19 (39.58%) patients. Stool culture was positive for rotavirus in 21 (53.85%) of the 39 patients. Twenty patients (20/41, 48.78%) still had clustered seizures after the administration of a single anticonvulsant. The seizures persisted even after the administration of two combined anticonvulsants in 5 (26.32%) of 19 episodes. All patients exhibited normal psychomotor development. CONCLUSIONS: Benign convulsions with mild gastroenteritis are not rare in China, and rotavirus infection is a major cause.","Wang, Y. F. and Zhou, Z. S.",0,1693
2124,"The efficacy of moderate-to-high dose oral prednisolone versus low-to-moderate dose intramuscular corticotropin for improvement of hypsarrhythmia in West syndrome: a randomized, single-blind, parallel clinical trial","BACKGROUND: The role of therapy on improvement of hypsarrhythmia has not been systematically assessed. This study was performed to assess the efficacy of oral prednisolone and intramuscular adrenocorticotrophin hormone in improving hypsarrhythmia in West syndrome. METHOD: Children (2 months-2 years), with previously untreated West syndrome, were randomized to receive 40-60 IU every other day of intramuscular adrenocorticotrophin hormone or 40-60 mg/day of oral prednisolone for 14 days. Children with tuberous sclerosis were excluded. Improvement of hypsarrhythmia was assessed blindly using a hypsarrhythmia severity scale before and after completion of therapy. Adverse effects were assessed on day 14 using symptom diary. (Clinical trial registry identifier: SLCTR/2010/010.) RESULTS: From 92 newly diagnosed West syndrome infants, 48 were randomized to receive prednisolone and 44 to receive adrenocorticotrophin hormone. Eighty infants completed the posttreatment evaluation according to specifications.

2127,Maternal depressive symptoms and child sleep: Models of mutual influence over time,"The aim of the research was to test hypotheses concerning the associations between maternal depressive symptoms and child sleep using longitudinal data to examine possible predictive pathways. Data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care with 1222 children studied from 1 to 36 months of age were analyzed to examine: effects on trajectories over time, and phase-specific effects over three defined age periods (6 to 15, 15 to 24, and 24 to 36 months). Child sleep was found to influence maternal depressive symptoms only for the 15- to 24-month age period, where, contrary to expectation, longer duration of child awakenings predicted decreased maternal depressive symptoms. Maternal depressive symptoms were found to predict an increased frequency of child awakenings across the 15- to 24-month age period only. In contrast, maternal depressive symptoms were found to significantly predict increased duration of child awakenings both for the 3-year trajectory and across the 15- to 24- and 24- to 36-month age periods. Additional research is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which maternal depressive symptoms predict increased duration of child awakenings.

2130,Who's feeding baby? Non-maternal involvement in feeding and its association with dietary intakes among infants and toddlers,"This study examined non-maternal involvement in feeding during the first 2. years of life and its association with breastfeeding duration, early introduction of complementary foods, and dietary intakes of selected foods and beverages. Data were from the Infant Care, Feeding and Risk of Obesity Study, a cohort of 217 low-income, African-American mother-infant dyads, followed from 3 to 18. months postpartum. Non-maternal caregivers (NMCs) were defined as persons involved in feeding an infant/toddler 50% or more of the total daily feedings. Use of any NMC and the type of NMC was tabulated for each study visit (3, 6, 9, 12, and 18. months). At each time point, more than half of all households reported a NMC. Fathers, grandmothers, and licensed childcare providers were the most common types of NMCs. In longitudinal models adjusted for confounding variables, NMC use was associated with a decreased likelihood of continued breastfeeding, and an increased likelihood of infants and toddlers consuming juice or whole fruit. Given the high prevalence of non-maternal involvement in feeding, interventions targeting multiple family members are warranted as they are likely to be more effective than those targeting the mother alone. ¬© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Wasser, H.

2131,Family-based obesity prevention for infants: Design of the ‚ÄúMothers & Others‚Äù randomized trial,"Objective Our goal is to test the efficacy of a family-based, multi-component intervention focused on infants of African-American (AA) mothers and families, a minority population at elevated risk for pediatric obesity, versus a child safety attention-control group to promote healthy weight gain patterns during the first two years of life. Design, participants, and methods The design is a two-group randomized controlled trial among 468 AA pregnant women in central North Carolina. Mothers and study partners in the intervention group receive anticipatory guidance on breastfeeding, responsive feeding, use of non-food soothing techniques for infant crying, appropriate timing and quality of complementary feeding, age-appropriate infant sleep, and minimization of TV/media. The primary delivery channel is 6 home visits by a peer educator, 4 interim newsletters and twice-weekly text messaging. Intervention families also receive 2 home visits from an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant. Assessments occur at 28 and 37 weeks gestation and when infants are 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months of age. Results The primary outcome is infant/toddler growth and likelihood of overweight at 15 months. Differences between groups are expected to be achieved through uptake of the targeted infant feeding and care behaviors (secondary outcomes) and change in caregivers' modifiable risk factors (mediators) underpinning the intervention. Conclusions If successful in promoting healthy infant growth and enhancing caregiver behaviors, ‚ÄúMothers and Others‚Äù will have high public health relevance for future obesity-prevention efforts aimed at children younger than 2 years, including interventional research and federal, state, and community health programs.

2139,"Links between Shared Reading and Play, Parent Psychosocial Functioning, and Child Behavior: Evidence from a Randomized Controlled Trial","Objective: To investigate pathways by which interventions that promote shared reading and play help prevent child behavior problems. We examined whether family processes associated with the family investment pathway (eg, parental cognitive stimulation) and the family stress pathway (eg, mothers' psychosocial functioning) mediated impacts of a pediatric-based preventive intervention on child behavior. Study design: The sample included 362 low-income mothers and their children who participated in a randomized controlled trial of the Video Interaction Project, a pediatrics-based preventive intervention that promotes parent-child interactions in the context of shared reading and play. Parent-child dyads were randomly assigned to group at birth. Three mediators‚Äîparental cognitive stimulation, maternal stress about the parent-child relationship, and maternal depressive symptoms‚Äîwere assessed at child ages 6 and 36 months. The outcome, child externalizing behaviors, was assessed at 36 months. We used a series of path analytic models to examine how these family processes, separately or together, mediated the impacts of the Video Interaction Project on child behavioral outcomes. Results: Intervention impacts on child behavior were mediated by enhancements in cognitive stimulation and by improvements in mothers' psychosocial functioning. A sequential mediation model showed that Video Interaction Project impacts on cognitive stimulation at 6 months were associated with later decreases in mothers' stress about the parent-child relationship and that this pathway mediated intervention impacts on child behavioral outcomes at 3 years of age (P =.023). Conclusions: Using an experimental design, this study identifies pathways by which parent-child interactions in shared reading and play can improve child behavioral outcomes.

2140,The contribution of fetal drug exposure to temperament: Potential teratogenic effects on neuropsychiatric risk,"Background: Preliminary evidence indicates that fetal drug exposure may be associated with alterations in temperament. However, studies often do not dissociate the potential effects of drug exposure from other perinatal or environmental factors that could influence temperament phenotypes. Methods: High risk children (n = 120) were followed from birth to 6 months of age to determine the effects of fetal drug exposure on temperament, after controlling for the child's gender, gestational age, medical morbidity, ethnicity, and maltreatment as well as the mother's stress, income adequacy, and quality of caregiving. Methods included medical chart review, questionnaires, and videotapes of mother-child interaction. Results: Preliminary analyses indicated that fetal drug exposure was associated with both distractibility and intensity of children's responses to the environment at 6 months of age. After adjusting for potentially confounding variables, drug exposure accounted for 12% of the variance in distractibility but was not a significant predictor in the regression model for intensity. Conclusions: Findings suggest that drug-exposed children may experience difficulty sustaining their focus of attention and be more easily distracted by environmental stimuli than non-drug-exposed children. Results converge with previous research to implicate cortical hyperarousal, stemming from teratogenic effects on the dopaminergic system during fetal development. ¬© 2007 The Authors Journal compilation 2007 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.","Weiss, S.

2142,"Colic, sleep inertia, melatonin and circannual rhythms","Colic is periodic behavior occurring at the end of the day during the first 3 months of life characterized by crying. It is hypothesized that the crying at the end of the day is due to sleep inertia or a state dissociation during which the infant is simultaneously partially awake and partially asleep because of the absence of a melatonin diurnal rhythm. The melatonin timing mechanism, which codes for day length, is initiated prenatally by the maternal pineal gland, and after 3 months postnatally, the melatonin nocturnal secretion rhythm is maintained by the infant's pineal gland. To record the seasonal variation in day length away from the equator, 12 months are required to complete the melatonin chemical calendar. This circannual process is only 9 months completed at the time of birth, and 3 additional months are needed during which the infant may have difficulty reconciling cues for the timing of evening sleep due to discrepancies between the expected photoperiod derived from the prenatal maternal pineal melatonin circadian rhythm and the postnatally experienced photoperiod. Data is presented showing that the incidence of colic increases with increasing latitude in support of the hypothesis that infant crying at the end of the day during the first 3 months represents the last quarter of a circannual photoperiodic development process. ¬© 1992.","Weissbluth, M. and Weissbluth, L.",0,1708
2143,"The LINA cohort: Indoor chemical exposure, circulating eosinophil/basophil (Eo/B) progenitors and early life skin manifestations","Background: Hematopoietic progenitor cells, especially those committed to the Eo/B lineage, are known to contribute to allergic inflammation. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether environmental factors are associated with changes in numbers of circulating Eo/B progenitors at 1 year of age. Methods: Peripheral blood from 60 1-year-old children enrolled in the LINA (Lifestyle and environmental factors and their Influence on Newborns Allergy risk) birth cohort was assessed for Eo/B progenitor cells (Eo/B CFU) using standardized and validated methylcellulose assays. Frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured in the presence of IL-3, IL-5 or GM-CSF, and Eo/B CFUs enumerated. Clinical outcomes and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) were documented by standardized questionnaires, and indoor volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations were assessed by passive sampling. Results: Children with skin manifestations (atopic dermatitis or cradle cap) within the first year of life had higher numbers of circulating IL-3-, IL-5- or GM-CSF-stimulated Eo/B CFUs (P < 0.05) at 1 year. In children with cradle cap, a positive correlation was found between Eo/B CFUs and exposure to ETS-related VOCs during pregnancy or at 1 year of age (P < 0.05). Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: This is the first demonstration that environmental exposures are positively associated with levels of circulating Eo/B progenitors. The recruitment and differentiation of Eo/B progenitors in response to environmental triggers may play a role in the development of skin manifestations during the first year of life. ¬© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Weisse, K. and Lehmann, I. and Heroux, D. and Kohajda, T. and Herberth, G. and R√∂der, S. and von Bergen, M. and Borte, M. and Denburg, J.",0,1709

2146,Diet and behavioural activity in 12-week-old infants,"Deposition of excess dietary energy occurs if energy intake exceeds expenditure. Anthropometric differences between breast-fed and formula-fed infants due to differences in energy deposition are frequently reported. It has been suggested that infant obesity may result from decreased levels of energy expenditure on physical activity. Infant diet may therefore influence energy balance by affecting behaviour and hence energy expenditure. Behavioural and motor activity of 25 formula-fed and 25 breast-fed infants were compared using activity diaries, temperament questionnaires and actometers. There were no anthropometric differences between the two groups. The breast-fed infants fed significantly more slowly than the formula-fed infants despite taking in similar milk volumes, and also fed significantly more frequently. Otherwise there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the daily time spent awake and content, asleep, fussy, or crying, nor with respect to gross motor activity and temperament. It is unlikely that energy balance of the two groups differed significantly on account of behavioural activity. ¬© 1995 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.","Wells, J.

The relationship between behavioral activity and energy expenditure was, therefore, investigated in 12 week infants. Behavior was assessed using activity diaries, temperament questionnaires, and actometers. Total energy expenditure and the energy cost of physical activity were estimated using the doubly labelled water method and indirect calorimetry.

Methods - Total energy expenditure (TEE) was estimated by the doubly labelled water method and fat free mass was estimated from the 18O dilution space. Behaviour was assessed by two 24 hour activity diaries. Subjects-Thirty four normal healthy infants. Results - TEE was negatively related to the time spent feeding and negatively related to the time spent upset. Body size, represented by fat free mass, accounted for only 19% of the variation in TEE, whereas the combination of fat free mass and two behavioral variables explained 46% of the variation in TEE.

Findings indicate that correlations between PD and subsequent child temperament ratings were accounted for statistically by concurrent levels of depression. Although fathers' ratings corroborated some aspects of maternal perceptions, levels of parental agreement were only moderately high. Moreover, discrepancies between the parents' reports were significantly associated with maternal depression, indicating that parental disagreement is more likely when the wife is dysphoric.

2161,Optimizing parent-infant sleep from birth to 6 months: A new paradigm,"Currently, the dominant paradigm for infant sleep from birth to 6 months is behavioral sleep interventions that aim to entrain the infant's biological patterns of sleep using techniques such as delayed response to cues, feed-play-sleep routines, sleep algorithms, and education of parents about ""tired cues"" and ""overstimulation."" A recent systematic literature review has identified that while behavioral sleep interventions may modestly increase the length of time an infant sleeps at night without signaling, they are not associated with improved infant or maternal outcomes and may have unintended negative consequences (Douglas & Hill, 2013). This article reviews the empirical literature on behavioral infant sleep interventions, sleep regulation, and sleep disturbance. Based on the available scientific literature, a new paradigm for infant sleep intervention, from birth to 6 months of age, is proposed. This new approach, the Possums Sleep Intervention, integrates interdisciplinary knowledge from developmental psychology, medical science, lactation science, evolutionary science, and neuroscience with third-wave contextual behaviorism, acceptance and commitment therapy, to create a unique, new intervention that supports parental flexibility, cued care, and the establishment of healthy biopsychosocial rhythms. ¬© 2014 Michigan Association for Infant Mental Health.","Whittingham, K. and Douglas, P.",0,1719

2165,Classification of Attachment and Its Determinants in Urban Irish Infants,"This study (part of the Dublin Child Development Study) had two aims: to establish the distribution of patterns of infant-mother attachment in an urban sample of Irish 18-month-old infants from predominantly working-class families and to examine factors which may influence the classification of attachment. Three main attachment groups were identified: 80% of infants were classified as secure (B), 15% as insecure-avoidant (A) and 5% as insecure-resistant (C). According to Belsky and Isabella‚Äôs (1988) conceptual framework, individual differences in attachment quality are multiply determined by three distal sources of influence: mother characteristics, infant characteristics and social context. Preliminary results indicated that stability in family of origin, emotional stability at 3 weeks, as well as empathy and maternal confidence at 18 months, were significantly related to infant-mother attachment security. There was also some evidence that maternal report of neonatal fussy-difficultness and caretaking problems may be related to subsequent insecure-resistant attachment.

2166,Discrete responses of adult subjects during exposure to infant cry sequences,"Presented recordings of cry sequences (up to 3.5 min duration) of healthy infants to adult Ss, using a discrete on-line (DOL) methodology in which Ss judged the crying simultaneously to the playback. Ss also rated the cry sequences via questionnaire subsequent to each playback. Data show prominent peaks in the profiles of DOL responses, where up to 70% of Ss responded within a sequential unit. This phenomenon was attributed to certain acoustical or other process parameters embodied in effective units or unit groups of the cry sequences. These units or unit groups were not restricted to certain parts of the sequences. However, intense crying expressed in previous parts of a sequence does not seem to be as relevant for the post-hoc rating as the last 20‚Äì25 sec. Five advantages are listed for the DOL-response approach to the estimation of infant crying.

2168,Fathers' experience of childbirth and its relation to crying in his infant,"Explored the experiences of 109 fathers during labor and delivery of their infant. In a previous part of the project, it was shown that Ss' negative experiences during the childbirth were correlated with the amount of crying in the infant during the first months after birth. The aim of the present study was to interpret fathers' experiences reported in an interview when the infant was between 6 mo and 1 yr of age. Complications during the delivery were significantly correlated with the amount of crying in the infant. Feelings of helplessness and guilt and feelings that staff behavior had been negative were more common in the fathers who experienced the delivery as a negative event. Locus of control seems to be the most relevant concept. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Wikander, Birgitta and Theorell, T√∂res",1,1724
2170,Some developmental aspects of infant cry,"Respiratory activity during crying was measured in a semilongitudinal study of 10 normal infants aged 2 days to 8 mo. Temporal aspects of respiration during crying showed marked change with age: The duration of the expiratory phase steadily increased, while the duration of the inspiratory phase remained remarkably constant, producing an ever-lower I-fraction. A previous study reported no developmental changes in the temporal aspects of the acoustic cry signal from 1 to 7 mo of age. Reasons for the divergent findings of the present study are presented, and it is suggested that respiratory behavior may be a better indicator of developmental changes in the crying act than the acoustic signal.

Results show that although the amount of stress experienced by parents was not great, new parenthood had a greater general impact on women than on men. In contrast, the effects of infant crying were greater on fathers than on mothers. Infant crying was related to mothers rating their infants more negatively, but feeling less inadequate. For fathers, infant crying was associated with greater anxiety, more concern about lifestyle changes, and ratings of themselves and their wives as low in potency.

2177,Newborn sex-specific transcriptome signatures and gestational exposure to fine particles: findings from the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort,"Background: Air pollution exposure during pregnancy has been associated with adverse birth outcomes and health problems later in life. We investigated sex-specific transcriptomic responses to gestational long- and short-term exposure to particulate matter with a diameter < 2.5 Œºm (PM2.5) in order to elucidate potential underlying mechanisms of action. Methods: Whole genome gene expression was investigated in cord blood of 142 mother-newborn pairs that were enrolled in the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. Daily PM2.5 exposure levels were calculated for each mother‚Äôs home address using a spatial-temporal interpolation model in combination with a dispersion model to estimate both long- (annual average before delivery) and short- (last month of pregnancy) term exposure. We explored the association between gene expression levels and PM2.5 exposure, and identified modulated pathways by overrepresentation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis. Results: Some processes were altered in both sexes for long- (e.g. DNA damage) or short-term exposure (e.g. olfactory signaling). For long-term exposure in boys neurodevelopment and RhoA pathways were modulated, while in girls defensin expression was down-regulated. For short-term exposure we identified pathways related to synaptic transmission and mitochondrial function (boys) and immune response (girls). Conclusions: This is the first whole genome gene expression study in cord blood to identify sex-specific pathways altered by PM2.5. The identified transcriptome pathways could provide new molecular insights as to the interaction pattern of early life PM2.5 exposure with the biological development of the fetus. ¬© 2017 The Author(s).","Winckelmans, E. and Vrijens, K. and Tsamou, M. and Janssen, B.

2178,"Associations between infant and toddler regulatory problems, childhood co-developing internalising and externalising trajectories, and adolescent depression, psychotic and borderline personality disorder symptoms","Background: Early regulatory problems (RPs) are associated with childhood internalising and externalising symptoms. Internalising and externalising symptoms, in turn, are associated with adolescent psychopathology (e.g. personality disorders, depression). We examined whether RPs are directly associated with adolescent psychopathology, or whether associations are indirect via childhood internalising and externalising symptoms.

We identify structure and attunement as key parenting principles during infancy. Structure represents reliance on regularity and routines in daily life. Attunement represents reliance on infant cues and close physical contact. We suggest parents' relative endorsement of these parenting principles is related to their choices about practices such as feeding, holding and night-time sleeping. We designed the Baby Care Questionnaire to measure parents' endorsement of structure and attunement, as well as their daily parenting practices. We report data demonstrating the factor structure, reliability and validity of the BCQ. The BCQ, to our knowledge, is the first comprehensive measure of parenting practices and principles during infancy.

2182,Social information reduces infants‚Äô avoidance of plants,"Plants have been a fundamental component of human diets over evolutionary time. However, plants pose dangers to humans due to the variety of toxic chemical and mechanical defenses they manufacture. Accordingly, recent developmental work has shown that infants exhibit a reluctance to touch plants‚Äîa behavioral strategy that is an effective way of mitigating plant dangers. A similar protective avoidance strategy occurs in the food domain, food neophobia, which can be reduced by social facilitation. In the current study we investigated whether infants modify their behavior toward plants when social information is present. We presented 8- to 18-month-olds with plants and control objects after an adult conveyed information about each object and measured infants‚Äô touch behavior. The results provide the first evidence that social information reduces infants‚Äô reluctance to touch plants and converge with previous findings that social facilitation reduces food neophobia.

2183,Symbolic expression of feelings and depressive symptoms in high-risk pregnant women,"Pregnant women using rural health departments for prenatal care often experience chronic stressors (minority status, poor education, low income, young age, and single parenting of young children) that contribute to depression. Yet these same women may be reluctant to express their feelings. Because depression has been related to negative patterns of motherchild interaction and even newborn irritability, it is important to identify symptoms in high-risk mothers. For years, symbolic methods of expression have been used to reveal psychological traits or to identify clinical diagnoses, but few have been used to evaluate pregnant women. Women attending a rural health department were administered a comprehensive health and psychosocial questionnaire, including the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). They were then asked to complete a drawing expressing their feelings regarding their pregnancy. The relationship between CES-D scores and drawing ratings determined by two different methods of interpretation (expert, non-expert) was then examined. Non-expert art analysis was able to distinguish those women with the highest scores on the depression index, while expert analysis was able to discern racial differences consistent with risk status. Suggestions for the use of this drawing measure in the clinical setting are discussed. Alternative (non-verbal) methods of assessment that may improve communication with pregnant women are important for optimizing maternal and infant health and well-being and child development.","Wobie, K. and Eyler, F.

To determine the efficacy of behavioral management counseling in the treatment of persistent, excessive infant crying (>3 hours per day). Design. Two treatments, one no treatment control group. Infants were group- matched according to baseline fuss/cry levels, sociodemographic, and infant variables. Treatments were carried out sequentially by the same counselors. Setting. Telephone counseling by volunteers (mothers) of CRY-SIS, a national support group for the parents of crying infants. Patients and interventions. Sequential sample of 27 mother-infant pairs receiving treatment 1 (Tr1, empathy: talking through the problem), 21 receiving treatment 2 (Tr2, behavioral management: specific care taking suggestions) and 44 receiving no treatment (C, controls). Infants were between 1 to 5 months of age. Measurements and results. Mother-infant pairs had a pretreatment baseline assessment and a posttreatment follow-up (3 months after baseline) using 1- week diaries. Total fuss/cry duration reduced significantly more in the behavioral management group (by 51%) than the empathy group (37%) or the control group (35%). This was mainly due to significantly reduced evening fussing/crying in Tr2 (67%) compared with Tr1 (45%) and C (42%). No differences in total number of fuss/cry bouts/day were found. However, the number of fuss/cry bouts reduced significantly more in the evening in Tr2 (by 55%) compared with Tr1 (27%) and C (32%). Behavioral management mothers evaluated the same counselors as more sympathetic, knowledgeable, and understanding Tr2 was also perceived by mothers to have helped them more in reducing the crying problem, coping with the infant, and improving the relationship with their infant than Tr1. No effects of treatment on infant difficult temperament were found. Conclusions. Behavioral management was more effective in reducing fussing/crying than spending time with the mother talking through the problem or just waiting for spontaneous remission. Treatment by suitably but briefly trained lay counselors is an inexpensive and successful treatment option.","Wolke, D. and Gray, P. and Meyer, R.",0,1739

Methods: A prospective longitudinal study of children born in a geographically defined area in Germany. N = 4427 children of 6705 eligible survivors (66%) participated at all 4 assessment points (neonatal, 5, 20, and 56 months of age). Excessive crying and feeding problems were assessed at 5 months. Mental development was measured with the Griffiths Scale at 20 months, and cognitive assessments were conducted at 56 months. Neonatal complications, neurological, and psychosocial factors were controlled as confounders in structural equation modeling and analyses of variance. Results: One in 5 infants suffered from single crying or feeding problems, and 2% had multiple regulatory problems, i.e., combined crying and feeding problems at 5 months. In girls, regulatory problems were directly predictive of lower cognition at 56 months, even when controlled for confounders, whereas in boys, the influence on cognition at 56 months was mediated by delayed mental development at 20 months. Both in boys and girls, shortened gestational age, neonatal neurological complications, and poor parent-infant relationship were predictive of regulatory problems at 5 months and lower cognition at 56 months. Conclusion: Excessive crying and feeding problems in infancy have a small but significant adverse effect on cognitive development.

A multimethod approach to the study of infant behavioral style was adopted. A consistent pattern of NOFT infants' behaviors in mothers' descriptions, in observation of play behavior, and in interaction with the examiner during standard testing emerged. NOFT infants were found to be more fussy, demanding, and unsociable. They were also less task-oriented and persistent, and their mothers expressed more negative emotions during play interaction. Mental development was significantly delayed in NOFT infants. The findings emphasize the importance of behavioral contributions from both infant and mother to the relationship problems characteristic of NOFT. ¬© 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Wolke, D. and Skuse, D. and Mathisen, B.",0,1743

Latino children are at higher risk of obesity than the general population, yet valid measure of feeding practices, one of which is the Infant Feeding Styles Questionnaire (IFSQ), have not been formally validated in Spanish. Objective: To validate the IFSQ among Latino families, we conducted confirmatory factor analysis of pressuring, restrictive, and responsive feeding constructs from the IFSQ. Design/Methods: The IFSQ was administered at the 12-month visit in the Greenlight study, a multi-center cluster randomized trial to prevent obesity. Parents were included if they were of Latino origin (n = 303) and completed an English or Spanish language modified IFSQ (without the indulgence construct). Scores from nine sub-constructs of the IFSQ were compared between English and Spanish language versions. We tested reliability with Cronbach's alpha coefficients and performed confirmatory factor analysis to examine factor loadings and goodness of fit characteristics, modifying constructs to achieve best fit. Results: Of 303 parents completing the IFSQ, 84% were born outside the US, and 74% completed the IFSQ in Spanish. Reliability coefficients ranged from 0.28 to 0.61 for the laissez-faire sub-constructs and from 0.58 to 0.83 for the pressuring, restrictive, and responsive sub-constructs. Results for all coefficients were similar between participants responding to an English and Spanish version of the IFSQ. Goodness of fit indices ranged from CFI 0.82-1 and RMSEA 0.00-0.31, and the model performed best in pressuring-soothing (CFI 1.0, RMSEA 0.00) and restrictive-amount (CFI 0.98, RMSEA 0.1) sub-constructs. Conclusions: In a sample of Latino families, pressuring, restrictive, and responsive constructs performed well.

2195,Neurodevelopmental Follow-Up,"Neurodevelopmental follow-up is a critical component of the evaluation of the neurological development and ongoing clinical needs of the high-risk newborn. Such follow-up is important because it has become increasingly clear that a substantial number of infants who exhibit neurological abnormalities in the newborn period will experience later neurological and developmental difficulties that are likely to seriously limit their educational, social, and other life course opportunities. Unfortunately, in the neonatal period, it is not always possible to accurately predict which infants will experience later neurodevelopmental problems and which will not.

In this review we have focused on several recent developments, in particular on the interplay between infant behaviour and maternal physiology in regulating breast milk supply. This will illustrate that many past and current clinical problems concerning breast‚Äêfeeding are likely to be of iatrogenic origin, the products of imposing arbitrary rules for breast‚Äêfeeding management. In order for the protective benefits to be fully realized it is necessary to ensure that breast‚Äêfeeding is free from prescriptive practices. We will illustrate the key role played by the infants' control of appetite in the hope of encouraging clinicians to empower infants to exercise more control over the feeding process. 1993 Japan Pediatric Society","Woolridge, M.

2197,Effects of Feeding Method on Infant Temperament,"This chapter identifies the earliest manifestations of behavioral style in human infants. It outlines the procedures that are employed to assess temperament and argues for the importance of certain dimensions relevant to later development. The criteria for importance are based on three considerations. First is the objective measurability of the dimensions, through the convergence of descriptions, assessments, and observations as appropriate. Second is the distinctiveness of the dimensions, that each involves a more or less independent aspect of temperament. Finally, the stability of the dimensions is of concern, that despite developmental change the components have a traceable link to later temperament, behavior, or other meaningful outcome. The chapter focuses on the relationship between early nutrition and temperament and analyzes the issue of early feeding regimen and its impact on the expression of temperament. ¬© 1993, Academic Press, Inc.","Worobey, J.",0,1747

Moreover, both mothers and infants were observed at home in interaction at 1 month. IBQ activity level, responsivity, and irritability exhibited stability from 2 weeks to 2 months and from 2 months to 12 months. However, only irritability was stable from 2 weeks to 12 months. Although stability of their rank ordering was apparent, IBQ ratings generally increased by the end of 1 year. Observed infant alertness and crying at 1 month were significantly related to IBQ irritability at the first two times of measurement. In contrast, maternal behaviors were associated with later IBQ estimates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Worobey, John and Blajda, Virginia M.",0,1748

2202,Infant difficulty and early weight gain: Does fussing promote overfeeding?,"Authors have recently suggested that difficult temperament in infancy may be associated with rapid weight gain, but no previous studies actually report associations between temperament and feeding as a response to infant distress. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether greater infant difficulty elicits more feeding, which in turn leads to more rapid weight gain in early infancy. One hundred fifty-four mother-infant pairs were visited at 3 and 6 months in their homes. Besides anthropometric measures, mothers kept a 24-h diary of their infants' sleep, cry and feed patterns, and answered questions regarding feeding and infant difficultness. The results showed that feeding occurred as a response to nearly half (48%) of the crying intervals recorded, though it more often occurred in the absence of crying (83%). Mothers were most likely to report holding or rocking their infant as the first strategy they would employ if their baby fussed or cried. A regression analysis that included crying, feeding, weaning, sleep and infant weight revealed maternal reports of numbers of feeds per day as the only variable that predicted weight gain from 3 to 6 months. Infant crying is often followed by feeding, and more frequent feeding may promote more rapid weight gain. However, feeding frequency in the first few months appears to be more a matter of maternal discretion than a yoked response to temperamental difficulty. This does not preclude the possibility that overfeeding in later infancy could be tied to temperamental difficulty and subsequently related to overweight in early childhood. ¬© 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Worobey, J. and Pe√±a, J. and Ramos, I. and Espinosa, C.",1,1751
2203,Symposium II: Infant and childhood nutrition and disease: How does infant behaviour relate to weight gain and adiposity?,"An understanding of how infant eating behaviour relates to later obesity is required if interventions in infancy are to be attempted. The aim of this paper is to review findings from the Gateshead Millennium Study to describe (i) what we have already established about the relationship between infant feeding transitions, infancy weight gain and eating behaviour and (ii) describe new analyses that examine how infant eating behaviour and temperament relate to infancy weight gain and childhood adiposity. The Gateshead Millennium Study recruited 1029 infants at birth and parents completed questionnaires five times in the first year. We have already described how starting solids and ceasing breast-feeding seems to be a response to rapid early weight gain, rather than a cause, and that parents identify and respond to the individual appetite characteristics of their child. A number of questions about eating behaviour at 12 months were used to construct an infancy eating avidity score that was positively associated with height at age 7-8 years, but not with an adiposity index constructed using bioelectrical impedance, waist and skinfolds. Infancy eating avidity score was associated with greater fussiness and lower satiety responsivity on the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire at age 6-8 years. Temperament measured at age 6 weeks and 8 months showed no consistent associations with either infancy weight gain or adiposity at 6-8 years.

2204,How does infant behaviour relate to weight gain and adiposity?,"An understanding of how infant eating behaviour relates to later obesity is required if interventions in infancy are to be attempted. The aim of this paper is to review findings from the Gateshead Millennium Study to describe (i) what we have already established about the relationship between infant feeding transitions, infancy weight gain and eating behaviour and (ii) describe new analyses that examine how infant eating behaviour and temperament relate to infancy weight gain and childhood adiposity. The Gateshead Millennium Study recruited 1029 infants at birth and parents completed questionnaires five times in the first year. We have already described how starting solids and ceasing breast-feeding seems to be a response to rapid early weight gain, rather than a cause, and that parents identify and respond to the individual appetite characteristics of their child. A number of questions about eating behaviour at 12 months were used to construct an infancy eating avidity score that was positively associated with height at age 7-8 years, but not with an adiposity index constructed using bioelectrical impedance, waist and skinfolds. Infancy eating avidity score was associated with greater fussiness and lower satiety responsivity on the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire at age 6-8 years. Temperament measured at age 6 weeks and 8 months showed no consistent associations with either infancy weight gain or adiposity at 6-8 years. While infancy may seem a logical time to intervene with children at risk of future obesity, the collective findings from this substantial population-based study largely suggest otherwise.","Wright, C.

2207,Excessive infant crying: Often not confined to the first 3 months of age,"Excessive crying/fussing in infancy may account for serious problems in mother‚Äìinfant interactions but is believed to be self-limiting around the age of 3 mo. A survey yielding 662 children (aged 9‚Äì36 mo) was used to estimate prevalence and the proportion of cases where this problem extends beyond the 3rd mo postpartum. Excessive infant crying/fussing during the 1st 3 mo of age was found in 21% and persisted for longer in 39.6% of these. Professionals consulting parents on crying problems should take into account its possible persistence for longer periods of time.

2209,"Interactions between perceptions of relationship quality and postnatal depressive symptoms in Australian, primiparous women and their partners","The present study aimed to investigate interactions between perceptions of quality of intimate partner relationship and postnatal depressive symptoms in members of heterosexual couples 6 months after the birth of their first infant, while controlling for other relevant risk and protective factors. Secondary analysis was conducted on data from a prospective community cohort study of Australian, primiparous women and their partners. The outcome measure was Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale score. Quality of intimate partner relationship, personality factors and infant behaviour were assessed using the standardised Intimate Bonds Measure, Vulnerable Personality Style Questionnaire and Barr Chart respectively. Complete data were available for 161 couples. Associations between Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores and own and partner ratings of the intimate partner relationship were estimated simultaneously using multilevel modelling. When other relevant factors were controlled, relationships in which partners were perceived as critical, coercive or intimidating were associated with significantly more depressive symptoms in individuals (P‚â§0.004) as well as their partners (P‚â§0.008). In both women and men, vulnerable personality traits, coincidental adverse life events and more infant crying and fussing were also associated with significantly more depressive symptoms. Thus, the quality of the intimate partner relationship is significantly associated with postnatal mental health in both women and men, especially in the context of coincidental stressful events including infant crying. ¬© La Trobe University 2014.","Wynter, K. and Rowe, H. and Fisher, J.",1,1756
2210,"Factors associated with father-to-infant attachment at 6¬†months postpartum: a community-based study in Victoria, Australia","Objective: To identify factors associated with father-to-infant attachment at 6¬†months postpartum. Background: Poor father-to-infant attachment can lead to developmental problems in infants. Some studies suggest that poor paternal mental health may be negatively associated with father-to-infant attachment, but there is currently little evidence about other potential risk factors for poor father-to-infant attachment, such as aspects of the intimate partner relationship and infant characteristics. Methods: A community sample of couples with a first infant was recruited from diverse Local Government Areas. Men completed two telephone interviews, at 4¬†weeks and 6¬†months postpartum. Father-to-infant attachment was assessed using the Parental Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ). Other standardised instruments included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to assess symptoms of depression and anxiety and the Intimate Bonds Measure (IBM) to assess quality of the intimate partner relationship. The outcome measure was Parental Attachment Questionnaire (PAQ) total score. Structural equation modelling was used to identify factors associated with lower PAQ scores. Results: Total PAQ scores were provided by 270 men. Poorer quality father-to-infant attachment was significantly associated with personality traits like oversensitivity (p¬†=¬†0.03), more symptoms of depression and anxiety (p¬†=¬†0.02), poorer quality partner relationship (p¬†=¬†0.01) and more frequent partner criticism of infant care (p¬†=¬†0.01). Conclusion: Fathers should be included in routine postnatal care. Critical behaviour by the partner is a potentially modifiable risk factor for poor father-to-infant attachment. Perinatal primary care health services programmes should focus on building parents‚Äô skills to provide sensitive, affirming care for each other and for the infant. ¬© 2016 Society for Reproductive and Infant Psychology.","Wynter, K. and Rowe, H. and Tran, T. and Fisher, J.",0,1757

2214,Prophylactic use of acetaminophen in children vaccinated with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis,"BACKGROUND: The present randomized non-blind trial was conducted to clarify the effect of analgesics on febrile responses of booster diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis (DTP) vaccine in 15-20 months old infants. METHODS: A total of 270 healthy infants were randomized to receive acetaminophen (10 mg/kg) along with DTP vaccine (group 1), 2 hours after vaccination (group 2), and after the appearance of febrile reactions or irritability following vaccination (group 3, control). In addition to study medication, if the axillary temperature was higher than 38 degrees C or if the infant seemed to be irritable, the parents were told to give acetaminophen (10 mg/kg) and record on a diary card. Vaccinees were monitored for local and systemic reactions. RESULTS: The incidences of local swelling, pain and erythema were not significantly different among the 3 groups. No difference was observed in the incidence of systemic reactions including febrile responses, irritability, anorexia, and vomiting among the 3 groups during the 7 days after vaccination. Of the infants, 45.1%, 46.7% and 51.9% manifested fever (axillary temperature > or =38 degrees C) within 24 hours after the vaccination in groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively (P>0.05). The second dose of acetaminophen was less in the control group than in the prophylactic groups (P=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of acetaminophen along with DTP vaccine or 2 hours after vaccination does not affect the occurrence of febrile responses following booster vaccination. Unnecessary use of analgesics should be prevented.","Yal√ßin, S. S. and G√ºm√º≈ü, A. and Yurdak√∂k, K.",0,1761

2218,Positive Parenting Matters in the Face of Early Adversity,"Introduction: A negative relationship between adverse childhood experiences and both physical and mental health in adulthood is well established, as is the positive impact of parenting on child development and future health. However, few studies have investigated unique influences of adverse childhood experiences and positive parenting together within a large, diverse early childhood sample. Methods: The study used data on all children aged 0‚Äì5 years (n=29,997) from the National Survey of Children's Health 2011/2012 to examine effects of positive parenting practices and adverse childhood experiences on early childhood social‚Äìemotional skills and general development. All analyses were performed in 2017 and 2018. Results: More than a third of the sample reported experiencing at least one adverse childhood experience. More than a fourth (26.7%) met study criteria for social‚Äìemotional deficits, and 26.2% met criteria for developmental delay risks. The number of adverse childhood experiences exhibited negative marginal associations with social‚Äìemotional deficits and developmental delay risks, whereas the number of positive parenting practices showed independent protective effects. Risks associated with an absence of positive parenting were often greater than those of four or more adverse childhood experiences, even among no/low adversity families. The population attributable fractions for social‚Äìemotional deficits and developmental delay risks were 17.3% and 13.9% (translating to prevalence reductions of 4.5% and 3.6%) when adopting all positive parenting practices and 4.5% and 7.2% (prevalence reductions of 1.2% and 1.9%) when eliminating adverse childhood experiences.

2219,Family synchronizers: Predictors of sleep-wake rhythm for Japanese first-time mothers,"The purpose of this study was to describe the association between the regularity of sleep patterns for first-time Japanese mothers in the early postpartum period and the sleep and wake activity of their infants and partners. Longitudinal time-series studies of 101 healthy Japanese childbearing couples were conducted between May 2002 and January 2003. Data were obtained from couples at 32-6weeks pregnancy and 4-5weeks after birth. The questionnaire packet for each father and mother included a demographic questionnaire, a sleep-wake log for 7 days, a social rhythm metric for 7 days and a morningness-eveningness questionnaire. A four-stage hierarchical multiple regression analysis was performed in which the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength was the dependent variable. The variance in postpartum sleep-wake rhythm strength for first-time mothers was explained by three predictor variables. Household income, the mother's chronotype during pregnancy and the father's daily social rhythm at 4-5weeks after birth made unique contributions to the variance (24.7%) in the mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength at 4-5weeks postpartum. A mother's own tendency to be a morning or evening chronotype and the regularity of the father's daily schedule of activities appear to influence first-time mother's sleep-wake rhythm strength during early postpartum recovery more than disruptions from the infant's sleep-wake activity itself. Health-care providers should counsel couples on how factors associated with the parents themselves may impact on the regularity of a mother's sleep patterns. ¬© 2007 The Authors","Yamazaki, A.",0,1765

Data were collected from 101 Japanese couples during their transition period to parenthood while raising their first child. The chronotypes that were analyzed reveal no differences in the couple's lives or sleep-wake rhythms.

2221,Recurrence of intussusception in childhood,"Intussusception is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction between 3 months and 6 years of age. Recurrence after reduction of intussusception in childhood is not rare. To assess the incidence and determinants of recurrence of intussusception in childhood, we conducted a prospective observation in an emergency service of a large referral center during a four-year period. We encountered 89 cases with intussusception of whom nine cases (10.1%) had episodes of recurrent intussusception. Five patients had a single recurrence, three had double recurrence and one had triple recurrence. Age of first intussusception, sex, or concurrent adenovirus infection was not related to the recurrence. None of the 27 patients who needed operative reduction had recurrence, while 9 of 62 patients who were reduced successfully by barium enema developed recurrence (P = 0.05). Compared with the first episode, significantly less vomiting, rectal bleeding and shorter duration of abdominal pain or irritable crying were noted during recurrent episodes. All the recurrent episodes were reduced successfully by barium enema. We conclude that recurrent intussusception in childhood tends to be diagnosed earlier than previous episodes and treated successfully by hydrostatic reduction without complication. Surgical reduction of recurrent intussusception may be reserved for cases of failure of hydrostatic reduction, positive peritoneal sign or existence of pathological lead point because of favorable response to barium reduction. Recurrent intussusception seldom occurs in patients who underwent surgical reduction.","Yang, C. M. and Hsu, H. Y. and Tsao, P. N. and Chang, M. H. and Lin, F. Y.",0,1767
2222,Treatment of congenital vertical talus: Comparison of minimally invasive and extensive soft-tissue release procedures at minimum five-year follow-up,"Background: The most common historical treatment method for congenital vertical talus is extensive soft-tissue release surgery. A minimally invasive treatment approach that relies primarily on serial cast correction was introduced almost ten years ago, with promising early results. The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term outcome of patients with congenital vertical talus managed with the minimally invasive technique and compare them with a cohort treated with extensive soft-tissue release surgery. Methods: The records of twenty-seven consecutive patients with vertical talus (forty-two feet) were retrospectively reviewed at a mean of seven years (range, five to 11.3 years) after initial correction was achieved. The minimally invasive method was used to treat sixteen patients (twenty-four feet), and extensive soft-tissue release surgery was used to treat eleven patients (eighteen feet). Patient demographics, ankle range of motion, the PODCI (Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument) questionnaire, and radiographic measurements were analyzed. Results: At the latest follow-up, the mean range ofmotion of patients treated with theminimally invasive method was 42.4¬∞ compared with 12.7¬∞ for patients treated with extensive surgery (p < 0.0001). The PODCI normative pain and global function scores were superior in the minimally invasive treatment group compared with the extensive soft-tissue release group. Greater correction of hindfoot valgus (anteroposterior talar axis-first metatarsal base angle) was achieved in the minimally invasive treatment group compared with the extensive surgery group (40.1¬∞ versus 27.9¬∞, p = 0.03), although all other radiographic values were similar between the two groups (p > 0.1 for all). Subgroup analysis of patients with isolated vertical talus also showed superior range of motion and PODCI normative global function scores in the minimally invasive group. Conclusions: The minimally invasive treatment method for vertical talus resulted in better long-term ankle range of motion and pain scores compared with extensive soft-tissue release surgery. Longer-term studies are necessary to determine whether the improved outcomes are maintained into adulthood and whether the superior outcome is related to reduced scarring.

Prospective application of the CLLS and interobserver agreement for the score had not been evaluated in a controlled trial. A study of children and their parents was used to evaluate the CLLS and determine the incidence of AMS in preverbal children. METHODS: A prospective, controlled trial. Children > or =3 months and < or =36 months old and their parents living below 1645 m were studied over 7 separate days. The CLLS, measured daily by the mother as well as by the father on days 5 and 6, is the sum of scores for fussiness (FS), eating (E), playfulness (P), and sleep (S). Children were studied on days 1 and 2 at home, on day 3 after travel without altitude gain to a hotel, on day 4 at home, on days 5 and 6 at a hotel at 3109 m, and on day 7 at home. Using our previous criteria, AMS was diagnosed if the CLLS was > or =7 with both the FS > or =4 and the E + P + S > or =3. Agreement between mothers' and fathers' CLLS values was measured with the kappa statistic (K). Adults were also evaluated for AMS by the CLLS on days 5 and 6.

2230,"A collaborative approach to early identification and referral of children who are in family childcare settings, birth to five, born to teenage mothers","Children of teenage mothers are at high risk for developmental delays, intellectual and learning disabilities, behavior disorders and school related problems [1]. Early identification and referral into prevention or early intervention programs may ameliorate that risk. Children of teen mothers who are in family childcare may not have access to routine developmental and behavioral screenings that would lead to early identification and referral. Members of an early childhood advisory board collaborated to conduct a screening event using the ASQ-3¬Æ and the ASQ:SE¬Æ at a local children's museum for 26 children of teen mothers who had no previous access to developmental screenings. Parents completed the questionnaires while playing with their children at the museum. Nine of the children scored well within the range of typical development and 17 scored at or beyond the cut-off scores on the ASQ-3 and/or the ASQ:SE. Each child who scored at or beyond the cut-off received referrals for evaluation, parent and child programming and/or family support services. When there were concerns, families also received care coordination while all families received activities and a child's book. The implications for this study suggest that collaborative efforts are effective in providing access to developmental screenings and referral into subsequent services for at-risk young children who are in family childcare settings. ¬© 2015 Lifescience Global.","Yockelson, S. and Linder, C. and Asman, R.",0,1773

2233,Assessment of nocturnal sleep architecture by actigraphy and one-channel electroencephalography in early infancy,"To elucidate characteristic sleep architecture of different nocturnal sleep patterns in early infancy. Methods: Participants were 27 infants at the same conceptional age of 3-4months. Nocturnal sleep of these infants was monitored at home by simultaneously using actigraphy and a one-channel portable EEG device. According to the infants' activity for 6h from sleep onset, each night's sleep pattern was classified into three categories: sleeping through the night (STN), sleeping with weak signals (crying/fuss episodes < 10min or fed), and sleeping with strong signals (crying/fuss episodes. AÀô10min). Associations of sleep patterns with sleep variables (percentage of time in sleep stages, pattern of slow-wave sleep (SWS) recurrence, etc.) were investigated. Results: Analysis was conducted in 95 nights. STN pattern (n=36) was characterized by suppressed body movements while EEG represented a state of wakefulness. Weak signal pattern (n=27) tended to indicate rich and regular distributions of SWS across the night. Strong signal pattern (n=32) was characterized by reduced sleep time, although the amount of SWS was not reduced to that degree. Exclusively breastfed infants accounted for 78% of weak signal patterns, whereas formula-feeding infants, 67% of STN patterns. In several nights with STN or strong signal pattern, SWS did not occur in > 50% of the sleep cycles. Multiple regression analysis showed that exclusive breastfeeding may increase the proportion of SWS in non-REM sleep. Conclusions: Each nocturnal sleep pattern was associated with some sleep architecture, part of which would be attributed to infant's feeding methods. ¬© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Yoshida, M. and Shinohara, H. and Kodama, H.",0,1775
2236,Sleep problems in preschoolers and maternal depressive symptoms: An evaluation of mother- and child-driven effects,"Child sleep problems are associated with maternal depressive symptoms. It is unclear to what extent the association is due to direct effects or common risk factors for mother and child. Direct effects could represent child-driven processes, where child sleep problems influence maternal depressive symptoms, or mother-driven processes, where maternal depressive symptoms influence child sleep problems. Common factors could be shared genetic and familial environmental risk. Child- and mother-driven processes are direct in the sense that they are not due to common factors. However, such processes could be mediated by a range of unmeasured variables. By using an autoregressive fixed-effects model on a communitybased longitudinal sample comprising 956 families assessed when children were 1.5, 2.5, and 4 years of age, we estimated the direction of effect between, and common causes of, child sleep problems and maternal depressive symptoms. We were able to explain the association between child sleep problems and maternal depressive symptoms by both child-driven and mother-driven processes. The effect of child-driven processes was significantly larger than the effect of mother-driven processes. The clinical implication of the study is that treatment of child sleep problems will have considerable effect on maternal depressive symptoms. Furthermore, our model supports that treatment of current child sleep problems will have a direct effect on future sleep problems and also an indirect effect on future maternal depressive symptoms. We recommend that health professionals assess child sleep problems in mothers at risk for depression. ¬© 2017 American Psychological Association.","Ystrom, H. and Nilsen, W. and Hysing, M. and Sivertsen, B. and Ystrom, E.",0,1776
2237,"Effects of relaxation therapy on maternal psychological state, infant growth and gut microbiome: Protocol for a randomised controlled trial investigating mother-infant signalling during lactation following late preterm and early term delivery","Background: Breastfeeding is of great importance for infant health both short and long term, especially for those born preterm. Apart from the socio-economic and cultural factors which may influence a mother's decision on breastfeeding, lactation performance is also influenced by maternal physiological and psychological condition, as well as infant behavioural factors. The aim of this project is to investigate physiological, psychological and anthropological aspects of 'signalling' between mother and infant during lactation in a stressful situation, following late preterm delivery, using an experimental approach. Method: A single blind parallel randomised controlled trial will be conducted in Chinese primiparous mothers who deliver a infant (34 0/7-37 6/7) weeks and plan to exclusively breastfeed. Mothers will be recruited from four local community clinics attached to Beijing Children Hospital. Two home visits will be arranged at one week and eight weeks postpartum. Participants will be randomly assigned to either intervention arm or control (no intervention) before the first home visit. Mothers from the intervention group will be asked to listen to an audio recording with relaxation meditation daily during breastfeeding. Maternal stress and anxiety will be measured at one week and eight week postpartum using Chinese version of Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Infant weight and length gain (as SD scores) from one to eight week will be measured using anthropometry. Milk volume will be measured using 48-h test-weighing method. Breast milk samples and mother and infant's stool samples will be collected to measure macronutrient and microbiome content. Anthropometric measurements (weight, length and head circumference) will be performed during all home visits. Discussion: Primary outcomes of this study will be the effect of the intervention on maternal psychological state, and infant growth. Other outcomes will include the effect of the intervention on milk production, infant behaviours, and the microbiome composition in breastmilk and maternal and infant's gut. Results of this study will provide greater understanding about maternal-infant factors which influence the success of breastfeeding, and which may then be useful targets for future interventions.

2238,Comparison of effective inspired concentration of sevoflurane in preterm infants with different postconceptual ages,"OBJECTIVE: Screening examination for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is stressful and painful to the neonate. Sevoflurane has been used successfully in anesthesia for full-term and premature neonates and has been recently used for pediatric outpatient procedures. In this study, we examined the effective inspired concentration of sevoflurane to prevent movement in response to stimulation of examination in 50% of patients (EIC50) of sevoflurane, as well as the response of sevoflurane to age in the preterm outpatients undergoing fundus examination. METHODS: Preterm pediatric outpatients at different postconceptual ages (duration from the mother's last menstrual period to the date when the examination for ROP was performed) with <44 weeks (group A) and 44-64 weeks (group B) undergoing fundus examination were included. SpO(2) and ECG were monitored in operation room. In the process of anesthetic induction, the oxygen flow rates were 3 l¬∑min(-1), and subjects spontaneously breathed 6% sevoflurane by mask. The time to loss of movement was recorded as induction time. Six percent sevoflurane was inhaled continuously for the same duration, and then the inspired concentration of sevoflurane was adjusted to maintenance concentration. When no movement or crying was observed, the speculums were used to keep the eyelids open, and then the eye examinations were performed by the same ophthalmologist. During induction time and maintenance time, the occurrence of coughing, clenching, gross purposeful movement, breath holding or desaturation to SpO(2) < 95% was recorded. After completion of the procedure, patients were observed in the same room until spontaneous eye opening or verbalization occurred. Up and down method was used to determine subsequent maintenance concentration in each group. The initial maintenance concentration was 3%. The gradient of increase or decrease was 0.5%. If the preceding subject had not moved, the sevoflurane concentration was decreased by 0.5%","Yu, L. and Sun, H. and Yao, L. and Feng, Y. and Yang, B.",0,1778
2239,Anesthesia with sevoflurane or isoflurane induces severe hypoglycemia in neonatal mice,"Sevoflurane and isoflurane are among the most commonly used general anesthetics for children including infants, but their impact on metabolism, especially on blood glucose level, in children is not well understood. We investigated the impacts of anesthesia of neonatal (7‚Äì8 days old) and adult (2‚Äì3 months old) mice with the inhalational anesthetics 2.5% sevoflurane or 1.5% isoflurane, or the injectable anesthetics propofol (150 mg/kg) or avertin (375 mg/kg), for up to 6 hours. We found that sevoflurane and isoflurane induced severe hypoglycemia in neonatal mice and that this phenomenon was specific to the inhalational anesthetics because the injectable anesthetics propofol and avertin did not induce hypoglycemia. Surprisingly, the inhalational anesthesia induced hyperglycemia instead in adult mice. We also demonstrated that the inhalational anesthesia-induced hypoglycemia was a major cause of death for the neonatal mice receiving intranasal administration of saline prior to anesthesia. These studies revealed severe hypoglycemia in neonatal mice during anesthesia with sevoflurane or isoflurane. If this phenomenon also occurs in human, our findings would warrant closely monitoring blood glucose level and maintaining it in the normal range in infants receiving inhalational anesthesia. ¬© 2020 Yu et al.

2240,"Parental behaviors and sleep/wake patterns of infants and toddlers in Hong Kong, China","Background: To describe the sleep patterns of children below 36 months in Hong Kong, and evaluate the associations between parental behaviors and childhood sleep/wake patterns. Methods: Parents of 1049 infants and toddlers completed an internet-based expanded version of the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Results: Total sleep duration (P<0.001), frequency (P<0.001) and duration (P<0.001) of nocturnal awakenings decreased with age, whereas the longest sleep duration (P<0.001) and nocturnal sleep duration (P<0.001) increased with age. Children who room- or bed-shared with parents had later bedtimes (P<0.001), but similar sleep duration compared with those who had a separate sleep location. Falling asleep independently was associated with longer nocturnal sleep duration (P<0.001) and less sleep awakenings (P<0.001). Full-time employment of parents was associated with shorter total sleep duration of children (P<0.001). Although breastfeeding was associated with more nocturnal awakenings (P<0.001), no association was detected between breastfeeding and shorter sleep duration in children. Conclusions: As infants and toddlers develop, their sleep consolidates. Falling asleep independently was associated with longer nocturnal sleep duration and fewer sleep awakenings, whereas sleep location was not. This is an important finding, especially for families with limited living space where parent/child room- or bed-sharing cannot be avoided. ¬© 2017, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Yu, X.

2241,Early determinants of food liking among 5y-old children: A longitudinal study from the EDEN mother-child cohort,"Background: Identifying the determinants of child's liking for different foods may help to prevent future choices of unhealthy food. Objective: To study early-life food-related characteristics associated with child's liking for different foods at 5y with a longitudinal study. Design: 1142 5y- old children completed a liking test for ""fruit and vegetables"", ""meat, fish and eggs"", desserts and cheese. Data related to maternal food intake before pregnancy, infant feeding during the first year of life, maternal feeding practices at 2y, child's food intake at 3y, and child's food neophobia from 1 to 4y were collected prospectively from the mother. The associations between these factors and child's liking for each category of foods were analyzed using structural equation modelling. Results: High food neophobia at 4 y was related to lower child's liking for all food groups. Maternal feeding practices at 2y were associated with liking for dessert: negatively for the practices allowing child to control his/her own food intake, positively for restriction of child's food intake for weight reasons. Moreover, child's food intake at 3y was positively associated with child's liking for ""fruit and vegetables"" as well as for cheese. Finally, adherence to the infant feeding pattern ""long breastfeeding, later introduction of main meal components and use of home-made products"" was positively associated with child's liking for meat/fish/eggs. Conclusions: For all food groups, food neophobia was a common determinant of child's liking for food at 5y, whereas other factors were associated with food liking for specific food groups. ¬© 2016 Yuan et al.","Yuan, W.

A 4 to 9 million occurrences of infant asphyxia are reported each year by WHO. Early diagnosis of asphyxia is important to avoid complications such as damage to the brain, organ and tissue that could lead to fatality. This is possible with the automation of screening of infant asphyxia. Here, a non-invasive Asphyxia Screening Kit is developed. It is a Graphical User Interface that automatically detects asphyxia in infants from early birth to 6 months from their cries and displays the outcome of analysis. It is built with Matlab GUI underlied with signal processing algorithms, capable of achieving a classification accuracy of 96.03%. Successful implementation of ASK will assist to screen infant asphyxia for reference to clinicians for early diagnosis. In addition, ASK also provides an interface to enter patient information and images to be integrated with existing Hospital Information Management System.","Zabidi, A. and Khuan, L.

2251,Adult responses to cries of low and high risk infants,"Asked 30 parents and 30 nonparents to select on a questionnaire what they considered to be appropriate responses to tape-recorded pain cries elicited from 16 2-day-old infants. Half of the cries were from healthy, low-risk (LR) infants, and half were from healthy infants at high risk (HR). The cries from HR Ss elicited from parents, but not from nonparents, responses that were intended as more ""tender and caring"" and more ""immediately effective at terminating the crying"" than the cries from LR Ss. Similarly, responses by parents, but not by nonparents, to HR cries were more consistent than to LR cries. 21 of 30 parents gave contact-comfort kinds of responses to the cries of HR Ss, while none gave undirected responses. Although the differential cry features characteristic of the HR infant have traditionally been used to support the differential diagnosis of CNS pathology, findings support a more functional perspective of the cries of the risk infant.

2252,"Acoustic characteristics of naturally occurring cries of infants with ""colic.""","Studied 11 Ss with Wessel's colic, 15 Ss with nonWessel's colic, and 22 control Ss (aged 4-wks) who produced naturally occurring cry bouts both pre and postevening feeding. Standard and vociferous cry segments (VCS) were selected from up to 2 min of taperecorded crying for spectrum analysis. VCSs had a longer duration, a higher fundamental frequency, and a greater percentage of dysphonation than did standard segments. After feeding, Ss who were problematic criers, independent of Wessel's criteria, showed a greater percentage of dysphonation in the VCS than did control Ss. This finding resulted from a decrease in dysphonation in the cries of control Ss after feeding and an increase in those of Ss with nonWessel's colic. Dominant frequency also increased after feeding in the VCS of Ss with Wessel's colic, resulting in these Ss having higher-pitched cries after feeding than Ss in the other 2 groups. Results indicate that Ss who are perceived to have problematic crying have objectively different acoustic features in their cry sounds that are particularly aversive.

Results indicate wide individual differences in temporal morphology between infants and within infant cry sounds. Binary spectrum analysis of the presence of EPSs in the cry sound detected rhythms in temporal organization at a wide range of dominant frequencies. Spectral complexity was related to a longer time since infants were last fed and shorter EPSs. Results emphasize the importance of viewing cries of young infants as dynamic signals.

Migraine and tension-type headache (TTH) are the most common primary headache forms among pediatric population. Several studies have investigated the incidence of infant colic in patients with migraine and TTH. The meta-analysis was to assess the relationship between infant colic and migraine as well as TTH. Methods. PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched until August 16, 2018, for potential studies. Data were extracted by two independent authors and analyzed using RevMan 5.2 software. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to determine the association between infant colic and migraine as well as TTH, respectively. Results. A total of 148 studies were found, and 7 studies were finally included. A higher incidence of colic during infancy was revealed in migraine patients than controls (P=0.05, OR: 2.51, 95% CI: 1.32-4.77) and TTH subjects (P=0.02, OR: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13-0.86), respectively. And no significances were found between TTHs with controls (P=0.51, OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.73-1.89). Conclusion.

As an important determinant of good parenting, maternal self-efficacy (MSE) should be paid more attention by researchers. At present, the limitations of previous research about MSE during infancy are that the factors which influence MSE remained poorly explored, there were few studies with Chinese women, and the studies did not consider the effect of different cultures. Objectives: to explore factors which influence MSE in primiparous women in China in the first three months postnatally. Methods: a quantitative longitudinal study using questionnaires was conducted. In total, 420 Chinese primiparous women were recruited in obstetric wards at three hospitals in Xiamen City, Fujian Province of China. Initial baseline questionnaires to measure socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were distributed to participants face-to-face by the researcher on the postnatal ward at three days postnatally.

DESIGN: randomised controlled trial. SETTING: in the postpartum unit of one university-affiliated hospital in China from August 2013 to February 2014. PARTICIPANTS: among 288 healthy-term neonates recruited, 250 completed the trial. All neonates were undergoing heel lancing for metabolic screening, were breast fed, and had not been fed for the previous 30 minutes. INTERVENTIONS: all participants were randomly assigned into four groups - BF, MT, BF+MT, and no intervention - with 72 neonates in each group. Neonates in the control group received routine care. Neonates in the other three intervention groups received corresponding interventions five minutes before the heel lancing and throughout the whole procedure. MEASUREMENTS: Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS), latency to first cry, and duration of first crying. FINDINGS: mean changes in NIPS scores from baseline over time was dependent on the interventions given. Neonates in the BF and combined BF+MT groups had significantly longer latency to first cry, shorter duration of first crying, and lower pain mean score during and one minute after heel lance, compared to the other two groups. No significant difference in pain response was found between BF groups with or without music therapy. The MT group did not achieve a significantly reduced pain response in all outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: BF could significantly reduce pain response in healthy-term neonates during heel lance. MT did not enhance the effect of pain relief of BF. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: healthy-term neonates should be breast fed to alleviate pain during heel lance. There is no need for the additional input of classical music on breast feeding in clinic to relieve procedural pain. Nurses should encourage breast feeding to relieve pain during heel lance.","Zhu, J. and Hong-Gu, H. and Zhou, X. and Wei, H. and Gao, Y. and Ye, B. and Liu, Z. and Chan, S. W.",0,1797
2262,Study on earthquake risk reduction from the perspectives of the elderly,"In many areas, disasters are a paramount risk to the lives and livelihoods of people and to their social-economic development. Earthquakes are among the most dangerous geologic phenomena on our planet. The elderly are particularly exposed to disaster risk and are likely to suffer from higher rates of mortality, morbidity and economic damage to their livelihoods. However, they are seldom given due consideration in disaster response from their perspectives, such as their unique capabilities and experiences, familiar societal roles, living conditions and specific needs. Furthermore, the elderly are often neglected particularly when compared to children. Using a quantitative methodology, this article aims to evaluate whether age has an impact on mortality rate, explores age groups with the greatest vulnerabilities of the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, in China and the 1995 Kobe Earthquake, in Japan. Data of the final death tolls and total population sorted by age in the two afore-mentioned earthquakes were collected from the HYOGO Pref-medical Association and the Dujiangyan Bureau of Statistics. One-way ANOVA (multiple comparison analysis) was applied to analyze the data. Results of this study showed that in the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake in China and the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan there is a greater significance in the relationship between the elderly aged over 75 and the mean mortality rate than that of children. To achieve greater resilience to disasters requires that older people's significant vulnerabilities are identified, and considerations discussed from their own unique perspectives are recognized and promoted to enhance disaster risk reduction. ¬© 2016","Zhu, X. and Sun, B.",0,1798
2263,Clarifying nipple confusion,"Nipple confusion, an infant's difficulty with or preference for one feeding mechanism over another after exposure to artificial nipple(s), has been widely debated. This is in part due to conflicting statements, one by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2005 suggesting that infants should be given a pacifier to protect against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and the other by the World Health Organization in 2009 stating that breastfeeding infants should never be given artificial nipples. Despite the limited and inconsistent evidence, nipple confusion is widely believed by practitioners. Therefore, there is a unique opportunity to examine the evidence surrounding nipple confusion by assessing the research that supports/refutes that bottle feeding/pacifier use impedes breastfeeding efficacy/success/duration. This review examined 14 articles supporting and refuting nipple confusion. These articles were reviewed using the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice Rating Scale. Based on our review, we have found emerging evidence to suggest the presence of nipple confusion only as it relates to bottle usage and found very little evidence to support nipple confusion with regards to pacifier use. The primary difficulty in conclusively studying nipple confusion is establishing causality, namely determining whether bottles'/pacifiers' nipples are causing infants to refuse the breast or whether they are simply markers of other maternal/infant characteristics. Future research should focus on prospectively examining the causality of nipple confusion. ¬© 2015 Nature America, Inc.","Zimmerman, E. and Thompson, K.",0,1799
2264,Using cognitive mapping to understand Senegalese infant and young child feeding decisions,"Caregivers make decisions about how to feed their infants and young children based on complex interactions of knowledge, beliefs, and values, as well as assessments of situational determinants, including economic and social constraints and opportunities. Because of the relationship of these factors to the adoption of new feeding behaviours, the development of nutrition interventions for this age group must be grounded in knowledge about the target population. This paper presents the results of a study that used cognitive mapping techniques to gain insight into mothers' knowledge and perceptions of foods for infants and young children and examine their significance for feeding decisions in Saint-Louis, northern Senegal. Guided by mixed-methods protocols from the Focused Ethnographic Study for Infant and Young Child Feeding Manual, in-depth interviews that included qualitative discussions and cognitive mapping techniques were conducted with 46 mothers in rural and peri-urban communities. We explored mothers' perceptions about five dimensions that affect food decision-making‚Äîhealthiness, convenience, child acceptance, appeal, and modernity‚Äîand the relationship of these dimensions to 38 local food items. Data analysis entailed a combination of qualitative thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. In both communities, ‚Äúhealthiness‚Äù was the most valued dimension for food decision-making by a large margin, followed by child acceptance, appeal, modernity, and convenience. We explore how different interpretations and definitions of these dimensions, and their relationship to specific local food items, may influence the design and planning of nutrition interventions. The results support the importance of mixed-methods formative research to illuminate the emic perspectives of caregivers. ¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Zobrist, S. and Kalra, N. and Pelto, G. and Wittenbrink, B. and Milani, P. and Diallo, A.

2266,"Maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy, and newborn irritability","Maternal depression is associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes for children, including poor mother-infant interactions at 3 months post-partum. The aim of this study is to determine whether maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy are associated with neonatal neurobehavioral functioning, as measured by the Neurologic and Adaptive Capacity Scale. The study population consists of 1,123 mothers and their term infants who were participants in a larger study of maternal health and infant outcomes. Women were administered the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) questionnaire for depressive symptoms during their pregnancy. Their infants were subsequently assessed by a pediatrician blind to their CES-D scores. The CES-D score was associated with unconsolability and excessive crying (p less than 0.01). The higher the mother's CES-D score, the more likely it was that the infant would be unconsolable or cry excessively. Mothers with CES-D scores at the 90th percentile were 2.6 times more likely to have unconsolable newborns, compared with women with CES-D scores at the 10th percentile (95% C.I. = 1.54, 4.23). When potentially confounding variables, such as cigarette smoking, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine use, poor weight gain, income, birth weight, and other drug use, were controlled, the relationship between CES-D score and newborn unconsolability and excessive crying remain unchanged. The results of this study suggest that the relationship between early childhood problems and maternal depressive symptoms may be part of a sequence that starts with depressive symptoms during pregnancy.","Zuckerman, B. and Bauchner, H. and Parker, S. and Cabral, H.",0,1801
2267,"Characteristics of infants admitted to hospital for persistent colic, and comparison with healthy infants","Aim: To describe clinical characteristics of infants with colic admitted to hospital because of ongoing excessive crying (colic). Methods: Characteristics of 104 infants admitted to hospital because of severe excessive crying (cases) were compared to those of 100 healthy thriving controls randomly selected from records of well baby clinics. Results: Half of the cases were reported to cry excessively from the day of birth, and feeding changes had been recommended in 77%. A medical cause of excessive crying was identified in none of the cases. Almost all infants showed a rapid transition to normal crying behaviour during admission","Zwart, P. and Vellema-Goud, M. G.

22,Caregiving and Early Infant Crying in a Danish Community,"Maternal caregiving and fussing/crying in Danish infants at 3, 6, and 12 weeks were examined using self-report scales and 24-hour behavior diaries. Mothers reported practices commonly associated with responsive caregiving: frequent feeding, prompt response to infant cries, and considerable time holding the infant. Fuss/cry durations peaked in the first 2 months, were highest in evenings, and decreased approximately 50% by 12 weeks. Fussing was the majority behavior, and 9.2% of the infants fussed and cried more than 3 hours per day. In contrast with other Western studies, 24-hour fuss/cry durations were lower, and fussing accounted for up to 80% of total distress. Danish caregiving practices may partially explain the lower durations of infant distress and the lower ratio of cry to fuss. However, some infants fuss/cry a great deal despite sensitive care, which may reflect individual differences in infant maturation of behavior regulation.

45,Infants' transitions out of a fussing/crying state are modifiable and are related to weight status,"Currently, about 10% of infants have a weight for length greater than the 95th percentile for their age and sex, which puts them at risk for obesity as they grow. In a pilot obesity prevention study, primiparous mothers and their newborn infants were randomly assigned to a control group or a Soothe/Sleep intervention. Previously, it has been demonstrated that this intervention contributed to lower weight-for-length percentiles at 1 year; the aim of the present study was to examine infant behavior diary data collected during the intervention. Markov modeling was used to characterize infants’ patterns of behavioral transitions at ages 3 and 16 weeks. Results showed that heavier mothers were more likely to follow their infants’ fussing/crying episodes with a feeding. The intervention increased infants’ likelihood of transitioning from a fussing/crying state to an awake/calm state. A shorter latency to feed in response to fussing/crying was associated with a higher subsequent weight status. This study provides preliminary evidence that infants’ transitions out of fussing/crying are characterized by inter-individual differences, are modifiable, and are linked to weight outcomes, suggesting that they may be promising targets for early behavioral obesity interventions, and highlighting the methodology used in this study as an appropriate and innovative tool to assess the impact of such interventions.

56,More than meets the eye: Parental and infant contributors to maternal and paternal reports of early infant difficultness,"This study examined correspondences among maternal and paternal ratings of infant temperament, parental psychological functioning, and infant behavior. Participants included 120 families. When infants were 6 weeks old, mothers and fathers completed the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire (ICQ); reported on their own levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and parenting stress; and completed a 3-day diary of their infants' behavior. Infant irritability was assessed in a laboratory situation. Fathers rated their infants' temperament somewhat more negatively, but there was significant correspondence between maternal and paternal ratings on the temperament factors of fussiness, unadaptability, dullness, and a difficultness composite. Mothers and fathers are influenced by somewhat different factors in perceiving their babies' temperament, but both maternal and paternal reports have a basis in laboratory- and diary-based behaviors. Results indicate the strong contributing influence of infant irritability to the perception of difficult temperament and support the validity of parental reports of infant irritability in the first 6 weeks of life.

83,Does maternal attachment to her infant mediate the link between perceptions of infant crying at 6 months and parenting stress at 24 months? A structural equation modelling approach,"Background: Parenting stress is influenced by many factors including maternal attachment and excessive infant crying, yet the nature of these relationships is not well understood. For example, excessive infant crying despite maternal soothing may impact maternal attachment to the child, leading to higher stress. This paper explored whether maternal perception of excessive infant crying at 6 months was associated with higher maternal parenting stress at 24 months, and whether maternal attachment mediated this relationship. Methods: All families, present at 24 months in a randomized controlled trial of a 5‐year early intervention programme targeting school readiness skills in disadvantaged area of Ireland, were included. At 6 months, infant crying was assessed using a maternal reported measure of duration of infant crying, and maternal attachment to the infant was assessed using the Condon Maternal Attachment Scale. Parenting stress was assessed at 24 months using the childrearing stress subscale from the Parenting Stress Index. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the direct and indirect effects of maternal perceptions of excessive infant crying on parenting stress, controlling for infant, maternal, and environmental characteristics, and focusing on the mediating role of maternal attachment. Results: Reporting excessive infant crying at 6 months was associated with lower maternal attachment at 6 months, which led to higher parenting stress at 24 months. In addition, vulnerable adult attachment style, previous maternal mental health difficulties, low paternal education, paternal involvement with the child, and not being married were associated with higher parenting stress. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the association between maternal perceptions of excessive crying at 6 months and later parenting stress may be mediated through maternal attachment to the infant. Interventions based on improving maternal attachment could be investigated to determine the effectiveness of supporting mothers with low attachment.

94,Do educational materials change knowledge and behaviour about crying and shaken baby syndrome? A randomized controlled trial,"Background: Shaken baby syndrome often occurs after shaking in response to crying bouts. We questioned whether the use of the educational materials from the Period of PURPLE Crying program would change maternal knowledge and behavior related to shaking. Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial in which 1279 mothers received materials from the Period of PURPLE Crying program or control materials during a home visit by a nurse by 2 weeks after the birth of their child. At 5 weeks, the mothers completed a diary to record their behavior and their infants’ behavior. Two months after giving birth, the mothers completed a telephone survey to assess their knowledge and behavior. Results: The mean score (range 0–100 points) for knowledge about infant crying was greater among mothers who received the PURPLE materials (63.8 points) than among mothers who received the control materials (58.4 points) (difference 5.4 points, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1 to 6.5 points). The mean scores were similar for both groups for shaking knowledge and reported maternal responses to crying, inconsolable crying and self-talk responses. Compared with mothers who received control materials, mothers who received the PURPLE materials reported sharing information about walking away if frustrated more often (51.5% v. 38.5%, difference 13.0%, 95% CI 6.9% to 19.2%), the dangers of shaking (49.3% v. 36.4%, difference 12.9%, 95% CI 6.8% to 19.0%), and infant crying (67.6% v. 60.0%, difference 7.6%, 95% CI 1.7% to 13.5%). Walking away during inconsolable crying was significantly higher among mothers who received the PURPLE materials than among those who received control materials (0.067 v. 0.039 events per day, rate ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6). Interpretation: The receipt of the Period of PURPLE Crying materials led to higher maternal scores for knowledge about infant crying and for some behaviors considered to be important for the prevention of shaking.

1410,Prolonged and Unsoothable Crying Bouts in Infants with and without Colic,"The authors sought to determine which features of early distress were ""excessive"" and specific to the first months of life as described by diary recordings. In a short-term, longitudinal, controlled study, total daily amount, frequency, and bout duration of fussing, crying, and unsoothable crying were derived from validated diaries kept by parents of infants with and without diary-defined colic at 6 weeks and 5 months recruited from primary pediatrics practices. By definition, infants with colic demonstrated more distress at 6 weeks, but they also had a much greater reduction in distress by 5 months and more distress during the fifth month. However, bout frequencies and bout durations showed different patterns. Bout duration was longer for the colic group only at 6 weeks; the difference completely disappeared by 5 months. Bout frequency was higher for the colic group at 6 weeks and 5 months, but the reduction across ages was similar in infants with and without colic. These patterns were true for all distress modalities (fussing, crying, and unsoothable crying). Unsoothable crying was present in significant amounts only at 6 weeks but virtually disappeared by 5 months. The authors conclude that prolonged distress bouts and unsoothable crying are specific to the first few months and more common, though not unique, in infants with colic. This implies that our understanding of colic may depend more on why these infants cry longer once started than what makes infants cry. These features of parental experience may be important in preventive efforts to reduce negative impacts of early increased crying such as shaken baby syndrome.

204,Abnormal neurological soft signs in babies born to smoking mothers were associated with lower breastfeeding for first three months,"Aim: We examined associations between neurological alterations in infants born to smoking mothers and breastfeeding success at discharge and three months of age. Methods: This 2016 study compared 35 normal weight infants born to smoking mothers at 37–41 weeks and 35 matched controls born to non-smoking mothers at the Maternity Hospital of Careggi University, Florence, Italy. Neonatal behaviour was evaluated using the neurological soft signs (NSS) component of the Graham-Rosenblith Scale. Breastfeeding variables were measured using the LATCH score that covers: breast latching, audible swallowing, type of nipple, mother’s comfort and help they needed to hold their baby to their breast. A questionnaire on excessive crying and feeding was distributed at discharge, and further data were collected during a three-month telephone interview. Results: At discharge, the infants born to smoking mothers had a significantly lower LATCH score and significantly poorer performance on several items of the NSS component than the controls. The LATCH score and number of NSS were inversely proportional. At the three-month follow-up only 57.1% of the smoking group infants were breastfeeding compared with 87.5% of the control infants (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Infants with smoking mothers displayed altered neurobehavioural profiles and had a difficult start to breastfeeding.

217,Parental use of ‘cry it out’ in infants: No adverse effects on attachment and behavioural development at 18 months,"Background Leaving infant to cry it out has been the subject of discussion among researchers and parents. Nevertheless, there is paucity of empirical research investigating the association between leaving infant to cry it out and consequent crying duration and frequency, mother–infant attachment and behavioural development. Methods The sample with complete longitudinal data comprised 178 infants and their caretakers. Parental use of ‘leaving infant to cry out’ and cry duration were assessed with maternal report at term, 3, 6 and 18 months, and frequency of crying was assessed at term, 3 and 18 months of age. Attachment was measured at 18 months using the strange situation procedure. Behavioural development of the infant was assessed with two observational measures and a parent‐report questionnaire at 18 months. Results The use of ‘leaving infant to crying’ was rare at term and increased over the next 18 months. ‘Leaving infants to cry it out’ at term was associated with a decrease in crying frequency at 3 months. Furthermore, leaving infants to cry it out a few times at term and often at 3 months was associated with shorter fuss/cry duration at 18 months of age. No adverse impacts of leaving infants to cry it out in the first 6 months on infant–mother attachment and behavioural development at 18 months were found. Conclusions Contemporary practice of some parents in the United Kingdom to occasionally or often ‘leaving infant to cry it out’ during the first 6 months was not associated with adverse behavioural development and attachment at 18 months. Increased use of ‘leaving to cry it out’ with age may indicate differential responding by parents related to infant self‐regulation.

2410,Maternal self-efficacy reduces the impact of prenatal stress on infant’s crying behavior,"Objective: To determine whether prenatal stress is associated with behavioral and emotional regulation problems (crying/fussing) in infants, after controlling for confounding factors. Furthermore, the study investigated the stress-buffering effect of maternal self-efficacy. Study design: Data were collected in 120 pregnant women (29±3.2 weeks gestation) and their infants at 6 weeks of age. Expecting mothers completed a structured interview and self-report questionnaires on prenatal stress and self-efficacy. Crying/fussing data were obtained with a validated parental diary. Results: After controlling for confounding variables, multiple regression analyses show that prenatal stress and self-efficacy accounted for 20% of the variance of infant’s fussing and crying behavior. Results suggest a mediating role of self-efficacy. Babies of mothers reporting high levels of prenatal stress cried less when their mother had high levels of self-efficacy compared with mothers with low self-efficacy. In addition, mothers of infants with excessive crying reported more symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety in pregnancy. Conclusion: To foster the development of well-adapted parent-infant relationships and potentially to reduce infant crying in the early postpartum phase, health care professionals need special education about the effects of prenatal stress and interventions that promote self-efficacy.

274,"‘Oh, baby, please don’t cry!’: In infants suffering from infantile colic hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis activity is related to poor sleep and increased crying intensity","Background/Aim: Infantile colic (IC) is considered to represent the upper end of the spectrum of early developmental crying behavior. Little is known about hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis activity and sleep in relation to infants’ crying. The aim of the present study was to assess cortisol secretion in infants in relation to their sleep and crying patterns. Method: Sixteen infants (mean age: 8 weeks; SD = 1.5 weeks) were enrolled. Their mothers completed a series of questionnaires regarding the infants’ crying and sleeping patterns. The infants’ sleep was objectively assessed with actigraphs. After 4 weeks, the infants were assessed once again. Cortisol secretion was measured by means of saliva samples in the mornings after awakening. Results: Morning saliva cortisol levels were related to more frequent awakening and to increased crying intensity, but not to sleep or crying duration. Over 4 weeks, both crying behavior and sleep duration decreased, but there was no association between them. Cortisol secretion did not significantly change. Conclusions: In infants suffering from IC, fragmented sleep patterns and increased saliva cortisol levels were related. Cortisol secretion seems to be related to crying intensity, but not to crying duration. Crying intensity may reflect greater physiological or psychological stress rather than mere duration of crying.

3210,"Infantile colic, maternal smoking and infant feeding at 5 weeks of age","Background: Many parents seek help from health professionals because of their infants’ persistent crying in the early months. The aetiology of this condition, often labelled ""infantile colic"", is still unclear. Aims: To assess whether smoking during pregnancy, and/or smoking at infant age 5 weeks, is associated with infantile colic, and to describe how feeding at infant age 5 weeks and smoking are related to colic. Methods: This was a community-based study, with telephone interviews in late pregnancy, and at infant age 5 weeks, covering 1,625 mother–infant dyads, i.e. 86% of the eligible population. Results: Daily maternal smoking in pregnancy was related to subsequent colic, with an age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.74 (95% confidence interval 1.08–2.82). In the multivariate model, the OR was largely unaltered. The association between smoking at infant age 5 weeks and colic did not reach statistical significance. The subgroups based on smoking and infant feeding were small, but the results suggest that exclusive breast-feeding was protective against colic, including for infants of smoking mothers. Conclusions: This study presents yet another argument why smoking in pregnancy should be discouraged – some cases of infantile colic may be avoided. With regard to mothers who are not able to give up smoking, the results add some support for the conclusion that if a mother is worried about colic, she certainly should not refrain from breast-feeding even if she smokes.

341,Infant functional regulatory problems and gender moderate bidirectional effects between externalizing behavior and maternal depressive symptoms,"This longitudinal study of 251 families examined bidirectional associations between maternal depressive symptoms and toddler behavioral problems. Functional regulatory problems in infancy and gender were examined as moderators. Mothers rated children’s regulatory problems of crying, feeding, and sleeping in infancy, toddler-age externalizing behavior, and their own depressive symptoms when children were ages 7, 15, and 33 months. Using a structural equation model we found that exposure to maternal depressive symptoms at 7 months predicted high levels of child externalizing behavior at 15 and 33 months. Gender moderated the effect, such that maternal depressive symptoms only predicted boys’ externalizing behavior at 33 months. Toddler-age externalizing behavior predicted high levels of maternal depressive symptoms at 33 months, only among those who had relatively few regulatory problems as infants. Infancy seems to be a period of heightened vulnerability to effects of maternal depression and boys are more likely than girls to develop resulting externalizing problems. Mothers of infants with few regulatory problems may develop worse depressive symptoms in response to their children’s preschool-age behavioral problems.

359,Neonatal CSF oxytocin levels are associated with parent report of infant soothability and sociability,"Oxytocin (OT) has been linked to social behavior in rodents, non-human primates, and adult humans, but almost nothing is known about brain OT activity in human newborns or its impact on social development. To better understand the role of OT biology in human social functioning, a multi-disciplinary, longitudinal study was conducted. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) OT levels from 18 human neonates were evaluated and examined in relationship to social-seeking behavior at term, at 3 months, and at 6 months of age. Higher neonatal CSF OT levels were consistently associated with solicitation of parental soothing and interest in social engagement with others. This is the first study to link CSF OT levels to normative human social functioning. Research is now required to test whether early OT levels serve as a biomarker for subsequent social abnormalities.

38,Developmental effects on sleep–wake patterns in infants receiving a cow’s milk-based infant formula with an added prebiotic blend: a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Few studies have evaluated nutritive effects of prebiotics on infant behavior state, physiology, or metabolic status. Methods: In this double-blind randomized study, infants (n = 161) received cow’s milk-based infant formula (Control) or similar formula with an added prebiotic blend (polydextrose and galactooligosaccharides [PDX/GOS]) from 14–35 to 112 days of age. Infant wake behavior (crying/fussing, awake/content) and 24-h sleep–wake actograms were analyzed (Baseline, Days 70 and 112). Salivary cortisol was immunoassayed (Days 70 and 112). In a subset, exploratory stool 16S ribosomal RNA-sequencing was analyzed (Baseline, Day 112). Results: One hundred and thirty-one infants completed the study. Average duration of crying/fussing episodes was similar at Baseline, significantly shorter for PDX/GOS vs. Control at Day 70, and the trajectory continued at Day 112. Latency to first and second nap was significantly longer for PDX/GOS vs. Control at Day 112. Cortisol awakening response was demonstrated at Days 70 and 112. Significant stool microbiome beta-diversity and individual taxa abundance differences were observed in the PDX/GOS group. Conclusions: Results indicate faster consolidation of daytime waking state in infants receiving prebiotics and support home-based actigraphy to assess early sleep–wake patterns. A prebiotic effect on wake organization is consistent with influence on the gut–brain axis and warrants further investigation. Impact: Few studies have evaluated nutritive effects of prebiotics on infant behavior state, cortisol awakening response, sleep–wake entrainment, and gut microbiome.Faster consolidation of daytime waking state was demonstrated in infants receiving a prebiotic blend in infant formula through ~4 months of age.Shorter episodes of crying were demonstrated at ~2 months of age (time point corresponding to age/developmental range associated with peak crying) in infants receiving formula with added prebiotics.Results support home-based actigraphy as a suitable method to assess early sleep–wake patterns.Prebiotic effect on wake organization is consistent with influence on the gut–brain axis and warrants further investigation. © 2020, The Author(s).","Colombo, J. and Carlson, S.

392,Depression and anger in fathers of unsettled infants: A community cohort study,"Aim: To examine the relationship between unsettled infant behaviour and fathers’ depressive symptoms, cognitions surrounding infant sleep (anger, doubt), and personal sleep, in a community cohort. Methods: Data were collected from 102 fathers of healthy infants at 4 weeks, 4 months and 6 months of age. Measures included father report of infant sleep and crying problems, depressive symptoms, cognitions about infant sleep and own sleep quality and quantity. Data were analysed using adjusted regression models. Results: Sleep problems at 4 months of age were associated with increased depressive symptoms (adjusted mean difference 2.64 (1.27–4.00)), doubt (adjusted mean difference 1.82 (0.40–3.25)), anger (adjusted mean difference 1.86 (0.51–3.20)), poor personal sleep quantity (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.21; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09–0.51) and quality (adjusted OR 0.20; 95% CI 0.08–0.51); and at 6 months of age, with increased depressive symptoms (adjusted mean difference 2.56 (1.28–3.84)), anger (adjusted mean difference 1.63 (0.40–2.87)), poor personal sleep quantity (adjusted OR 0.14; 95% CI 0.05–0.38) and quality (adjusted OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.11–0.72). Infant cry problems at 4 months were associated with increased anger (adjusted mean difference 1.98 (0.60–3.36)) and doubt (adjusted mean difference 1.55 (0.05–3.05)); and at 6 months, with increased depressive symptoms (adjusted mean difference 3.04 (1.59–4.69)), anger (adjusted mean difference 2.73 (1.29–4.17)) and less personal sleep (adjusted OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.07–0.71). Conclusion: Fathers of unsettled infants reported greater anger towards their infant and increased depressive symptoms by 4 months infant age, with these symptoms persisting 2 months later. Evidence‐based interventions are needed for these fathers.

Investigated the relationship of infant and mother characteristics to the development of infant temperament and mother-infant interaction during the 1st 3 mo of life. 56 19-35 yr old mothers and their low-risk newborn infants participated in the research. A maternal questionnaire was administered prenatally and the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale administered in the early postnatal period; mother-infant interaction was observed at 1 and 3 mo. Results indicate that (1) neonatal irritability showed some consistency when time to calm was the criterion; (2) observed fussing and crying was associated not with neonatal irritability, but with unresponsive maternal attitudes and behavior; (3) initial irritability was associated with greater responsiveness to female than to male infants; and (4) by 3 mo, antecedent mother and infant characteristics contributed significantly to the prediction of observed mother behavior. Findings are discussed in terms of a transactional model of development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","Crockenberg, Susan B. and Smith, Perrin",1,1818
42,The Influence of Temperament on Weight Gain in Early Infancy,"Difficult temperament has been associated with fast weight gain and slow weight gain, although the latter mostly in referred subjects studies in late infancy. The current study set out to investigate early weight gain in relation to all domains of temperament in a community-screened sample. Weight gain from birth to 8 weeks was assessed in 75 infants recruited from local health care clinics who had demonstrated slow, average, or fast weight gain. Mothers completed a temperament questionnaire and a 2-day diary recording infant behaviors (sleeping, feeding, fussing, and crying). Weight gain from birth to 8 weeks was significantly related to infant temperament. The temperament dimension fear (acceptance or rejection of new objects or persons) was related to slow weight gain and the temperament dimension distress to limitations (negative emotionality and the infant's reaction to frustrating situations) was related to fast weight gain. The regression model explained 59% of the variance, with the temperament dimensions explaining 11%. Diary data showed that infants who scored high on fear tended to cry a lot, while infants with high scores on distress to limitations tended to sleep less and cry and fuss more. The results emphasize that different temperament domains influence slow and fast weight gain. In addition, the data suggest that infant temperament plays a part in physical development in early infancy.

431,The association of paternal mood and infant temperament: A pilot study,"Maternal depression is associated with adverse child development, but little is known about the effects of paternal depression. This pilot study estimated the prevalence of paternal depression and mood state, and assessed the relationship between paternal mood and infant temperament. The participants in the study were 98 fathers of newborn babies. Fathers were initially screened for depressed mood (Hospital anxiety and depression scale, and Edinburgh postnatal depression scale), and at 6 months parental mood, infant temperament, couple relationship quality, alcohol use, adverse life events, parenting, and demographics were recorded. Infant fussiness was analysed in relation to paternal mood and other contextual factors using multiple regression. Of the 98 fathers, 48 (49%) completed depression-screening measures. Of these 48 fathers, 4 (8%) reported depressive symptoms above the cut-off for case definition. A total of 48% (N = 19) completed measures at follow-up. In the adjusted model, higher paternal depression scores, more traditional attitudes towards fathering, and increased recent life events were related to higher infant fussiness scores; and better couple relationship quality was related to lower fussiness scores. This study showed that I in 12 fathers had depressed mood, and lower mood was associated with negative infant temperament. Since the findings of this feasibility study were based on a small sample size the association of paternal mood and child development merits further study using a larger sample of fathers.

441,Childbirth complications affect young infants' behavior,"Background: The process of childbirth and its complications have been related to the newborn's condition and to development at later ages. In this study, we examine how mode of delivery and delivery complications are related to the behavior and cortisol reactivity of infants during the first 2 months. Methods: Delivery factors (i.e. mode, duration, fetal heart function, and 5-min Apgar score) were determined in 116 healthy, term, first-born infants. The infants' behavioral and cortisol reactivity to stressors were assessed during a physical examination at 11 days and an inoculation at 2 months. Daily behavior at 6 weeks was followed by means of a four-day parental diary. Results: Indicators of a more stressful delivery were linked to more crying/fussing in the infant and to more difficulties in regulating the infants' behavior (i.e., more unsoothability and longer crying bouts). Specific delivery complications rather than mode of delivery were linked to infants' behavior. No significant associations however, were found between childbirth and the infants' cortisol reactivity to a physical examination and an inoculation. Conclusions: Childbirth complications, even when mild, can apparently affect early infant behavior. These effects extend over different types of situations, and last at least until the age of 2 months, and should be taken into account in studies on infant behavior. Earlier findings of relations between childbirth complications and infant cortisol reactivity could not be replicated in this study, possibly due to the confounding effect of parity, and to the important intra-individual variability present in the infants' cortisol.

Study design and subjects are seventeen mothers and their healthy, full-term infants participated in this prospective, longitudinal study. The mothers' cortisol was determined in late pregnancy. The infants' behavior was videotaped during a series of bath sessions at the home: at 1, 3, 5, 7, 18 and 20 weeks of age. The mothers filled in temperament questionnaires (ICQ) in postnatal weeks 7 and 18. The infants were divided into two groups based on their mothers' late pregnancy cortisol values: high and low prenatal cortisol groups. A trend was found for the high cortisol infants to be delivered earlier than the low cortisol group. Furthermore, the behavioral observations showed the higher prenatal cortisol group to display more crying, fussing and negative facial expressions. Supporting these findings, maternal reports on temperament also showed these infants to have more difficult behavior: they had higher scores on emotion and activity. The differences between the infants were strongest at the youngest ages (weeks 1-7).

471,Intrinsic and extrinsic factors associated with night waking in 9-month-old infants,"This study examined relations between infant night waking and both daytime behaviors reflective of poor behavioral and emotional regulation (intrinsic factors) and parent behaviors that may contribute to infant night waking (extrinsic factors) in 41 infants. Mothers completed questionnaires and an infant sleep and crying diary. More time awake at night was related to separation distress, frequent daytime crying, dysregulation, co-sleeping with parents, breast feeding, and being put to bed asleep. More frequent waking was related to separation distress, frequent daytime crying, co-sleeping, and breast feeding. The combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors predicted night waking better than behaviors from one category alone. Implications for parenting are discussed.

4810,"Prepartum, postpartum and chronic depression effects on neonatal behavior","Eighty pregnant women were assessed for depression during mid-pregnancy (Mean gestational age = 25.9 weeks) and shortly after delivery in order to assess the effects of the onset and chronicity of maternal depression on neonatal behavior. The women were classified as reporting depressive symptoms: (1) only during the prepartum assessment; (2) only during the postpartum assessment; (3) during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments; or (4) reporting no depressive symptoms at either the prepartum or the postpartum assessment. Neonates born to mothers reporting symptoms of depression at any time point exhibited greater indeterminate sleep than neonates of non-depressed mothers. Neonates born to mothers reporting prenatal depression spent more time fussing and crying and exhibited more stress behaviors than neonates born to non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression only during the postpartum assessment. Finally, neonates born to mothers exhibiting symptoms of depression during both the prepartum and postpartum assessments exhibited less optimal Brazelton neurobehavioral assessment scores than neonates of non-depressed mothers or neonates born to mothers who exhibited symptoms of depression during only the prepartum or only during the postpartum assessments. Taken together these findings suggest that neonatal behavior is influenced not just by the presence but also by the timing and duration of maternal depression symptoms.

522,Interrelations between communicative behaviors at the outset of speech: Parents as observers,"The Hebrew Parent Questionnaire for Communication and Early Language (HPQ-CEL) was administered by 154 parents of Hebrew-speaking toddlers aged 1 ; 0 to 1 ; 3 (77 boys, 77 girls). The Questionnaire guided parents in observing and rating their toddlers in six contexts at home. The study aimed to identify inter-correlations between toddlers' non-linguistic behaviors that co-occur during the transition to speech. Seven communicative behaviors were extracted from the questionnaire data: Crying, Vocalizations, Collaboration with Adults, Pointing, Words, Joint Engagement in a Peek-a-Boo Game, and Triadic Interaction in Book Reading. Collaboration with Adults and Triadic Interaction in Book Reading yielded more significant correlations than other prelinguistic behaviors. Participation in social games and book-reading activities was associated with the toddlers' number of words at the period studied.

551,Temperament and behaviour of infants aged 4–12 months on admission to a private mother-baby unit and at 1- and 6-month follow-up,"While infant behaviour is influenced by maternal care, infant crying and dysregulated sleep can reciprocally affect maternal mood. The temperament and behaviour of two 4–12-months-old infant cohorts admitted with their mothers to a residential parenting program were examined using behaviour charts and the Short Infant Temperament Questionnaire (SITQ). One group was re-assessed one and six months later. Infant temperament was significantly more difficult than population norms and most had dysregulated sleep. One month after treatment, total infant crying and fussing, frequency of night-time waking, and sleep and feeding dysregulation were significantly (p<.001) reduced, with change sustained at six months. Easy-Difficult scores (SITQ) were stable and significantly worse than population norms. The contribution of a “difficult” infant temperament to maternal mood disorder warrants further investigation. 2004 Australian Psychological Society","Fisher, J. and Rowe, H. and Feekery, C.",1,1826
58,Modifications of Systematic Ignoring in the Management of Infant Sleep Disturbance: Efficacy and Infant Distress,"Systematic ignoring and two modifications of it (systematic ignoring with minimal parental check and systematic ignoring with parental presence) were evaluated for treatment of Infant Sleep Disturbance (ISD). Fifteen infants (6-15 months of age) participated in a study utilising a multiple-baseline design across the three treatment programs. Frequency of awakening and duration of crying were measured in order to evaluate treatment efficacy and infant distress. All programs led to decreases in night waking but infants treated with systematic ignoring with minimal check woke and cried more over the treatment period. Given our present knowledge, the parental presence program appears to be the treatment of choice. This result needs further investigation, as do those of other programs commonly used to treat Infant Sleep Disturbance (ISD) in infants.

5910,Infant distress at five weeks of age and caregiver frustration,"Objective: To investigate the differential association of three modes (fussing, crying, unsoothable crying) and three properties (duration/day, frequency/day, maximum bout length) of infant distress with daily caregiver frustration. Study design: Replicated cross-sectional studies were completed in Vancouver, British Columbia (n = 1065) and Seattle, Washington (n = 1857). Infant fussing, crying, and unsoothable crying and caregiver frustration were measured daily for 4 days at 5 weeks of age by the Baby’s Day Diary. Generalized estimating equation models were used to predict caregiver frustration from nine measurements of distress. Results: In Vancouver, measurements of distress significantly associated with caregiver frustration in decreasing order of magnitude were as follow: (1) maximum bout length of unsoothable crying; (2) duration/day of crying; and (3) frequency of unsoothable crying and duration/day of fussing. In Seattle, associated measurements of distress were: (1) maximum bout length of unsoothable crying; (2) maximum bout length and duration/day of crying, frequency of unsoothable crying, and duration/day of fussing; and (3) frequency/day of crying. Conclusions: Daily caregiver frustration is associated differentially with different modes and properties of infant distress. Specifically, maximum bout length of unsoothable crying was most strongly related in both sites. Additionally, frequency/day of unsoothable crying and duration/day of crying and of fussing were significantly associated at both sites.

603,Effectiveness of an educational video in maternity wards to prevent self-reported shaking and smothering during the first week of age: A cluster randomized controlled trial,"AbstractThis study aimed to investigate whether watching an educational video on infant crying and the dangers of shaking and smothering within 1 week after delivery at maternity wards reduces self-reported shaking and smothering, at a 1-month health checkup. A cluster randomized controlled trial, stratified by area and hospital function, was employed in 45 obstetrics hospitals/clinics in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. In the intervention group, mothers watched an educational video on infant crying and the dangers of shaking and smothering an infant, within 1 week of age, during hospitalization at maternity wards, without blinding on group allocation. Control group received usual care. A total of 4722 (N = 2350 and 2372 for intervention and control group, respectively) mothers who delivered their babies (still birth and gestational age < 22 weeks were excluded) between October 1, 2014, and January 31 were recruited. Outcomes were self-reported shaking and smothering behaviors, knowledge on infant crying and shaking, and behaviors to cope with infant crying, assessed via a questionnaire at a 1-month health checkup. In all, 2718 (N = 1078 and 1640) responded to the questionnaire (response rate: 58.3%), and analytic sample size was 2655 (N = 1058 and 1597 for intervention and control group, respectively). Multilevel analysis was used to adjust for correlation within the cluster. Prevalence of shaking was significantly lower in the intervention group (0.19%) than in the control group (1.69%). Intention-to-treat analysis showed an 89% reduction in the reported prevalence of self-reported shaking (OR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02–0.53) due to watching the educational video. However, self-reported smothering behavior showed no significant reduction (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.27–1.60). No side effects were reported. Watching an educational video on infant crying and the dangers of shaking and smothering within 1 week after delivery at maternity wards reduced self-reported shaking at 1 month of age.

61,Effectiveness of educational materials designed to change knowledge and behavior about crying and shaken baby syndrome: A replication of a randomized controlled trial in Japan,"Objectives: Infant crying is particularly frustrating to caregivers in the first few months of life and the most common trigger for shaking and abuse. The effectiveness of the Period of PURPLE Crying prevention materials (DVD and booklet) designed to increase knowledge and change behaviors related to crying and the dangers of shaking was reported in North America. The aim of this study was to replicate the effectiveness of the PURPLE materials with mothers of newborns in Japan. Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, 201 parents received either PURPLE materials or analogous control materials on infant safety via mail within 2 weeks of birth. At 6 weeks, mothers completed a 4-day behavioral diary. At 2 months, participants completed a predefined 20-min structured telephone survey by an independent firm to assess knowledge and behavior. Results: Scores on crying knowledge scales (out of 100) were significantly higher in the intervention than control groups (56.1 vs. 53.1; difference = 3.0, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0–4.9, p < 0.005). Percentage of sharing of advice to walk away if frustrated by crying was significantly higher in the intervention than control groups (22.4% vs. 4.1%; difference=18%, 95% CI: 7.4–29.1). Walking away during unsoothable crying was significantly higher in the intervention group than controls (0.085 vs. 0.017 events per day, rate ratio = 4.8, 95% CI: 1.1–21.2) by diary. Self-talk behavior scale (out of 100) tended to significance in the intervention group (16.6 vs. 8.9, difference = 7.7, 95% CI: −1.0 to 16.4, p < 0.1). Conclusions: Crying knowledge, sharing of walk away information with others and walk away behavior when crying was unsoothable were higher for those who received intervention than control materials. The Period of PURPLE Crying materials may be useful in Japan as well as in North America for informing caregivers about the properties of infant crying and changing some behaviors related to infant crying and shaking.

62,Identifying risk factors for postpartum tobacco use,"Purpose: To identify factors associated with becoming a mother that may contribute to postpartum smoking-related outcomes. Design: Cross-sectional, correlational. Methods: Postpartum women (N = 133) who were clients in a nutrition supplement program for low-income families responded to questionnaires about smoking and early motherhood experiences. Inferential statistical tests included hierarchical multiple and logistic regression. Findings: After controlling for factors known to be associated with smoking outcomes for the general population, factors associated with becoming a mother significantly contributed to the amount of explained variance in both postpartum self-efficacy to refrain from smoking and smoking within 2 weeks after delivery. Conclusions: Study findings indicated that prenatal intentions about postpartum tobacco use and maternal response to infant cry episodes were areas for risk assessment that might lead to effective smoking cessation interventions uniquely tailored to women who experience becoming a mother.

631,It takes two: Infants’ moderate negative reactivity and maternal sensitivity predict self-regulation in the preschool years,"The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine the association of infant fussing and crying with self-regulation in toddlerhood and the preschool years, as well as the moderating role of maternal sensitivity therein. When children ( n = 149, 53.69% boys) were 6 months old, parents reported on their fussing and crying using a cry diary, and maternal sensitivity was coded during a novel toy procedure. Children participated in various tasks to assess self-regulation in toddlerhood (18 months) and the preschool years (4.5 years). Results indicated that the relation between infant fussing and preschool self-regulation took the shape of an inverted U, but only for children of highly sensitive mothers. For infants of less sensitive mothers, fussing was not related to later self-regulation. Crying was unrelated to preschool self-regulation. Neither fussing, crying, nor maternal sensitivity predicted self-regulation in toddlerhood. The findings support the optimal arousal theory, by demonstrating that for infants of highly sensitive mothers, moderate amounts of low intensity negative reactivity are associated with enhanced self-regulation in the preschool years.

65,Maternal vitamin B-12 and folate status during pregnancy and excessive infant crying,"Background: The etiology of excessive infant crying is largely unknown. We hypothesize that excessive infant crying may have an early nutritional origin during fetal development. Aims: This study is the first to explore whether (1) maternal vitamin B-12 and folate status during pregnancy are associated with excessive infant crying, and (2) whether and how maternal psychological well-being during pregnancy affects these associations. Study design: Women were approached around the 12th pregnancy week to complete a questionnaire (n=8266) and to donate a blood sample (n=4389); vitamin B-12 and folate concentrations were determined in serum. Infant crying behavior was measured through a postpartum questionnaire (±3months; n=5218). Subjects: Pregnant women living in Amsterdam and their newborn child. Outcome measures: Excessive infant crying, defined as crying ≥3h/day on average in the past week. Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed for 2921 (vitamin B-12) and 2622 (folate) women. Vitamin B-12 concentration (categorized into quintiles) was associated with excessive infant crying after adjustment for maternal age, parity, ethnicity, education, maternal smoking and psychological problems (OR[95%CI]: Q1=3.31[1.48–7.41]; Q2=2.50[1.08–5.77]; Q3=2.59[1.12–6.00]; Q4=2.77[1.20–6.40]; Q5 = reference). Stratified analysis suggested a stronger association among women with high levels of psychological problems during pregnancy. Folate concentration was not associated with excessive infant crying. Conclusions: First evidence is provided for an early nutritional origin in excessive infant crying. A low maternal vitamin B-12 status during pregnancy could, in theory, affect infant crying behavior through two potential mechanisms: the methionine–homocysteine metabolism and/or the maturation of the sleep–wake rhythm.

681,A 6-month study of postpartum depression and related factors in Athens Greece,"Introduction: Postpartum depression (PPD) affects women in various sociocultural environments around the world during a sensitive period of their lives. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and time course of PPD in a Greek urban environment as well as possible relations of PPD with certain clinical and sociodemographic factors. Method: The study was performed on a sample of 402 women that were recruited from a university obstetric clinic in Athens, Greece, during the first 24 hours after delivery. The women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale through telephone interviews. The telephone interviews were conducted the first week as well as the first, third, and sixth month after delivery. The first day after delivery, all women completed the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the List of Threatening Experience, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Whitley Index, the Schalling-Sifneos Personality Scale, and the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory. In addition, the Blues Questionnaire was administered the first 3 days and the seventh day after delivery. Other clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained through questionnaires and personal interviews. Results: A cutoff point of 12 in the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to define PPD. Eighty (19.8%) of the women in the sample experienced PPD during the first 6 months after delivery. The development of PPD was related significantly to the following factors: stressful events during pregnancy ( P = .01), maternity blues on the seventh day after delivery ( P = .01), obsessive preoccupation with cleaning ( P = .04), and judgment that the baby is crying excessively at the first month interview ( P = .02). Conclusion: The women's emotional condition before and after delivery, obsessionality, and difficulties in regulating the infant's emotions appear to contribute to the development of PPD during the first 6 months after delivery.

70,Maternal prenatal depression predicts infant negative affect via maternal inflammatory cytokine levels,"Maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy are associated with risk for offspring emotional and behavioral problems, but the mechanisms by which this association occurs are not known. Infant elevated negative affect (increased crying, irritability, fearfulness, etc.) is a key risk factor for future psychopathology, so understanding its determinants has prevention and early intervention potential. An understudied yet promising hypothesis is that maternal mood affects infant mood via maternal prenatal inflammatory mechanisms, but this has not been prospectively examined in humans. Using data from a pilot study of women followed from the second trimester of pregnancy through six months postpartum ( N = 68) our goal was to initiate a prospective study as to whether maternal inflammatory cytokines mediate the association between maternal depressive symptoms and infant offspring negative affect. The study sample was designed to examine a broad range of likely self-regulation and mood-regulation problems in offspring; to that end we over-selected women with a family history or their own history of elevated symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Results supported the hypothesis: maternal pro-inflammatory cytokines during the third trimester (indexed using a latent variable that included plasma interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 concentrations as indicators) mediated the effect, such that higher maternal depressive symptoms were associated with higher maternal inflammation, and this mediated the effect on maternal report of infant negative affect (controlling for maternal affect during the infant period). This is the first human study to demonstrate that maternal inflammatory cytokines mediate the association between prenatal depression and infant outcomes, and the first to demonstrate a biological mechanism through which depressive symptoms impact infant temperament.

717,The relationship between daytime exposure to light and night-time sleep in 6-12-week-old infants,"This project investigated the relationship between exposure to light and 24-h patterns of sleep and crying in young, healthy, full-term babies living at home and following a normal domestic routine. Measures included an ankle worn activity monitor, an external light monitor and the Barr Baby Day Diary in which parents recorded periods of sleep, crying, feeding and other behaviours at 5-min intervals throughout the 24-h period. Fifty-six babies (26 males and 30 females) were monitored across three consecutive days at 6, 9 and 12 weeks of age. There was an early evening peak in crying which was associated with reduced sleep at 6 weeks. Across the trials there was a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of sleep occurring at night. Sleeping well at 6 weeks was a good indication of more night-time sleep at 9 and 12 weeks. Babies who slept well at night were exposed to significantly more light in the early afternoon period. These data suggest that light in the normal domestic setting influences the development of the circadian system.

733,Are cortisol concentrations in human breast milk associated with infant crying?,"The present longitudinal study is the first to investigate the association between human breast milk cortisol and infant crying over the first three months of life. Higher concentrations of breast milk cortisol were expected to be differentially associated with fussing and crying in boys and girls. At 2, 6, and 12 weeks of infant age, mothers ( N = 70) collected a morning sample of their milk and kept a 3‐day diary to measure infant fussing and crying. Cortisol was extracted and quantified from milk samples. Results showed that breast milk cortisol concentrations increased from 2 weeks through 12 weeks of infant age. Milk cortisol was unrelated to the total duration, frequency, and bout length of infant fussing and crying for both boys and girls. Directions for future research aiming to extend our knowledge on the biology of milk cortisol in relation to infant behavior and development are discussed.

Forty-four mother-infant pairs participated in this study. For three consecutive nights at home, babies were observed in their cribs using a digital video system. Mothers reported on their nighttime interactions with their babies using a self-report diary and completed a questionnaire regarding child temperament. Attachment was assessed in the Strange Situation (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978). Mothers of securely attached infants had nighttime interactions that were generally more consistent, sensitive and responsive than those of insecurely attached infants. Specifically, in secure dyads, mothers generally picked up and soothed infants when they fussed or cried after an awakening.

Methods: Randomized controlled trial with 781 infants born at 32 weeks or later in 42 well-child centers, Melbourne, Australia. Follow-up occurred at infant age 4 and 6 months. The intervention including supplying information about normal infant sleep and cry patterns, settling techniques, medical causes of crying and parent self-care, delivered via booklet and DVD (at infant age 4 weeks), telephone consultation (8 weeks), and parent group (13 weeks) versus well-child care. Outcomes included caregiver-reported infant night sleep problem (primary outcome), infant daytime sleep, cry and feeding problems, crying and sleep duration, caregiver depression symptoms, attendance at night wakings, and formula changes. Results: Infant outcomes were similar between groups. Relative to control caregivers, intervention caregivers at 6 months were less likely to score >9 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (7.9%, vs 12.9%, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34 to 0.94), spend >20 minutes attending infant wakings (41% vs 51%, adjusted OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.95), or change formula (13% vs 23%, P < .05). Infant frequent feeders (.11 feeds/24 hours) in the intervention group were less likely to have daytime sleep (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.54) or cry problems (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.86) at 4 months. Conclusions: An education program reduces postnatal depression symptoms, as well as sleep and cry problems in infants who are frequent feeders. The program may be best targeted to frequent feeders.

804,"Newborn Behavioral Observation, maternal stress, depressive symptoms and the mother-infant relationship: Results from the Northern Babies Longitudinal Study (NorBaby)","Background: Families can experience the postpartum period as overwhelming and many report a special need for support. The Newborn Behavioral Observation (NBO) aims to promote a positive parent-infant relationship by sensitising parents to the infant’s signals. This article evaluates the NBO as a universal preventive intervention within the regular well-baby clinic service on measures of maternal depressive symptoms, parental stress, the mother-infant relationship and satisfaction/benefit of the postpartum follow-up. Methods: This investigation is part of a larger longitudinal study comprising 220 women and 130 of their partners recruited between 2015 and 2017. The study had a non-randomised cluster-controlled design with 6 measurement points. This article is based on a sample of 196 women using data from T1 (gestational weeks 13–39), T4 (5–15 weeks postpartum) and T5 (3–9 months postpartum). Participants were allocated to a group receiving the NBO ( n = 82) and a care as usual comparison group ( n = 114). We measured maternal depressive symptoms and parental stress using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI). The mother-infant relationship was assessed with the Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ), the Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS) and the Maternal Confidence Questionnaire (MCQ). Participants also answered questions about satisfaction/benefit of the postpartum follow-up. Results: A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that participants in the NBO-group learned significantly more than the comparison group from the follow-up about the baby’s signals in relation to sleep/sleep patterns, social interaction and crying/fuzziness. Multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) and repeated measures ANCOVA found no significant differences between the groups for the mother-infant relationship domain and few differences in depressive symptoms and parental stress. The repeated measures ANCOVA found that participants in the NBO-group scored slightly higher on parental stress, although the difference was small. Conclusions: The results indicate that the NBO-group learned more than the comparison group about reading their child’s signals in important everyday situations. However, the benefits of the NBO were limited for depressive symptoms, parental stress and self-reported mother-infant relationship. The study sample was generally well-functioning, and the results indicate that the benefits of the NBO may be limited within a well-functioning sample.

81,Real-World Implementation of Infant Behavioral Sleep Interventions: Results of a Parental Survey,"OBJECTIVE: To describe parental practices implementing behavioral sleep intervention (BSI) outside a clinical setting. STUDY DESIGN: Parents (n = 652), recruited through a Facebook group designed as a peer support group for parents using BSI, completed an online survey about their experience using BSI with their infant or toddler. RESULTS: On average, parents implemented BSI when their infant was 5.6 (±2.77) months. Parents most often used modified (49.5%) or unmodified extinction (34.9%), with fewer using a parental presence approach (15.6%). Regardless of BSI type, more parents endorsed ""a great deal of stress"" during the first night (42.2%) than 1 week later (5.2%). The duration of infant crying was typically greatest the first night (reported by 45%; M = 43 minutes) and was significantly reduced after 1 week (M = 8.54 minutes). Successful implementation of BSI on the first attempt was reported by 83%, with a median and mode of 7 days until completion (79% by 2 weeks). Regardless of BSI type, after intervention parents reported their infant had less difficulty falling asleep, fewer night awakenings, and were more likely to sleep in their room and/or in their own crib/bed. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of parents report successfully implementing BSI, with significantly reduced infant crying by the end of 1 week and success within 2 weeks. Few differences were found between behavioral approaches.","Honaker, S. M. and Schwichtenberg, A. J. and Kreps, T. A. and Mindell, J. A.",1,1841
825,Parental responses to infant crying and colic: The effect on breastfeeding duration,"Context: Infant crying can cause parental distress, and colic is associated with low maternal self-efficacy and heightened risk for depression. Breastfeeding is recognized as an effective method of calming infants, but the relationship of colic and the use of breastfeeding to remedy infant crying have not been tested for any effects on breastfeeding duration. Objective: To evaluate the effects of infant colic (colic analysis) and breastfeeding as a method of infant calming (calming analysis) on breastfeeding duration. Design: The authors followed 700 healthy breastfeeding mother–baby dyads from birth to 1 year. Maternal interviews were conducted postpartum, and at 2, 5, 10, 16, 24, 38, and 52 weeks to ascertain demographic factors, infant crying patterns, comforting practices, physician-diagnosed colic, and breastfeeding behaviors. Cox survival analyses were used to evaluate the independent effects of: (a) physician diagnosed colic; and (b) breastfeeding as a comforting practice on breastfeeding duration. Data from all 700 breastfeeding dyads were used in the colic analyses. In the calming analyses, to assure that breastfeeding was appropriately established, data were used from the 617 couplets that had breastfed for at least 2 weeks. Using a stepwise process, models, adjusted for typical predictors of breastfeeding duration, were developed for exclusive, full and partial breastfeeding duration. Variables of interest (i.e., colic diagnosis, breastfeeding for comfort) were then forced into the baseline models to determine any independent effects. Results: In the first 16 weeks, parents found that holding (87%), breastfeeding (82%), walking (67%), and rocking (63%) were highly effective calming practices. Mothers who rated breastfeeding as highly effective had a higher frequency of breastfeeding at all contacts (p < 0.05). In adjusted analyses the use of breastfeeding to comfort infants was a significant predictor of longer partial (overall) ([hazard ratio] HR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4 to 0.9; p = 0.02) but not exclusive or full breastfeeding duration. By 6 months, 44 mothers (6.3%) reported a diagnosis of colic. Mothers of infants with a diagnosis of colic were less likely to report breastfeeding as effective method of infant comforting (p = 0.03). In adjusted analyses the authors found that a diagnosis of colic predicted shorter full breastfeeding duration (HR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.4 to 4.2; p = 0.001) but not exclusive or partial duration. Conclusions: Breastfeeding to comfort a crying infant is a strong predictor of partial (overall) duration and is rated as a highly effective calming method by parents. These data suggest that parents may benefit from education about normal infant crying patterns and effective methods of infant comforting, including breastfeeding. However, mothers of infants diagnosed with colic are at risk for shortened duration of full breastfeeding. Although the reasons for this are unclear, it may be helpful to specifically address the subject of colic and infant feeding and encourage mothers to fully breastfeed for the recommended 6 months.

841,Cradling in the Prevention of Excessive Crying and Colic Symptoms in Infants,"To evaluate lying in a cradle in the prevention of excessive infant crying or colic symptoms, and to investigate potential protective or risk factors for the phenomenon, 220 newborns were randomized to sleep either in a bed or cot (control group, N = 108) or in a cradle (cradle group, N = 112). During three months, the parents filled in diaries on the sleeping place most used and the amount of crying of their infants. Three infants in the cradle group and one control fulfilled the criteria of colic. The percentages of extremely weepy infants (25.7% vs 24.4%) and the intensity of crying did not differ between the groups. Medication for colic symptoms was used equally frequently in both groups. A high educational (OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.01; 10.04) and socioeconomic (OR 3.76, 95% CI 1.34; 10.52) level of the family and having a sibling with a history of colic (OR 6.46, 95% CI 1.17; 35.73) were predictors for the infant being weepy. Absence of nursing problems and having no sibling with a history of colic seemed to be related with a low amount of crying. Excessive infant crying was less common in families with unemployed fathers compared to those in which the father had an occupation (p = 0.018). Cradling seems not to prevent excessive crying or colic symptoms in infants. Breast-feeding guidance during rooming-in period and presence of father or another adult supporter at home might be preventive means against excessive crying.

897,Maternal Regulation of Infant Reactivity From 2 to 6 Months,"Previous research has investigated the effect of maternal soothing behaviors on reducing infant reactivity but not the differential effects of specific maternal behaviors on infant stress responses. The present study investigated maternal regulation of 2- and 6-month-olds' responses to an inoculation and found a significant decline with age in both the intensity and duration of infants' crying. Maternal affection and touching decreased from 2 to 6 months, whereas maternal vocalizing and distraction behaviors increased. At both ages, the combination of maternal holding/rocking and vocalizing was associated with decreases in all levels of infant reactivity. Neither strategy alone, however, was found to be effective. Feeding/ pacifying behaviors were effective only when initial distress was at a low or moderate level, which suggests that the effectiveness of maternal regulatory behaviors may depend on the intensity of infants' crying.

91,Individual differences in responsivity to a neurobehavioural examination predict crying patterns of 1-week-old infants at home,"Unexplained crying in infants aged 1 to 3 months is a common concern for Western parents and health services. This study examined the hypothesis that the crying is due to high infant responsivity, and provides evidence about the types of stimulation that trigger crying in infants who present with high responsivity. The sample included 93 eight-day-old infants from a community sample (47 females, 46 males; mean birthweight 3457g; mean gestation 39.4 weeks; mean Apgar scores 8.28 at 1 minute and 9.59 at 5 minutes). Infants were tested for their response to two standard, mildly challenging, procedures: a neurobehavioural test involving undressing, putting down, and handling, and the Guthrie test, involving a painful heel prick to obtain a blood sample. The infants' crying over 24 hours was recorded in parental diaries. Newborn infants who exhibited high responsivity during the neurobehavioural assessment cried, rather than fussed, the most at home. High responsivity during the neurobehavioural assessment also predicted those infants who cried a lot and met a definition of 'colic' at home. The findings support the responsivity hypothesis and show that infants with high responsivity are upset by undressing, putting down, and sustained handling.

931,"Investigating the biographic, social and temperamental correlates of young infants’ sleeping, crying and feeding routines","The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on feeding, sleeping and crying routines in infants aged between 4 and 10 weeks. Seventy-nine child–parent dyads from the North East of England participated in this cross-sectional study. Data on infant feeding, sleeping and crying routines was collected by parental diaries for a minimum of three days over the period of a week. Biographic data including age, birth-order, and sex and feeding method was collected by questionnaire and temperament was assessed using the Early Infancy Temperament Questionnaire. First-born infants were found to have longer feed duration and shorter nap and total sleep durations than subsequent infants. In addition, more positive temperament ratings tend to be related to greater total sleep duration. Breast-feeding and sex were related to more frequent waking and breast-feeding associated with more frequent feeding episodes. Age was associated with cry frequency. None of the independent variables used in the current analyses were related to infant cry duration. The results support previous findings but add to the current literature by showing that temperament and parity also have an effect on infant routines.

Three measures of crying (episode frequency, mean episode duration, and total episode duration) were measured using a 24-hr maternal diary and contemporaneous audiotaping. Data indicate that the 18 clinic-referred babies cried more frequently and for a longer total episode duration than did their 14 nonreferred peers.

Fifty-seven Finnish low-risk mothers' sensitivity behavior was assessed by the Parent-Child Early Relational Assessment method. Infant's crying behavior was assessed by the Baby's Day Record and by the Crying Patterns Questionnaire. The Social Support Questionnaires (SSQ 1 and 2) were used to evaluate mother's experienced difficulties and support. The infants of More Sensitive (MS) mothers were more contented than those with Less Sensitive (LS) mothers. The MS mothers experienced fewer difficulties with their infants and experienced more support from their best friend and their husband than LS mothers. In addition, some gender differences were found concerning infant behavior.

10010,Antenatal mother–infant bonding scores are related to maternal reports of infant crying behaviour,"Objective: To assess the relation between antenatal mother–infant bonding scores and maternal reports of infant crying behaviour. Background: Crying is normal behaviour and it is important for parent–infant bonding. Even though bonding starts antenatally, the relation between antenatal bonding scores and infant crying behaviour has never been studied. Method: A secondary analysis was performed on data that were gathered in a large prospective study within our region. Bonding was assessed using an antenatal bonding questionnaire at 32 weeks gestational age. The crying behaviour of infants was assessed with three questions at six weeks postpartum. Crying was termed excessive (EC+) when mothers perceived the crying to be ‘every day’, ‘often’ or ‘very often’, and with ‘crying episodes lasting more than 30 minutes’; in other words, when mothers scored high on all three questions. The relation between bonding and crying was examined using a multiple logistic regression analysis, including adjustment for relevant variables, especially maternal depression as measured with the Edinburgh Depression Scale. Results: In total, 894 women were included of whom 47 reported EC + infants (5.3%). Antenatal bonding scores were significantly related to the reporting of crying behaviour, even after adjustment for relevant variables ( p = 0.02). Each extra point on the bonding scale reduced the EC+ risk with 14% (OR = 0.86, 95% CI [0.76–0.97]). Conclusion: Mothers with lower antenatal bonding scores were more likely to report an EC+ infant. Future research should further explore the concept of antenatal bonding, its relation with EC and risks associated with EC.

1011,Mother-infant interaction is influenced by the amount of holding in preterm infants,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate associations between infant crying, holding and mother-infant interaction. Methods: The study groups included 30 firstborn Finnish preterm infants (<1501 g or <32 weeks), and their 36 full-term controls. Caregiver's holding and infant's crying behavior was assessed using Baby Day Diary at 5 months of corrected age. The quality of mother-infant interaction was assessed using PC-ERA at 6 and 12 months of corrected age. Results: The results showed that longer duration of holding in home environment was associated with better quality of mother-infant interaction at 6 and 12 months of corrected age in preterm infants. Preterm infants cried more often and were held more than full-term infants. The frequency of crying was associated with the duration of holding in preterm infants. Mother-infant interaction was comparable between the groups of preterm and full-term infants. Conclusions: Our results underline the importance of caregiver's physical closeness for the quality of the mother-infant interaction in preterm infants. Prematurity itself does not necessary affect the quality of mother-infants interaction in a non-risk population.

10510,Improving our understanding of the colicky infant: A prospective observational study,"Aim: To investigate characteristics differentially associated with infants suffering from colicky-crying vs. other infants. Background: The crying baby is the most common presentation in every clinician’s office in the first 16 weeks of life. As little agreement exists in the literature, attempts to establish differential diagnosis, aetiology, incidence, risk factors and natural progression in addition to appropriate intervention guidelines are urgently needed. Design: Prospective observational study. Subjects: Infants ≤12 months, 159 colicky and 27 non-colicky infants ( n = 186) from whom complete data sets were collected. Methods: Parents of infants presented to the clinic completed questionnaires of their infant’s characteristics. The data were analysed using logistic regression. Results: Symptoms supporting the diagnosis of colicky-crying infants included ‘child flexes/curls legs’, ‘child has difficulty/discomfort on bowel movement’, ‘child is more irritable postfeeding’, ‘child is more irritable when put into cot’, ‘child appears in pain’, ‘child wants frequent cuddling’, ‘family allergy/asthma’ and ‘child changes from happy to crying in an instant’. A nomogram illustrated if a mother suggests colic as a diagnosis and the infant has the symptoms supporting the diagnosis, then the chances of being a colicky infant rise from the initial prevalence 85% to approximately 98%. If the symptoms are not present, the chances of being a colicky infant drop from 85% to around 3%. Conclusion: Because the literature lacks consensus regarding a gold standard for the diagnosis of the colicky-crying infant, these findings may offer help to the health care practitioner when faced with an excessively crying infant. Relevance to clinical practice: It has been hypothesised that there may be multiple reasons for excessive crying in an infant. It is necessary to differentiate between the types of crying infants that present to the clinician to determine the best course of action.

1069,Electronic and paper diary recording of infant and caregiver behaviors,"Objectives: To assess (1) preference of parental use of an electronic diary (e-diary) over a paper diary to record continuous infant and caregiver behaviors over 7 days; (2) whether e-diary recordings would differ in systematic ways from those obtained by paper diaries, and (3) frequency of diary entries when parents provide entries when convenient. Methods: Mothers of normal newborns were randomized at 5 weeks infant age to a paper diary first (n = 34) or e-diary first (n = 35) group. With 3 days between, mothers completed 7-day recordings on both the paper Baby’s Day Diary and an analogous personal digital assistant e-diary for infant (sleep, awake alert, feeding, fussing, crying, inconsolable crying) and caregiver (carrying/ holding, moving) behaviors, and completed post diary ease-of-use ratings and post study preference ratings. Results: Mothers found e-diaries less bothersome but similarly disruptive and enjoyable to paper diaries. At study end, more found e-diaries easier to use, less bothersome and more efficient. E-diary behaviors were consistently more frequent, but rarely different in duration, then paper diary behaviors. Time-stamped e-diary entries (1) generally declined across weeks, (2) were higher if e-diaries were used first, and (3) settled at a modal 2 to 3 entries/day by the second week. Conclusions: For behavioral recording of infant and caregiver behaviors, mothers generally expressed more approval for e-diaries than paper diaries, but neither was considered onerous. E-diaries consistently report more frequent but similar durations of behaviors. If recording when convenient, daily diary entries trend toward 2 to 3 entries a day. The e-diary results provide convergent evidence that paper diary recordings of common infant and caregiver behavior durations provide good estimates of durations, but that behavioral frequencies may be underestimated.

1213,Maternal self-confidence during the first four months postpartum and its association with anxiety and early infant regulatory problems,"Maternal self-confidence has become an essential concept in understanding early disturbances in the mother-child relationship. Recent research suggests that maternal self-confidence may be associated with maternal mental health and infant development. The current study investigated the dynamics of maternal self-confidence during the first four months postpartum and the predictive ability of maternal symptoms of depression, anxiety, and early regulatory problems in infants. Questionnaires assessing symptoms of depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), and early regulatory problems (Questionnaire for crying, sleeping and feeding) were completed in a sample of 130 women at three different time points (third trimester (T1), first week postpartum (T2), and 4 months postpartum (T3). Maternal self-confidence increased significantly over time. High maternal trait anxiety and early infant regulatory problems negatively contributed to the prediction of maternal self-confidence, explaining 31.8% of the variance ( R = .583, F 3,96 = 15.950, p < .001). Our results emphasize the transactional association between maternal self-confidence, regulatory problems in infants, and maternal mental distress. There is an urgent need for appropriate programs to reduce maternal anxiety and to promote maternal self-confidence in order to prevent early regulatory problems in infants.

123,"Effects of infant and maternal sensory processing on infant fussing, crying, and sleep","This study investigated the effects of infant and maternal sensory processing on sleep, fussing, and crying in a sample of 55 firstborn, 4‐ to 7‐month‐old infants and their mothers. Mothers completed self‐report questionnaires to assess maternal and infant sensory processing styles and a 4‐day diary of infant behavior, including sleep, fussing, and crying. Higher levels of infant Sensation Avoiding were associated with less sleep, more fussing, and more crying whereas higher levels of Sensory Sensitivity were associated with less sleep and more fussing. The positive association between infant Sensation Avoiding and crying was strengthened by lower levels of Low Registration in mothers. The effect of infant Sensory Sensitivity on reducing total sleep also was strengthened by lower levels of maternal Low Registration. Assessment of infant sensory processing as well as the moderating effect of maternal sensory processing on the relationship between infant sensory processing and infant regulatory capacities need to be considered when assessing and designing interventions for families in which infant regulation is problematic.

Control variables are parents' insomnia and parental self-efficacy in handling the baby. Questionnaires were administered to both parents before birth, at 2 and 7 weeks after birth, and at 1 year after birth. Results show that marital problem-solving ability did not change but that marital satisfaction diminished significantly over time. Crying was the main child variable that affected marital satisfaction. Fathers' self-efficacy contributed positively to marital problem solving and negatively to paternal insomnia. Both maternal and paternal insomnia affected spouses' insomnia. As infant sleep problems may worsen preexisting parental insomnia, it is recommended that first-time parents be informed about treatments of insomnia.

1285,"Crying, feeding and sleeping patterns in 1 to 12‐month‐old infants","Summary The crying, feeding and sleeping patterns of 270 infants 0–12 months old were studied using a 24‐hour schedule included in a questionnaire given to mothers visiting four well‐baby clinics in Finland in 1987–88. Of these infants 78 were under3, 84 were 3–5, 65 were 6–8 and 43 were over 9 months old. The results showed that the infants less than 3 months old slept on average 15–2 hours per day, whereas those over 9 months slept 13–4 hours. The sleeping periods were longer at night. Continuous night‐time sleep for at least 6 hours was noted in 35% of the infants under 3 months old and the proportion increased to 72% by the age of 9–12 months. The youngest infants were fed on average 6–7 times per day at 2‐ to 3‐hour intervals in the daytime and at 4‐ to 6‐hour intervals at night. The number of feedings decreased slightly with age. The average total crying time decreased from 1–6 hours per day for the youngest group to M hours for the 9–12 months old. At the time of the study, 23 mothers felt the need for help because of excessive crying or night waking. The help needed ranged from information about colic and child care, help with housework or the baby and encouragement. Of the mothers who needed help, a significantly higher proportion had a first‐born baby compared with those not in need of help. There were also significant differences in the mothers’ perception of the cry and feelings towards it. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell.

13510,Temporal patterns of infant regulatory behaviors in relation to maternal mood and soothing strategies,"This study investigates the temporal patterning of infant self-regulatory behaviors (crying/fussing, sleeping) in relation to both infant (age, sex, regulatory problems) and maternal variables (soothing behaviors, mood). Self-regulatory and soothing behaviors were assessed in 121 mother-infant dyads (4–44 weeks) by the Baby’s Day Diary at 5 min intervals over 3 days. Further infant characteristics and maternal mood were assessed by questionnaires (DASS, CES-D, STAI) and the Diagnostic Interview for the Assessment of Regulatory Problems in Infancy and Toddlerhood. Data were analyzed using generalized additive mixed models. Negative maternal mood was associated with a deviant course of crying/fussing during the day. Body contact was associated with reduced variability in the 24 h course of sleep. Mother-infant transactional processes—above and beyond known relationships with overall levels of crying/fussing and sleeping—might play out on the temporal dimension of infant regulatory behaviors.

1372,"Genetic liability, environment, and the development of fussiness in toddlers: The roles of maternal depression and parental responsiveness","Using a longitudinal, prospective adoption design, the authors of this study examined the effects of the environment (adoptive parents' depressive symptoms and responsiveness) and genetic liability of maternal depression (inferred by birth mothers' major depressive disorder [MDD]) on the development of fussiness in adopted children between 9 and 18 months old. The sample included 281 families linked through adoption, with each family including 4 individuals (i.e., adopted child, birth mother, adoptive father and mother). Results showed that adoptive mothers' depressive symptoms when their child was 9 months old were positively associated with child fussiness at 18 months. A significant interaction between birth mothers' MDD and adoptive mothers' responsiveness indicated that children of birth mothers with MDD showed higher levels of fussiness at 18 months when adoptive mothers had been less responsive to the children at 9 months. However, in the context of high levels of adoptive mothers' responsiveness, children of birth mothers with MDD did not show elevated fussiness at 18 months. Findings are discussed in terms of gene–environment interactions in the intergenerational risk transmission of depression.

Mothers kept a baby diary. A structured interview with the mothers was conducted. When the babies were 4 mo old, mothers completed a temperament questionnaire. The colic complaint group was subdivided using the Wessel criteria. Infants from the colic complaint group who did not meet these criteria did not differ from control Ss in any of the parameters derived from the diaries. However, the mothers of this group described significantly heightened negative affect and cognitions of being rejected in response to the crying. Findings indicate that in regard to the colic problem, attention must be paid not only to the characteristics of the child, but also to aspects of maternal perception and processing of the crying problem.

144,"Maternal anxiety versus depressive disorders: Specific relations to infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems","Background: Maternal depression has been associated with excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems, but the specificity of maternal depression, as compared with maternal anxiety remains unclear and manifest disorders prior to pregnancy have been widely neglected. In this prospective longitudinal study, the specific associations of maternal anxiety and depressive disorders prior to, during and after pregnancy and infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems were investigated in the context of maternal parity. Methods: In the Maternal Anxiety in Relation to Infant Development (MARI) Study, n = 306 primiparous and multiparous women were repeatedly interviewed from early pregnancy until 16 months post partum with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Women (CIDI‐V) to assess DSM‐IV anxiety and depressive disorders. Information on excessive infant crying, feeding and sleeping problems was obtained from n = 286 mothers during postpartum period via questionnaire and interview (Baby‐DIPS). Results: Findings from this study revealed syndrome‐specific risk constellations for maternal anxiety and depressive disorders as early as prior to pregnancy: Excessive infant crying (10.1%) was specifically associated with maternal anxiety disorders, especially in infants of younger and lower educated first‐time mothers. Feeding problems (36.4%) were predicted by maternal anxiety (and comorbid depressive) disorders in primiparous mothers and infants with lower birth weight. Infant sleeping problems (12.2%) were related to maternal depressive (and comorbid anxiety) disorders irrespective of maternal parity. Conclusions: Primiparous mothers with anxiety disorders may be more prone to anxious misinterpretations of crying and feeding situations leading to an escalation of mother–infant interactions. The relation between maternal depressive and infant sleeping problems may be better explained by a transmission of unsettled maternal sleep to the fetus during pregnancy or a lack of daily structure and bedtime routine with the infant. Maternal disorders prior to pregnancy require more attention in research and clinical practice.

14510,The relevance of infant outcome measures: A pilot-RCT comparing Baby Triple P positive parenting program with care as usual,"Problems in infant mental health such as the ability to experience, regulate, and express emotional states is expressed in behavioral problems like excessive crying, feeding, and sleeping problems. Parenting programs are popular but their effectiveness on infant mental health remains uncertain. Possibly, because recent studies have focused only on parental and parent–child measures while they miss to assess infant behavioral measures. The goal of this pilot study is to fill in this gap by assessing infantile behavioral measures. We investigated the acceptance and first indicators of efficacy of the universal group parenting training Baby Triple P (BTP) compared to a care as usual (CAU) control condition focusing on early behavioral problems. In all, 49 couples were randomly allocated to receive either eight BTP sessions before birth and per telephone after birth or to take part in CAU. Infant behavior was assessed with a diary and a structured diagnostic interview. Parental self-report measures of partnership quality and parental competence were assessed before birth, 10 weeks after birth and at 6-month follow-up. Since the parent training was conducted before the birth of the child, the child’s mental health could not be assessed before the parent training. Thus, for this variable no within measurement (pre–post) could be carried out and intention-to-treat analysis was not possible. However, a between group analysis comparing BTP against CAU took place to assess effectiveness of BTP on children’s mental health. Mothers and fathers rated the program as feasible and relevant. Results indicate significant group differences in crying behavior 6 months after birth to the benefit of the intervention group. No beneficial outcomes were found for feeding and sleeping problems in infants or partnership quality, parental sense of competence in parents. Due to an unrepresentative high level of education of the participating parents and the small sample size, these findings can be considered preliminary. Nevertheless, these results allow to further investigate the effectivity of BTP in large-scale clinical trials. Behavioral diaries or diagnostic interviews for early mental health problems should be routinely implemented in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in order not to miss possible behavioral changes in infants.

1464,Inter-rater reliability and acceptance of the structured diagnostic interview for regulatory problems in infancy,"Background: Regulatory problems such as excessive crying, sleeping–and feeding difficulties in infancy are some of the earliest precursors of later mental health difficulties emerging throughout the lifespan. In the present study, the inter-rater reliability and acceptance of a structured computer-assisted diagnostic interview for regulatory problems (Baby-DIPS) was investigated. Methods: Using a community sample, 132 mothers of infants aged between 3 and 18 months (mean age = 10 months) were interviewed with the Baby-DIPS regarding current and former (combined = lifetime) regulatory problems. Severity of the symptoms was also rated. The interviews were conducted face-to-face at a psychology department at the university (51.5 %), the mother’s home (23.5 %), or via telephone (25.0 %). Inter-rater reliability was assessed with Cohen’s kappa (k). A sample of 48 mothers and their interviewers filled in acceptance questionnaires after the interview. Results: Good to excellent inter-rater reliability on the levels of current and lifetime regulatory problems ( k = 0.77–0.98) were found. High inter-rater agreement was also found for ratings of severity ( ICC = 0.86–0.97). Participants and interviewers’ overall acceptance ratings of the computer-assisted interview were favourable. Acceptance scores did not differ between interviews that revealed one or more clinically relevant regulatory problem(s) compared to those that revealed no regulatory problems. Conclusions: The Baby-DIPS was found to be a reliable instrument for the assessment of current and lifetime problems in crying and sleeping behaviours. The computer-assisted version of the Baby-DIPS was well accepted by interviewers and mothers. The Baby-DIPS appears to be well-suited for research and clinical use to identify infant regulatory problems.

148,Inconsolable infant crying and maternal postpartum depressive symptoms,"Objective: To quantify the extent to which maternal report of inconsolable infant crying, rather than colic (defined by Wessel’s criteria of daily duration of fussing and crying > 3 hours), is associated with maternal postpartum depressive symptoms. Methods: Participants were 587 mothers who were recruited shortly before or after delivery and followed longitudinally. At 5 to 6 weeks postpartum, mothers recorded the duration and mode (fussing, crying, or inconsolable crying) of their infant’s distress by using the Baby’s Day Diary. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) was administered at enrollment and at 8 weeks postpartum. Using regression models that included baseline EPDS scores and multiple confounders, we examined associations of colic and inconsolable crying with later maternal EPDS scores at 8 weeks postpartum. Results: Sixty mothers (10%) met the EPDS threshold for ""possible depression"" (score ≥ 9) at 8 weeks postpartum. For mothers reporting > 20 minutes of inconsolable crying per day, the adjusted odds ratio for an EPDS score ≥ 9 was 4.0 (95% confidence interval: 2.0–8.1), whereas the adjusted odds ratio for possible depression in mothers whose infants had colic was 2.0 (95% confidence interval: 1.1–3.7). These associations persisted after adjusting for baseline depression symptoms. Conclusions: Maternal report of inconsolable infant crying may have a stronger association with postpartum depressive symptoms than infant colic. Asking a mother about her ability to soothe her infant may be more relevant for potential intervention than questions about crying and fussing duration alone.

1571,Distress tolerance and emotion regulation: Promoting maternal well-being across the transition to parenthood,"Objective: This study examined the association between newborns’ daily crying and five measures of new mothers’ emotional states. Design: One hundred seven new mothers responded via a one-time, anonymous, online survey that assessed their stress, well-being, emotion regulation, frustration, and coping skills. Mothers also reported their infant’s daily cry duration. Results: Average daily crying was related to mothers’ emotional experiences, and relations also existed among the five mental health measures. Regression models indicate the strongest predictors of frustration were infant’s average cry duration, maternal well-being, and infant’s health status at enrollment. Conclusion: Mental health professionals can support families through the normative, but often stressful, experience of their infant’s cries. However, a re-evaluation of the clinical criteria for excessive crying is needed, as the results suggest that mothers whose infants cry considerably less than the widely used Wessel’s 3-hour-per-day criterion for excessive crying experience significant negative mental health.

1623,Relationship between duration of crying/fussy behavior and actigraphic sleep measures in early infancy,"Objective: The objective of the study is to understand the relationship between sleep development and crying episodes during early infancy more accurately by longitudinal and objective sleep evaluations. Design: The study is designed as a prospective longitudinal study of infants in the first 4 months of life. Methods: This study included 31 healthy term infants. At approximately 4- to 6-week intervals, when the infants were aged 4–6 weeks, 8–10 weeks, and 14–16 weeks, their mothers recorded the duration of crying/fussy behavior of infants in a timetable and attached an actigraph to the infants for 3 days. The relationship between 24-h crying/fussy behavior duration and actigraphic sleep measures was examined from both a cross-sectional (age group) and longitudinal (within-infants) perspective. Interactions with diverse covariates were studied by multiple regression analysis. Results: A significant correlation was found between 24-h crying/fussy behavior duration and proportion of active sleep in infants at 14–16 weeks and in within-infant relationships. Among potential covariates, gestational age and co-sleeping had a significant impact on proportion of active sleep. Results of multiple regression analysis showed that gestational age and co-sleeping were positively associated with proportion of active sleep, whereas 24-h crying/behavior duration was not associated with proportion of active sleep. Conclusions: Subsiding of early crying and decreasing of proportion of active sleep are parallel phenomena in some infants. However, this association was thought to be attributable to the influence of covariates, including co-sleeping or gestational age. The underlying mechanisms regulating these developmental processes might overlap with one another, as covariates that affect one process could affect the other.

16610,"Effect of excessive infant crying on resting BP, HRV and cardiac autonomic control in childhood","Objective: Early life stress has been shown to influence the developing autonomic nervous system. Stressors in infancy may program the autonomic nervous system resting state set point, affecting cardiovascular function in later life. Excessive crying may be an indicator of increased stress arousal in infancy. We hypothesized that excessive infant crying is related to altered cardiac autonomic nervous system activity and increased blood pressure at age 5−6 years. Methods: In the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development study, excessive crying, maternal burden of infant care and maternal aggressive behavior in the 13 th week after birth (range 11−16 weeks) were reported using questionnaires. Blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability and indicators of cardiac autonomic nervous system activity (sympathetic drive by pre-ejection period, parasympathetic drive by respiratory sinus arrhythmia) were measured at age 5−6 years during rest. Inclusion criteria were singleton birth, term-born, and no reported congenital or cardiovascular problems (N = 2153 included). Results: Excessive crying (2.8%) was not associated with resting heart rate, heart rate variability, pre-ejection period, respiratory sinus arrhythmia nor with blood pressure at age 5−6 years. Conclusions: Excessive infant crying as an indicator of increased stress arousal does not seem to be related to resting activity of the autonomic nervous system or blood pressure at age 5−6. Potential associations may become visible under stressed conditions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)","Smarius, Laetitia J. C.

17510,Descriptive figures for differences in parenting and infant night-time distress in the first three months of age,"Aim: To provide descriptive figures for infant distress and associated parenting at night in normal London home environments during the first three months of age. Background: Most western infants develop long night-time sleep periods by four months of age. However, 30% of infants in many countries sleep for short periods and cry out on waking in the night: the most common type of infant sleep behaviour problem. Preventive interventions may help families and improve services. There is evidence that ‘limit-setting’ parenting, which is common in western cultures, supports the development of settled infant night-time behaviour. However, a recent review has challenged this and argued that this form of parenting risks distressing infants. This study describes limit-setting parenting as practiced in London, compares it with ‘infant-cued’ parenting and measures the associated infant distress. Methods: Longitudinal infrared video, diary and questionnaire observations comparing a General-Community ( n = 101) group and subgroups with a Bed-Sharing ( n = 19) group on measures of infant and parenting behaviours at night. Findings: General- Community parents took longer to detect and respond to infant waking and signalling, and to begin feeding, compared with the highly infant-cued care provided by Bed-Sharing parents. The average latency in General-Community parents’ responding to infant night-time waking was 3.5min, during which infants fuss/cried for around 1min. Compared with Bed-Sharing parenting, General-Community parenting was associated with increased infant distress of around 30min/night at two weeks, reducing to 12 min/night by three months of age.However, differences in infant distress between General-Community subgroups adopting limit-setting versus infant-cued parenting were not large or statistically significant at any age. The figures provide descriptive evidence about limit-setting parenting which may counter some doubts about this form of parenting and help parents and professionals to make choices.

1841,Parent characteristics and conceptualizations associated with the emergence of infant colic,"The goal of the present study was to examine parental characteristics associated with the emergence of infant colic using a prospective longitudinal study. When infants were 2 weeks of age, parent measures of personality, marital satisfaction, parenting stress, and social support were obtained. In addition, parents were asked about their definition of colic. When infants were 6 weeks of age, parents completed a 4 day, 24 hour cry diary. Parents also completed a stress questionnaire. Based on the fussing/crying data derived from the diaries, 22 of the 128 infants were identified as having colic. Results showed colic infants to have distinctive crying and fussing patterns. Differences in parent conceptualizations of colic were also identified for colic and non-colic families. Results indicated that parental variables, particularly parenting stress and marital satisfaction, may have contributed to the parents' report of excessive crying and fussing.

1854,Infant temperament and parent use of food to soothe predict change in weight-for-length across infancy: early risk factors for childhood obesity,"Objectives: Greater weight gain in infancy is a risk factor for childhood obesity. The present study examined the interaction between infant temperament and parent use of food to soothe infant distress (FTS) as predictors of weight gain across the first 2 years of life. Subjects/Methods: A total of 160 mother–infant dyads were recruited into a longitudinal study. Infant temperament was assessed by parents through a questionnaire (surgency, negativity) and by observer ratings (surgency, irritability) during a laboratory visit when infants were 6 months old. Parents also completed a 3-day infant cry diary when their children were 6 months of age to assess when they used food in response to infant cry/fuss bouts. Infant weight/length was measured in the lab at 6 and 18 months. Multiple regressions were run to test the moderating effect of FTS on weight gain. Results: Significant interactions were revealed for both measures of surgency and parent FTS in predicting weight gain. Surgent infants whose parents had a greater tendency to use FTS had greater weight-for-length gain in 1 year than if their parents tended to use less FTS. The interaction between observer ratings of irritability and parent FTS was also significant but in an unexpected direction. Conclusions: The findings point to the role of temperament, specifically surgency, in weight gain during infancy, but only if their parents used FTS. Surgency may have evoked this feeding practice that increased their health risk.

186,The effect of excessive crying on the development of emotion regulation,"The goal of this study was to examine the effect of excessive crying in early infancy on the development of emotion self-regulation. Cry diaries were used to categorize excessive criers and typical criers at 6 wks of age. At 5 and 10 mo of age, infants and mothers participated in procedures to elicit infant reactivity and regulation during a frustration task and maternal sensitivity and intrusiveness during a free-play session. Last, maternal ratings of temperament were obtained. Results reveal excessive criers to show higher levels of negative reactivity than typical criers. Excessive criers also demonstrated lower regulation, but this finding was only significant for male infants. Boys in the excessive criers group exhibited the lowest level of emotion self-regulation. Maternal behavior and ratings of temperament at 5 and 10 mo failed to distinguish the 2 cry groups. The findings suggest that excessive crying may influence the developmental trajectory of the ability of boys to self-regulate emotion. The hypothesized processes involved in this outcome are discussed (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","Stifter, Cynthia A. and Spinrad, Tracy L.",1,1870
1921,Accurate assessment of mother &amp; infant sleep: How many diary days are required?,"Purpose: The purpose of the study was to determine the number of days of diary data collection needed to reliably measure mother and infant sleep-wake pattern. Study Design and Methods: Twenty healthy adult mothers and their healthy term gestation infants age 4 to 10 weeks postnatal participated in a single group, cross-sectional design. Mothers completed a paper and pencil sleep-wake diary divided into 15-minute time periods. Data were collected in the home environment over a 4-day period. Mother and infant sleep and wake as well as infant feeding and cry were summarized and compared using between 1 and 4 days of data. Reliability was evaluated by correlating results obtained using from 1 to 4 days of data. Results: Mean values for mother and infant sleep and activity variables did not differ significantly by day. Correlation among values calculated using increases in number of days of data showed adequate reliability (r ≥ 0.80) when 3 days of data were used. Clinical Implications: Clinical measures should be valid and reliable. Due to day-to-day changes in maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern, a diary collected over 1 day may not provide adequate sleep information. These study findings indicate that 3 days of diary data are sufficient to reliably measure mother and infant sleep patterns. When using a diary to assess maternal and infant sleep-wake pattern in clinical practice or in clinically-based research, a 3-day period is suggested.

1931,Infant temperament and parental stress in 3-month-old infants after surgery for complex congenital heart disease,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify and compare differences in temperament and maternal stress between infants with complex congenital heart disease and healthy controls at 3 months of age. METHODS: Study sample was drawn from an existing longitudinal study examining growth in infants with congenital heart disease when compared with healthy controls. Infant temperament and parental stress were measured in 129 mother-infant dyads. Inclusion criteria for infants with congenital heart disease were > or = 36-week postmenstrual age, > or = 2500 g at birth, surgery in first 6 weeks of life, and no major congenital anomalies or genetic syndromes. The Early Infancy Temperament Questionnaire and Parent Stress Index were the assessment tools used. RESULTS: Infants with single ventricular (SV) physiology were more negative in mood (F = 7.14, p < .001) and less distractible (F = 5.00, p < .008) than the biventricular physiology or Control (C) infant groups. The demands of care for infants with congenital heart disease were a source of stress when compared with Control infants (p < .05). Five of 6 subscales of the Child Domain were significant sources of stress in the SV group compared with biventricle and Control groups. Negative mood and difficulty to soothe were predictors for Child Domain and Total Life Stress in SV infants. CONCLUSION: The demands of parenting an irritable infant with SV physiology put these mothers at risk for high levels of stress. Results suggest the need for predischarge anticipatory guidance for parents to better understand and respond to the behavioral style of their infants, in particular, infants with SV physiology.","Torowicz, D. and Irving, S.

197,Maternal psychological state and infant’s temperament at three months,"Objective: The study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between maternal psychological state in the perinatal period and the child’s temperament at 3 months postpartum. Background: The perinatal period is a phase of intense psychological complexity which may increase the risk of the development, or a recurrence of psychological disturbances in parents. The current literature highlights the potential negative effects of a perturbed maternal psychological state on fetal and newborn development. Among the consequences of fetal exposure to maternal states of depression or anxiety are increased inconsolable crying and sleep disturbance in the newborn, difficult temperament, motor and cognitive development delays in children and a higher risk of depression in adolescence. Methods: A longitudinal design using self-report measures of maternal mood, and maternal report of the infant’s temperament, was used. The sample comprised 107 Italian, low-risk nulliparous women. Maternal and infant variables were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 3 months postpartum. The variables measured included: maternal depression, anxiety, prenatal attachment, alexithymia, social support, maternal bonding with parents, stressful events, and the infant’s temperament. Results: Higher scores of antenatal depression and postnatal state anxiety were independent predictors of increased temperamental difficulties of the baby. Conclusion: The results support the hypothesis that maternal perinatal states of depression or anxiety are associated with increased difficulty in the temperament of the baby as perceived by mothers. This therefore supports the need for prevention-treatment programmes from the early stages of pregnancy.

2056,Infantile colic in a psychodynamic and nursing perspective,"The aim of this study was to illuminate the interaction between mother and infant in the condition of infantile colic and compare this with the interaction in a non-colic group. Infantile colic was defined as daily inconsolable crying. The sample, 21 mother-infant dyads, were recruited from six welfare centres in the north-west (a middle-class area) of Stockholm, A non-colic group, ten mother-infant dyads, were used as control group. The methods used were observing the feeding situation, interviewing the mother about pregnancy, labour and delivery, mother's first contact with the newborn, maternity stay, duration of breastfeeding, the infant's crying and medication, mother's food habits, etc. The mother was then asked to fill in a Sleep/Activity Scale for the seven following days and nights. A questionnaire was sent six months post-partum to follow up the situation. Labour and delivery was a positive event for most of the mothers and all the fathers had taken part in it. The observations showed a tendency of disturbed mother-infant interaction during feeding. When the infant was crying it was usually the mother who took care and also developed several ways to try to console the infant.

210,Association between life stress during pregnancy and infant crying in the first six months postpartum: A prospective longitudinal study,"Objective: To examine prospectively the relationship between prenatal life stress and infant crying/fussing during the first 6 months of postnatal life, taking into account an array of confounders suggested in the literature. Design: Prospective longitudinal study of a convenient sample, with data points in pregnancy and at about 6 weeks, 3, and 6 months postpartum. Methods: The study included 86 pregnant women who completed a standardized, validated and widely used questionnaire on negative life changes experienced in the preceding 12 months. Women were grouped by median split on the impact score of negative life changes. Demographic, obstetric and lifestyle variables were obtained from pre- and postnatal interviews and from medical records in order to be taken into account as possible confounders. At all three postnatal data points, mothers kept a validated 5-day 24-h behavior diary to assess durations of infant crying/fussing. Results: Infants of mothers with high scores of negative life changes exhibited more crying/fussing than infants born to mothers with low negative change scores, throughout the first half year postpartum, but particularly at ages 3 and 6 months. These results do not seem to be spurious due to the confounders considered in this report or to recording bias. Conclusion: Prenatal life stress is associated with infant crying/fussing in the first half year after delivery. To prevent or reduce infant crying and to foster a well-adapted parent-infant relationship, professionals attending expectant mothers should consider their emotional condition. If required, support should be provided already in pregnancy.
